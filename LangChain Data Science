Business Context

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized how we interact with technology by enabling natural and coherent conversations, significantly enhancing organizational productivity as helpful assistants. This development is a result of extensive processes:

- Supervised Pre-training: Establishing a vast knowledge base through compute-intensive training.
- Instruction-style Supervised Fine-tuning: Adapting the LLM as a high-quality assistant using curated dialog datasets.
- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): Aligning responses with human values and expectations.

Today's advanced LLM-powered chatbots can query databases, analyze data, and fetch answers to contextual questions from documents or the web.

This project will explore the LangChain framework to develop a Data Science Assistant that automates tasks by converting natural language requests into executable code. This assistant will handle:

- Data Analysis
- Data Science & Machine Learning Modeling
- Relational Database Querying
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Contextual Answers

This project aims to significantly impact business and research by automating daily coding tasks related to data analysis, data science, and database querying. Such automation will enhance efficiency, improve code accuracy, and make data science more accessible to those unfamiliar with coding.

From a broader perspective, the capability of large-scale LLMs to understand and execute natural language commands represents a significant advancement in automation within computer science. This project will demonstrate the growing potential of Generative AI to transform commands into programming code, a task traditionally reserved for human developers.
