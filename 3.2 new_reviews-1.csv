I cannot open the app anymore,poor
I have been begging for a refund from this app for over a month and nobody is replying me,poor
Very costly for the premium version (approx Indian Rupees 910 per year). Better to download the premium version of this app from apkmos website and use it. Microsoft to do list app is far more better.,poor
"Used to keep me organized, but all the 2020 UPDATES have made a mess of things !!! Y cudn't u leave well enuf alone ??? Guess ur techies feel the need to keep making changes to justify continuing to collect their salary !!! 🤤🤤🤤",poor
Dan Birthday Oct 28,poor
It has changed how I viewed my different lists. Now they are all jumbled together and I can't find what I need.,poor
"I'm only looking for a grocery list app but every time I tap away from the app I have to tap again (after opening it again) to see the list. I can't find a way to keep a certain list showing when I open or reopen the app. eta: in response to the reply, it doesn't work like that on my phone. Even if the grocery list is showing, when I open another app and then go back to the any.do app, the list of lists is showing and I have to retap to get the grocery list to show again.",poor
"Reset my free trial, new phone I'd like to see if it's better.",poor
How do to stop monthly payment because i don't use this app anymore,poor
"I complain about not crashes and it was immediately fixed!Good job!! Now the crashes have returned! I really need it fixed because I need to change apps otherwise 😩 I followed your instructions on deleting the data, etc but it just now crashed again. I am a patient person and I have used Any Do for years but let's try one more time and then I will have to find another app. It crashed again 😑",poor
"Constant crashing. After reading all the negative reviews, I Uninstalled it from all my devices. **Canceled subscription. App was great, until it crashed. After spending more than a hour setting it up on my Samsung tablet, it will not run. Cannot even get it to start. Too bad. In the past, my experiences have been good with this app. Guess I will see how long it takes to crash on my cell phone. So much for multi-device sync. Such a disappointment. **see above, for new comment added.",poor
"Widgets are useless because they always show all tasks I have, regardless of category. There's no option to show only a specific category like groceries so they're all mixed up with to-do list tasks. Do developers even care about usability? Isn't it a software design 101?",poor
Horrible app. It doesn't do as described. Absolutely no support!,poor
"Update October 2020: new update deleted all of my tasks, forced me to create an account, and now only bare minimum is free. Finding a new app. Been using this for years and loved it. With each update you get less and less free. It just auto updated and now I can't have reoccurring reminders without paying. Unless you count defaulting to every Monday. It wouldn't even allow me to update a long time weekly reminder",poor
Did not realize there was a charge for this app do not want this app.,poor
"Spams notifications of how many tasks other users have completed this week. Who on earth would care? Uninstalled. **Update: Developer responded that this was a once off experiment. I think this was actually the third time I received this notification. Also, experimental spam is still spam",poor
Downloaded first thing it trys to do is do a con. Not impressed.,poor
No longer works with Alexa. What happened??,poor
it doesn't show any list,poor
Do not download,poor
This app is not what I wanted at all.,poor
Unnecessary pop up. Really annoying and counterproductive,poor
They recently started sending spammy notifications every week or so. Please stop.,poor
"Shows tasks assigned to others in widget. A major missing feature for any serious projects, is some way to know if a task you're currently adding to a long list, already exists. Some kind of an automatic search through the existing tasks - at least the tasks in the current list - while typing in a new task. Other than that, this is great. Good job! _Task search in the web app is an extra step and not intuitive._ Using a separate search feature to check every new task you're adding, is absurd.",poor
7 days for free and then you pay. Plus too complicated for some simple tasks,poor
Update: thanks for your response. I would ask the developers to check their own app. There is NO monthly subscription option in the app. Old review: No monthly subscriptions? Why should I be forced to subscribe for a year? I am definitely not subscribing for a year in one go. This is ridiculously desperate.,poor
Expensive paywall preventing access to features in wanting to try out,poor
"I was about to pay for this app when I noticed a bug. It does not effectively sync tasks and events from the Google Calendar. Numerous issues, and you can't even mark those events as over. Sorry, not going to subscribe to this. I have no idea why this app is so famous. It's quite bad, in my opinion.",poor
Worst application no task information on screen,poor
"I downloaded this app to try for my task list but i see there're not many functions, choices of sounds, color labels... to make the task fun, dissapointed with the score i saw on Google Play. The worst point is this app forced me to pay for it without any awareness. I checked my Google play account before the trial end, i didn't see any Subscription plan from Any.do, but after the trial, it charged me yearly plan for this App. Bad way to trick people to pay for this app.",poor
"Shameless App Ever, Waste Money !!! I have subscribed and have been charged for the whole year. Though no features of premium appeared. Can someone clarify the reason????",poor
I am not providing email addresses or google or Facebook accounts for a todo list,poor
Uninstalled it as soon as it started sending me Ad notifications. Why does any developer think this is acceptable? Disgusting.,poor
I have subscribed and have been charged for the whole year. Though no features of premium appeared. Can someone clarify the reason????,poor
Have to pay premium if you want to put multiple reminders a day,poor
"I have tried I installing this on two separate Android devices with no luck. I can not add my calendars. I put the widget on the home screen. It says I need to add my calendars and has a button to add them, but nothing happens when I tap the button.",poor
Prayer Ubde,poor
such a useless and greedy app only wants money as is chargeable after 7 days do you have shame i want to give you 0 star,poor
Yes i what,poor
Waste,poor
"Really cumbersome, is not easy to use",poor
Was charged for the year instead of monthly,poor
"Not free, cannot delete account",poor
Will not enable me to unsubscribe!,poor
Dindigul,poor
Latest update deleted all my tasks and lists! Have to start all over and try to remember what my list items were. I'll be looking for a new app.,poor
Features for the free version are just disappointing.,poor
Locking basic features behind a paywall is kinda weird,poor
Soo awkward i can't able to sign *up* 😭 Sick app,poor
Hangs when setting up Google Assistant,poor
Subscription?? How does this application figure that it can be a subscription application? Ridiculous Update after developer response: This is not a subscription application. You are not Netflix or Adobe. This should be a standalone app quit trying to milk people's money. You can say anything you want. THIS WILL NEVER BE A SUBSCRIPTION APPLICATION. STOP BEING RIDICULOUS.,poor
good,poor
"Hopeless customer service. I paid for the premium version, had a problem with its sharing function, emailed customer support for a solution, was told it would take 2 business days for a response (which was hopeless enough), now over 5 business days later I've not received a response.",poor
Duplicates files attached and you have to constantly delete. FIX THE BUGS.,poor
Used to work so well earlier. Now it doesn't work at all!! Junk!!,poor
Frustrating. Apparently its meant to sync grocery lists with Google home but doesn't. Absolutely no info on how to set it up,poor
Too complicated to use,poor
Forced sign in,poor
Work on it,poor
"I should have looked through ""most recent"" instead of ""most relevant"" reviews. It's far too limited for me in it's free state and I'm not interested in paying for a subscription just to unlock what should be basic functionality in a to do list app.",poor
do not for showing or refund&refuse about my persional privacy.,poor
"It doesn't have sub lists, e.g. ""child/school"", ""child/health"" so you see too many lists or too many tasks at once (which is overwelming).",poor
Not usefull and even they charge some money :),poor
This app is absolutely useless. Because of this i missed an important event because the reminder alarm supposedly forgot to rang. Its pathetic and useless.,poor
Is the app or web platform down today? Can't seem to login either.,poor
Have to pay for daily reminders... My phone does that free,poor
The app is amazing - but the vibrations! So annoying!! Pls let me turn them off.,poor
Dipak day Cox,poor
Very bad,poor
Location reminders don't work in medium power saving mode.. And all I got in reply was a copy paste solution and a trouble shoot link.,poor
Fed up with interruption in each matter I note. Not worth the while HAVING there are far too many condescending workers out inte cyber world who refuse to take no for an answer.,poor
"Really dissappointed in this app. Was using it to schedule my customers appointments. As soon as the new version came out, I lost everything. Going back to paper as at least my paper won't delete everything. A terrible app for business owners and scheduling appointments. Absolutely horrible and I'm very angry.",poor
Thanks to your stupid update I lost ALL of my appointment dates... Terrible garbage.,poor
"I miss Cal. The updates destroyed it, turned this into a cookie-cutter to-do app. It's a shame.",poor
Was great but can't connect with other people since last update. Invite will go out and will even receive the invitation but doesn't link and have had no luck with customer support,poor
I WAS TRYING FOR DAYS TO UN SUBSCRIBE. BUT OF COURSE THAT I was charged. Absolutely no support. Horrible and disgusting tactics,poor
"Update ruined app Last update re-formatted the ""Plan My Day"" function so the ability to schedule tasks for that day or postpone into the future is unusable, so I have 50+ tasks and to way to arrange them into a comprehensive order. Contacted the developer who emailed me back after 4 days asking for a screenshot of the problem, so I sent it right back. 3 days later - no response from the developer, no fix, nothing. Update9/8: no fix, moved to aCalTasks +",poor
👎,poor
"Does not do weekly reminders correctly. I opened a bug report, and was told that it was a known bug. A reminder app that gets reminders at the wrong time is a big 'no' from me.",poor
"In app purchases significantly impact experience. £16 a year for features such as recurring tasks, you're having a laugh",poor
You need an account because they want to track your cookies for ads,poor
Need to create an account to use it.,poor
"Is NOTHING free anymore??. It looks like a good app but as soon as you open it, it gives the subscription rates 🤬🤬🤬🤬. I uninstalled immediately. Don't bother. Believe it or not, some people don't enjoy being nickle and dimed!",poor
Very bad,poor
Pratz,poor
i sent an ivite to people and everyone got over 50 emails for the one invite. What a joke of a an app.,poor
I have to sync whatttt gtfohhhhhh,poor
Bring back my money! Why your system stolen my money from pending subscribe? Without confirmation and notification!!!! Wheres my money???,poor
WHY IS THIS SO BUGGY NOW? WHY ARE YOU NO LONGER REALLY BEING ATTENTIVE TO QUALITY CONTROL? CANT DELETE TASK ON ONE TRY. CAN NO LONGER DELETE FINISHED TASKS WITHOUT SEVERAL ATTEMPTS. ALL COMMANDS ARE HESITANT. ALL COMMANDS REQUIRE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS. I HAVE EMAILED YOU 3 TIMES WITH NO RESPONSE. PLEASE ADVISE.,poor
Hum hai al Ghj,poor
Shabab,poor
Makes simple things extremely complicated,poor
Even after your response it doesn't change the fact that you are required to have an account to proceed. The reasoning that others do it is negligible. Only way I would rate this app better is if you had an Anonymous auto log in that can be converted to a full account on sign up or log in.,poor
The latest update now not working fine at all. It's worsening day by day. The developers now appears to have a different intention that premium paid version is purchased by the users.,poor
Just use your basic phone calendar,poor
I want to cancel the subscription.,poor
MoneyGrabber Wants you to pay premium to choose specific dates.,poor
Does not do much different than Google tasks (which is easier to use and is free). As a result I wanted a refund as I only realized this after my 7 day trial. Refunds are only given within 24 hours of their drawing their fee. Not sure that is legal for an automatic subscription after app trial.,poor
"Bekaar... bagwas.. time waste... useless.. and asking for payment, before use anyway",poor
Useless app... Set up 8 reminders during a course of 4 days and not once received any notification! Waste of money.,poor
Subscription!!!,poor
"This app met my needs until this latest update. Dislike the new format to such a degree that it's a dealbreaker. Now I have to start from scratch researching apps to find a replacement. I know, I used the free version so you don't care if I go but this is such a disappointment.",poor
It syncs EVERYTHING. terrible. you have to get the pro version in order to be able to do anything actually worth while!!!,poor
I don't found usefulness,poor
"In the calendar of Any.do, 1st of August is marked as bakr-Id, but 22nd August is not marked as Ganesha chaturthi! Is there a specific reason? or was it conveniently forgotten? Developer, please do respond. Because it depends on your response whether to buy it or not?",poor
Its a good app but the app keeps crashing when i allow this app to add to my calendar. After adding it to calendar then yhis app doesnt open. Keeps crashing,poor
"Saying free and simple is not telling people it is a 7 day free trial especially at Google play store and people only know it's a 7 day free trial after they download it. So why won't Google do anything about this app developers not mention their apps have a trial period, which results in people downloading apps for nothing. PS 95% of the app is free, until the trial period finishes.",poor
"Scam premium that bypasses GooglePlay, On the mobile app you can only buy 1 year of premium while on the website a monthly payment is possible. People buy the monthly more often and the developer listed it on its personal website only to bypass google fee, thus i need to link my card on their site too",poor
"This new layout is just awful. Just ridiculously awful. I cannot in any way fathom how this got a thumbs up from anybody. Bye bye Any.do, I'm off to download something that wasn't designed by a nine year old.",poor
You have to open an account with them. I won't be going there. Would be nice to be given the choice.,poor
"There is no option to delete the account. If i don't find this app useful, you guyz will keep my data? This is against the policies and norms",poor
Efvig,poor
Sorry way to complicated. And why would you think I want my information out on your servers? Wanted to create a weekday event spent more time trying to figure out how to do that than it took to write in a diary.,poor
Super,poor
Worked great for a few years and then the past couple of months it eats anything added to the list! I can sit and watch things drop off before my very eyes!,poor
Way over priced for what it does. Not worth it!!,poor
Delete application,poor
Laggy responses to resolved items and errors in recurring reminders,poor
Nice app,poor
No new it's repeated app,poor
It stop working and I try to reinstall it but same problem,poor
"Automatically shows the reminder Snackbar when I open other apps without me setting it up, what kind of violation is this??? Stop bugging your users unsolicitedly. Uninstalled",poor
"I love this app, but I do have one major gripe - I want an option to buy premium once (even at a higher price) and not as a monthly or yearly subscription. Edit - very unhappy with developer response to pricing. I want to buy premium for this great product they made, but it's NOT a service. This isn't Netflix. You're going to turn potential buyers away with this pricing model",poor
Atleast make a few features available .. if the customer donot like the app at initial stage than how would he/she ever think about going premium,poor
"Requires a sign up for features I have no interest in using, but can't opt out of.",poor
Did not sign up. App not even on my phone. This payment deduction will be reported and I request you refund my money immediately.,poor
Autofill on Android 10 does not work,poor
"Had charged twice but still not getting premium version access,",poor
Have have to make an account in order to use this app. There is no way around it.,poor
"Creating an account is supposed to ALLOW you, not FORCE you. Uninstalled without trying it",poor
Stop Adding Groceries Items Like an Ad,poor
Bakwas app,poor
"I don't get task notifications anymore!!! This app has become useless. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, turned on / allowed notifications in the settings yet nothing.",poor
Good improvements but still don't have nag or presisitent reminders. I missing a lot reminders accidentally,poor
"Useless, ring bells only one time, and not a good reminder",poor
Having to pay to set a recurring task is ridiculous and essentially makes the app useless to anyone who doesn't want to pay so this essentially is not a free app.,poor
There is some issue in payment.,poor
Too complicated. I need a plan to plan tasks.,poor
Everything it expects you to pay,poor
"This app is useless unless you make the monthly payment, in that case does exist other app free and only with the essential",poor
Too many features locked behind premium.,poor
Worst app,poor
"I have the same recurring tasks to do every day. I need a to-do-list reminder to buzz me when it's time. The problem with this app, is that those reminder times somehow start drifting every day, giving me different times the next day! That is an annoying fail! Screw it, I'm going elsewhere. if I find a better app, I'll let you guys know. UPDATE : Suggestion did not work, and I found an app, that does not drift. I have moved on.",poor
"OMG the UI is awful, seriously you have popup for premium every 2 seconds, there's no intuitive way see a normal calendar, you have to create an account even if you don't want to, the app is beautiful but show screen where it's impossible to understand what you have to do. It's a calendar, show a f... calendar.",poor
Not good,poor
"Trash. Yes, it has some nice nifty features but it lacks in complete necessities to actually plan your day. You can make a task, perfectly include subtasks and then add a nice color to the task. But no yellow, because that's already the fixed color of the 'priority label'. Reminders are great, except you can only have one. If I want to have a reminder on Wednesday 10AM and a reminder on Friday 6PM, I'd need a different app. Because this app only allows you to set 1 reminder. Frustrating. 0/10",poor
"Is it necessary to sign up account? While making a new account it's shows error ""oops try again later""",poor
I've been using the app for a while and since last week it has been acting weird. I don't receive reminders anymore and it's completely a waste of time to set reminders! Not very reliable right now,poor
"While it's nice program, I can justify paying for it in perpetuity. That's just insane.",poor
Have to pay for recurrent daily task.. which is the main purpose of that app.,poor
"List sharing sharing is not working. UX is straight from iOS app, terrible",poor
"Worst app I have ever used, it doesn't do anything.",poor
Raben nat s7,poor
First thing that happened upon opening is asking for payment. Good job.,poor
"I do not have much to say in regards to the app itself. It seems to function fine, but it was not the calendar app that I needed. The reason I am giving it 1 star is because I canceled my subscription and account within the seven day free trial and still got charged the yearly rate. The problem has been reported to the company. I will keep this review updated with any action from Any.Do. UPDATE: The gist of the problem is this. Any.do makes it very difficult to find out how to cancel the sub.",poor
"Unable to register with an email. Clicking""continue with email"" will just take you to a login page. Complete waste of time. I searched them first three pages of Google for a solution and found nothing. Found no solution on their help section. I don't want to register with Facebook or Google. If you include a feature, make sure it actually works.",poor
"My backup is gone, very important data deleted",poor
"Any.Forget... Had an instance of daily repeating event, that I have marked as complete today and somehow it did skip the next day and only proceeded to the day after. Kind of ""daily event with some days skipped"". So useless to me as can't be trusted for notifying about daily routine tasks. P.S. don't tell me I don't know how to setup a recurring event!!",poor
"It works okay, But I did not consent to subscribing at $28/year subscription. I thought I purchased it until I saw that it was renewed for an additional $28. It's definitely not worth that price. Very angry and ripped off. I got charged twice for something that I thought I bought outright. I will never buy anything from them. Ever",poor
Very slow app it took me 10 min just to start the app....,poor
"Updates made that are not fully tested. They need to add option to revert back to the olddd verison. that was simple to use, but most importantly it worked.",poor
Anydo,poor
"App loding ke baad peese maang raha hai, pahle bataaye , data kyo kharaab karwaya",poor
"Ruined the app by trying to get too fancy. My wife has also become frustrated with it. She has had it since it started and now struggles with it. You should be able to add a task then go straight to set time/day. But instead, you have all the other short cuts there that really aren't.",poor
I could not have any expirions about this app,poor
Terrible App. Don't waste your money.,poor
I couldn't use it,poor
Looks like a pretty good app but it doesn't sync with Alexa. Which is the main reason I installed it. Shouldn't be this difficult.,poor
"Forces you to sign up and use credentials, uninstalled.",poor
Hf,poor
Most useless app ever used! Very difficult to save anything or find anything! Put some tasks didn't get any reminders so didn't do it! Erasing this nonsense Can't even save this review,poor
Its a great app but I dont receive any events notification although I have allowed the notification to come through from this app. I really don't understand why because I have set everything correctly.,poor

"This is an overengineered list keeping app that I hate. I kept it for years in spite of that because I was in the ecosystem, but today it locked me out of my grocery list so good riddance.

This app has Malware.,poor
"Not happy, app just asked me to 'sign in' and now has deleted all my previous reminders. I had reminders set up for throughout the rest of this year and now I don't know what they were. You've put me off using your app now, what's the point if it's not reliable!!!",poor
Not Making an Account!,poor
"I was a customer of Any.Do for a while and on March 2020 i clearly asked them NOT to renew my subscription as i found a different company to provide me task manger services - Todoist. More than that - i even consult with Any.Do technical support team how to transfer my database to Todoist and over the phone, i ALSO remind them to cancel it. I received the cancellation notice and I DID NOT ask them to renew/continue any of Any.Do services. More than that - i also have the Invoice from the company i moved my services, Todoist, for the same period of time that Any.Do charged me for. After i tried to contact Any.Do they refused to refund me. Therefore, i let you and everybody to know that I WILL NOT USE ANY OF ANY.DO services anymore and recommend everyone that read this post DO NOT USE ANY.DO SERVICES or you taking a big risk that something like that will happen to you as well.",poor

Time setting is so dumb. Fix it,poor

"Many errors, the app is good but sometimes with the recurrent task do not work when I use desktop app it do not sync well and I lose many task and this is unpleasant.

"Since last 2 updates I am facing this problem that when I open the app, one or two tasks get shuffled to the top. Then I have to put it again in the planned sequence. This happens almost everytime I open the app.",poor

Rare,poor
Good app but I wish there was a monthly payment option for premium instead of annual.,poor
Pushing to hard for premium upgrade. Not interested anymore,poor
"Ill join with my fellow reviewers and say that i was very satisfied with the app when i started using it about two years ago, but since then i feel that its functionality and simplicity have been compromised, especially with the newest update that just made the app's interface (via smartphone) completely uncomfortable because i can't see my tasks laid out chronologically in an organized and pleasing way anymore.",poor
Whapp integration is bad. Barely anything works. Focus to whapp integration and seeya again,poor
"It was good until they updated it and took out the today, someday, upcoming categories out, which is how I organized everything",poor
"I found this app difficult to organize in a way that was useful for me. I couldn't separate which items showed up on my phone widget by topic, so it showed all of them which was unnecessary. I also found the reminders to plan my day annoying. It would be better with an improved calendar and prioritizing options. Last, it is extremely frustrating to try and unsubscribe from yearly renewal. It is buried deep in the info and the actual faq for this has a broken link. Super sketchy and rude.",poor
"Widget not working. Everytime i checked the next or previous month it'd be lagging and later it was just blank. Love the app but i really need the widget, sorry.",poor
no repeat alarm,poor
"Why are random items popping up on our Grocery List? Is this your way of advertising? We have purchased unnecessary items that I had never even heard of. Sun Maid Smore Bites? Nope, no one added them on. I love using the app, but this is very deceptive manipulating the grocery lists.",poor
"I switched to Any.do when Wunderlist ended. I wanted a simple interface that let me share lists and tasks with my husband. Any.do did that, but in the least efficient way possible. Our initials are the same and tiles aren't customizable, so it was impossible to tell who a task was assigned to. The app always defaulted to tasks even if I had just been using a shopping list. It was a huge pain to navigate. Not what we needed at all.",poor
Confused,poor
I like this apps but the thing is anything need to pay? So sorry to do list i only gave it 2 star and its so bad 😔,poor
Star,poor

"Google login not working at all. Tried 2 accounts, gets stuck at setting up",poor

"App shouldn't enforce sign in for use. Uninstalled. Waste of time. Edit: that sounds like optional functionality for an app labeled to do list! Not a complete blocker to using the app. For a simple ""I need to make a quick note to remind myself of later"" this isn't very good.",poor
Not what is expected,poor

The last update removed grid view and left us with a very odd task interface.,poor
This is not free. Paid one. Some features are limited till paid.,poor
"Upon making a task, setting time and date by typing them has become absurd! The app understands what it wants and acts by itself. What do you mean 'use natural language'?",poor
"Update on 25/8/20 :- worst update ever,, was moderately ok until August update. app totally dewastated. Now it is even lags like hell. Not even able to strike down a task after doing it in one touch 👎👎👎",poor
App is good & I am using it since 6 months now BUT NOW A DAYS AUTOMATICALLY SHUTDOWN WHOLE WORKING,poor
Got into the help menu by accident. Can't get back to my lists.,poor
"I used this app every day for years, but just uninstalled and changed to a different to do list app because of the new layout. The grid was much easier to use and better looking.",poor
I have bought it yet it displays ERROR IN VERIFYING MY WHATSAPP INTEGRATION 😡😡😡😡,poor
"A lot of basic features locked away behind a pay wall, not very customisable imo . Not the right to-do list app for me.",poor
Ok it was good app but all the good feature are in premium no use of downloading if I'm not satisfied why would i pay for a premium one,poor
"It duplicates events, often with the incorrect time, and delete events I invite other to. Very aggravating.",poor
Constant prompts for trials and upgrades. Super annoying.,poor
"My rating is just based on my needs. The app says it has recurring tasks, it does not. It does have recurring reminders for ""on going"" tasks which may be useful in certain applications. The result of which being if you click on a task that you do everyday it puts the next reminder on the list giving the illusion the task was left undone. The exact opposite of what a checklist should do. If you want actual individual repeating tasks or list this is not the app.",poor
"Beautifully designed interface, but VERY CLICK-BAITY / PUSHY - I would NOT recommend.",poor
"Bare Bones. Integrations are a lie. You have to use a third party app to make it work and Zapier is garbage. Grocery list is kind of cool. Calendar has that annoying Apple style slide that hides evens and is impossible to read instead of traditional blocks. Support button is for bug fixes only, so premium support is also a lie.",poor
I'm experiencing issues with the reminder option. Whenever I set a reminder I get neither the notification or the popup which as a result makes me forget things. This issue wasn't there before. What can be done to solve this?,poor
Rimnder alram ka bhi option h ya nhi,poor
Loved this app but I prefer writing things down,poor
Ordinary updates delete reminders,poor
Why pay for such simplicity?,poor
"For an app that's meant to help me organise my time more effectively, I didn't expect it would take the longest time to boot up compared to all the utility apps on my device... Really nice UI though...",poor
Why so expensive? Microsoft Task or reminder offer most of the features that this app has. Could you please decrease the price a little bit? Or give me some discount? Atleast for the first Year?,poor
"I like it at lot, but it seems like recently, this v thing is taking out my battery, hogging memory, and using data more than chrome which I use constantly. Until someone can help me figure this out, or if this high usage of phone resources is normal, I can't rate it any higher. I might even have to remove it and search for an alternative.",poor
Can't repeat task at custom intervals,poor
It stopped showing reminders and notifications!!!!!,poor
"Uninstalled. I want a simple reminder app that will put a daily notification in my notification bar, every single day. Nothing else. No other features. But this is so bloated with features, it's impossible to know if it might do this or not.",poor
"Couldn't get the hang of it, I want something simple and cheaper to remind me of birthdays and dog to vets etc",poor
"Too annoying premium advertising, darkmode is premium only",poor
"The app was an okay task organizer at best, although it required internet and was ridden with adds and paywalls for a monthly ""premium"" subscription. Even if they asked for support, id prefer a one time payment of a higher amount like, $5 to unlock all features.",poor
Used to be good but now doesn't even notify me (and yes this is with the settings amended accordingly),poor
"Some of the sentences on my lists go off the screen, so we need an option to wrap the text when it reaches the right side of the screen. As of June 4, 2017, I can not sign on anymore using samsung galaxy after upgrading to Android 7.0 software. As of 6-19-2020, I never did get any.do to work on my Samsung galaxy s7, but it now works on my Samsung note 8.",poor
"You better don't rotate your phone from vertical to horizontal when typing new task, because it will be GONE. Any.Do support team said 2 years ago that it will be fixed, but it's still not. Also I have over 80 tasks and would love to see the search feature and ability to sort tasks by the date of their creation and by the alert date. The search was implemented but I don't know how to use it. Probably it works only on paid version.",poor
i liked it because of plan a tree cz i really needed it but it's expensive soo.. k bye,poor
The update is annoying. I want to add time on the list. But you just add time tag feature which make the time that i put not being displayed.,poor
LAGGIN! cannot open. Tq,poor
Recurring reminders are available for free in Google reminder. You can't Monetize the basic functions.,poor
For me it frequently stops syncing. I currently can't get it working again. But when it was working it was great.,poor
Doesnt work on windows,poor
not user friendly.,poor
Used to love this app. After the latest update its garbage! Can't turn off the automatic date/time thing that erases what you put in and sends it to that date or time. Will hang onto it for a bit in hopes that a new update will fix this issue. Or at least give the option to turn it off.,poor
"The website boasts that any.do is the best grocery list app for Android Wear. Lies. There is no way to view lists on Android Wear, only add tasks. You can view lists on Apple Watch. This is the feature I need and I guess I'll look elsewhere.",poor
"Reminder does not pop up on time or in some cases, does not pop up at all",poor
I love using this app however when I installed it to one of my phones I cannot login to it. It just keeps closing. I don't know what's wrong. Also I wish the widget would contain date and time of the tasks not just tick marks.,poor
"Not the bloody annoying calendar/task widget thing again. You did this once before. I don't want to use your calendar, just the task list so please bring back the option of a widget without the calendar option written at the top. Will use an alternative until I see AnyDo has been updated.",poor
"Paywall, even for dark theme. Very disappointed",poor
Not yet solved. Cannot log in,poor
"I need this app to share tasks real time with my significant other. Unfortunately, when she is adding tasks from iOS, sometimes they do no show up for me. Switching to Microsoft To Do and no problems. Additionally, being able to paste multiple cells from Excel makes MS offering indispensable, something I would sorely miss if I returned to Any.do.",poor
useless,poor
It can't adjust tasks with real-time line.,poor
I actually love this and have use this for a year but the new update is no good at all that I need to edit my review due to the changes...,poor
"In a word: clunky. I like the calendar integration, however everything else is basic and clunky. Simply adding a task to a list takes 3 clicks and you CANNOT SET A DATE, TIME, SUBTASKS, OR NOTES UNLESS YOU EXIT OUT OF THE TASK AND GOING BACK TO YOUR LIST. The app is designed to give you as many notifications as it can and constantly advertise the premium version. And whatever you do, DO NOT SIGN UP FOR A FREE TRIAL UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO SPEND AN HOUR SEARCHING FOR HOW TO DO SO.",poor
"Whuup, sorry, need to pay for unlimited daily task. Nope",poor
"Buggy interface. The grocery list feature is fine but the schedule is terrible. It kept changing event details after I saved. I had to go back in and turn off alarms for previously saved events (that I had alarms off). And it would NOT let me create an all day event that was only scheduled one day. No matter how many times I changed the dates it kept including the day before in my ""all day"" event. And then when I would try to edit it, it would change completely to two days before. What a mess.",poor
Free version is very limited compared to Ticktick and Microsoft To Do.,poor
"I've enjoyed using this app since I got it two weeks ago until recently, when it began crashing when I'd add tasks.",poor
"The grocery list is not syncing properly and is missing items that my wife added on her phone. This has caused issues for us where I've missed items when shopping. This is particularly bad considering the current quarantine and the fact that I have to queue up to get into the shop in the first place. I've tested and when I add the item ""snacks"" on my wife's phone they don't appear on my grocery list. I can not recommend this app currently because of this.",poor
I mean the app started seeming really nice and has a lot of work put into it but here me out if your looking for a app that is free and dont want to spend $ for daily reminders this is not it but if you dont mind paying like 7 $ this your app and with that 7 dollars you can get cool extra stuff,poor
a mess of features that don't serve me; cumbersome UX,poor
"When I saw that Dark Theme was premium only I stopped and uninstalled immediately. Frankly I was insulted. Are you hoping to squint me into submission? If I can't try your app comfortably then why bother? There are identical apps (I'm exploring now) that you're competing with, so think about making the app comfortable to use for free with restrictions I would pay to lift. It's like... youtube giving volume control only to premium members or test driving a new car without getting to use A/C.",poor
I have cancelled my subscription. An amount of Rs. 909.90 has been deducted from my account. Kindly refund the same. I'm not interested in the app,poor
"This app always put the things I haven't done to the next day. I don't like this. It should be stay at there if I didn't finished the work nor help me move to the next day and ask me to do it! If I didn't finished it, I'll continue the work tomorrow. I don't need you to help me move the task to the next day. It's annoying",poor
"Lost another star for your reply to my previous comment. I like the ""moment"" notification. I like planning my day.. i hate the dumb sounds I can't turn off for every item I snooze.",poor
"I'm sure the app is great seeing all the positive reviews not had earned. But having dark mode being ba premium feature is a deal breaker for me, because I would like to extensively test a product before considering a premium subscription but I can't get to use an app that forces light mode why all of my other apps are dark",poor
Not free,poor
"You can' t manage it easily per day, the interface is not clear when i click on a day I want to say only that day agenda not others around it. When i add a task it doesn t show me in which day is added - i have at least ten ideas to improve. They contact me, i will uninstall it for now. I submitted few complaints but there are more",poor
Important features locked behind a pay wall.,poor
A suspicious app! Do not recommend this application.,poor
"Poor widget options, which is what I needed most. Very space inefficient and not customizable at all. Disappointing. Todoist had the most compact and useful widget, followed by Microsoft ToDo.",poor
Keep losing mini steps after I write them down.,poor
"Thought it be a great replacement for GTasks. Main issue with Tasks is lack of pc app. I like the any.do widget as it has a transparent option. I use recurring tasks a lot. A routine which can be ticked and on the next day they'll reappear, which I found seemeles in the Google app. Unfortunately in any.do you need to set a reminder for each task with exact time, they don't stack on each other, creating a long list of notifications in the morning. Also no visual event line in calendar month view.",poor
Estou tendo dificuldades com alguns bugs..,poor
There is a issue with Notes. For as long as I can remeber you sometimes add a note and it's gone later. I keep having to go out and come back each time I add one in hope it's saved.,poor
I like the app but the fact that there are lots of other apps that can do the same thing ... it's imo ridiculous to charge a monthly fee.. they justify it by saying it's a service blabla it's an to do app. More people would actually pay for it if it wouldn't be a subscription model.,poor
"Doesn't show empty hours like Gcalender, also asking me to subscribe from the get go.",poor
"We dont use it. Like at all. Its not that different from your regular phone calendar. I'd actually like a refund, didn't even realize I was charged.",poor
Nice polished but useless. There is no filter for tags. Web and app synch problems happens missing tasks. Not any scoring system. May good for amateurs but not for project managers. However I like the calendar view.,poor
There are certain things I love like the fact that it sorts my grocery list by aisle automatically. But overall this app stresses me out. I just want an app that allows me to share my grocery list. But the grocery list seems buried in an area that isn't intuitive. I don't need something to schedule every second of my life which seems to be more this apps aim.,poor
You reaaallllyyy don't have a lot without paying,poor
Can't add more than 5 task to calendar without monthly fee.,poor
"The design is nice but it doesn't understand when I said 'later'. When I said remind me tomorrow morning, it replied okay I'll be reminded tomorrow at 16:00+. That's afternoon. I'll be very well roasted by my boss by then. Can't find any help on these issues. Was close to confirming my subscription. Sad ☹️",poor
Premium version only,poor
"Is there no way to assign a specific color to an event? I like to group my meetings by color. If I can't do that, the app isn't useful for me.",poor
"Trying to set a reoccuring event changes the date to one day before what I set it as. Trying to change the date back just creates a second event. Then trying to delete both events takes several tries, because half the time they don't actually delete. This is really annoying.",poor
Weak and underdeveloped platform. Don't expect support to treat you like a person - this is a company that just wants your money and then to forget about you.,poor
"Recurring tasks are very glitchy - they sometimes change the day or time when they recur. Per any.do's request i sent them a video of this happening... crickets. No explanation or acknowledgement and no refund as i requested. Fine otherwise, but i rely on recurring items.",poor
Missing grocery list widget and quantity for grocery list items!!!,poor
It doesn't sync up with Google Tasks. Not worth the change. Zapier does not work for Android. Zapier only works if you pay the Premium fee plus it only gives the option to add new tasks and complete tasks when integrating with Google Tasks. It does not import current tasks previously created in Google Tasks. There is no way to transfer my 144 tasks from Google to Anydo. And I can't afford $72.00 right off the bat to do it.,poor
"NEW: Great concept but NOT for confidential data because it's not encrypted (nor PW protected on phone or PC) and, one day, Any.Do company will get hacked & ALL your stuff be be out there, like EquiFax. RESOLVED: App loses your work. eg: I created a new task, started a ""notes"" section, pasted it in some material and clicked save. Then I went to another app to get more material but when I returned to any.do, my notes were GONE!. Your ""save"" button is fraudulent if it does not save when clicked!",poor
Nested can be improved,poor
It's a fine app but logs me out every other time I go to use it.,poor
"Hi Developer. Need to improve note module. It fix only for protrait view, which is when I'm using landscape view (tablet with keyboard), I need to adjust my head or the gadget. TQ",poor
Recurring tasks are behind a pay wall. Ridiculous to have to pay a monthly subscription for such a simple feature App is a little ugly and not customisable.,poor
Themes and location based reminders are under subscription. Both are free on most of apps like this. Thanks but no. I'll pass and keep using Google keep,poor
Not so great. The user interface is not friendly. Making the to do list takes far too long and theres no way (that i found) to make a list that repeats daily. I'll just stick to google keep.,poor
Strange thing. When I mark recurrent tasks as done in web desktop version into the Upcoming section.,poor
Notification is now pathetic.. shame. I liked it a lot. I think its time to jump ship. It's been fun.,poor
After all this time you still can not search tasks on Android. So you have to look through every task you have created and through each list to find what task you are looking for. Going down to 2 star.,poor
Not free,poor
"muito limitador pra quem não paga pra usa, e nem é tão vom assim.",poor
"It used to be a slick, minimal app that did what it needed to. Then they kept adding layers of unneeded features and forced people to make an account just to use it. No thanks.",poor
"Слишком сложно, но при этом нет того, что нужно. Очень много возможностей, но не смог элементарно сделать TODO список на _каждый_ день. И постоянно лезут с предложением купить премиум. Да не вопрос, если бы был необходимый функционал. Ощущение, что приложение разработано рубить бабло, но при этом не задумываясь о потребностях пользователя.",poor
No monthly recurring reminder features. Can't even remind me when to pay the bills!,poor
Have to create an account just to check out functionality. Don't want to do that. Uninstalling.,poor
How do i unsubscribe this useless app?,poor
"List feature sucks! I don't need to manage myself so I can't speak to that functionality. I just wanted a list app, preferably one that worked with Google Assistant. Although that feature works great, the list feature kind of sucks. In an attempt to look new and edgy, the user experience went down the drain. I found it clunky & irritating. I shouldn't have to add a new item to the grocery list just to be able to uncheck items I need again. And that's just one of many irritations. AnyList baby!",poor
Update: Used to be great. Now they've added so many steps it's no longer the simple app it used to be. Very disappointed.,poor
"I can t select weekly days which days i need remainder, and this drawback of app, best to go with other app",poor
Uninstalled after latest update and it blocked all my lists until I set up an account. No thanks.,poor
"The ""not completed"" tasks do not carry over to the next day automatically. I wanted an app that would constantly flash incomplete tasks in my home screen. Otherwise, presentation of the app is good.",poor
"Very average app, not intuitive . Will probably spend more time trying to plan than doing",poor
I dont liek it rlly,poor
Premium version is too much expensive. Any.do should provide an option in which we can select max. 3 to 5 apps for integration in premium version & pay accordingly.,poor
"Looks really good but... I'm not going to pay a subscription for it, sorry. If you said one off payment then maybe. Most of the locked features are available in other products out there.",poor
Well designed and all however alot of the crutial features are locked behind the premium which u need to pay for,poor
Unable to edit time for reminder. S7,poor
Cant really set custom remindere. For example I need to be able to check a specific system every 3 hours with other variables.. Cant do it,poor
"Could have been a good free app. Nice design , good ideas but the free version keeps forgetting the task alarm I configured. I put it at 6 but it resets it at 9. Don't know about the paid one.",poor
"Hi there, i would like to know if this application is for free or do i need to pay for it? Thank you for your answer.",poor
"Day 2 of trialling this. So far I've had two location reminders fail, I can't label a location with more than one letter, the only time based reminder that's fired did so while on a phone call so I don't know what it sounds like, not that I can change the sound anyway because the instructions don't work. I had no idea what the buttons meant so the first one tapped the task got snoozed for 28 hours. How is that a typical snooze length? Adding anything more than a basic list item is not intuitive",poor
I want to discontinue and it was monthly base they charge me yearly it's very sad pls help and refund,poor
"It sorely needs and UNDO (& backup/restore/revert) feature in case we accidentally touch/swipe a circle/bullet which then gets unintentionally deleted immediately (which I find incredibly frustrating). (It also needs a flexible feature to import & export other common text/data formats like CSV, XML, events to & from calendar… not just copy reminders to tasks) If Google fixes all that then I'd give it 5-stars!",poor
"I love this app, but recently the app keeps crashing everytime I enter. Plus the calendar is completely wrong. 😕",poor
No dark theme without a premium subscription? Ok,poor
"It's very simple, and it's interface is so beautiful. Why did I put 2 stars then? Because most of it features are limited to the paid edition, even the important ones.",poor
Looks like a copy of an IPhone app. Im not impressed by the huge bar in the bottom or the single colored ui. A night mode should come standard,poor
There is no sound,poor
"Too much spam. Stuff that I don't care for pops up on my screen all the time and blocking those also blocked the reminders I wanted the app for. Also, too many emails. I don't want more clutter to ""organize"" my life.",poor
Very productive,poor
I dont like how it charged me automatically after the free trial without informing me expiry of trial or if i wanted to subscribe to the paid service,poor
Not a great user interface. Have been using for almost 2 months but still struggling,poor
Hate subscription uninstalled,poor
Does this app work without internet connection also?,poor
gaada waktu kapan harus selesai.. jadi kurang detail,poor
Over all good task manager. But I do not like misleading and untrue boasts about integration with MS outlook. It is possible but only via zappier plus functionality is limited. Not possible to sync task between this 2apps.,poor
"Sharing didn't work, there's a permanent notification and everything is premium option, even the theme!",poor
"I was willing to give this a try to see if it suits my needs. Seemed ok, with limited use so far. The only thing more annoying than constant notifications from apps is at 9am when my phone vibrates and Any.Do takes over the whole screen and asks me to plan my day. I don't need it taking over things, i will plan when i want. Are you seriously doing this? It is the equivalent of a browser popup and very annoying.",poor
"Syncing with Alexa takes over 10-15 minutes which renders it unusable. Any.do, before you post your generic response: yes, I added the skill to my Alexa and, yes, I logged into my accounts. It syncs... kind of... so I can verify the two accounts are talking... just not well at all. When I use Wunderlist or Google Tasks or just Alexa by itself, the changes are instantly viewable across all platforms. The only reason I downloaded with app was to give me more control over my Alexa lists (which for some insane reason you cannot reorder). The extremely lag in syncing Any.do with Alexa renders this app useless. The UI looks really nice and user friendly, so I bumped it up to 2 stars.",poor
"I don't care for it, when I first opened it it showed me all these appointments. I was thinking what the heck then I figured out it was showing me weeks passed along with the current. To me that's just a bunch of clutter. Then it was telling me I had five appointments this month, no, only have one, it only showed the one but it still says 5. I don't have a clue what the other four are. Anytime I try to do anyting it practically begged me to join premium, I just uninstalled it.",poor
Good until it started wanting money for doing its job,poor
"Pretty with nice add ons and integrations but more than once I've gone back to a long list I created to find it gone or reverted back to a very old version, so annoying. Don't need the song and dance this app offers if it can't save a basic list",poor
"I was about to jump wholeheartedly into using this app (its integration with Google Calendar being exactly what I'm looking for) but now I see that it has no search feature on Android. Worse still, Android Search has been on their roadmap since 2015 and it's still not done. 2015!?! In the meantime other apps can build smart lists it out of tags, status and free text. Seriously behind the curve, guys.",poor
"Wear OS app only supports adding tasks, not viewing existing ones (without reminders)",poor
"I tried it years ago and never really got it going. Then I switched to Wunderlist and became an organized machine! Now Wunderlist is being retired, so I thought I'd try again, guessing it would be much better by now and that my ability to use it to my advantage would be vastly improved. Nope. No ability for folders or some other way to group lists together so I don't have to flip through all my lists to find the one I want. Not even a list view to make them easier to find.",poor
Downloads the app but package file is invalid error pops up before completing installation,poor
"It's very confusing. I got the calendar app that was suggested to me when I wanted to use the widget, but once I started using the calendar along with any.do the tasks notifications got duplicated. I don't see the point of having any.do when the calendar app does the same thing.",poor
So far so good... bit expensive having to purchase a yearly basis to access basic functions as color tags and what comes with it. Translation to Greek is not fluent for the price tag / annually I would apprechiate developers look closer at them. Will give it a try before committing on purchasing it per year. On a positive note love the widget (using however nova launcher). Current rating will change based on the experience.,poor
"Ah yes, wanna use an ""advanced"" calendar? Well, turns out you must have an account for that. What's that, your eyes are burning under this bright theme? Well we have a solution just for you! As you have seen in our tips, you can change the theme. Oh W O P S, NO YOU CAN'T, how silly of us to not tell you in tips that ~BUY OUR PREMIUM!!!~... //Maybe it's just not what I was looking for...",poor
"Too whacked for creating lists, like grocery or to do with their tasks and subtasks instead of just lists you can check complete",poor
"I'm a student and was looking for something get myself very organized. I have tried series of productivity apps before. Apparently this had one of the features i have always been looking for; integration with other apps which I love. Two things I found disappointing, features are extremely limited without premium, it's almost impossible to use like that also very expensive. I couldn't find statistics; from totally hours and other reports",poor
There should be a dark mode instead of setting through a premium theme option,poor
"I liked using this app but I recently noticed that important information I had saved in sub tasks has all been deleted. Its happened before and I thought I had made a mistake. But no, it's just this app malfunctioning.",poor
Many times I've put sub tasks on my to-do tasks and they just disappear for some reason. I've forgotten many things because of this and still hasn't been fixed despite various updates.,poor
App not bad but very limited unless you pay. Downloaded this app after reading in the news about it's WhatsApp integration. That is only available if you pay. Without the paid for aspects this application is like any other generic calender app.,poor
"I am a paid user of this app. I like this app a lot, until Android 10. They claim what they used to do is not possible but that is not true because another app I use (Daylio) has a nice notification that jumps out at you, like Any.do used to. Now Any.do gives a regular ignorable notification which you click and the app does something on the screen and is pretty pathetic, THEN it gives it's notification to plan your day. So it's two clicks with a big visual pause in between. Not cool. 👎",poor
"I dont like that it requires you to login, why cant I just use it without logging in my accounts",poor
Questionable experience. Upgraded to premium but WhatsApp integration is not working. Seems a little confusing.,poor
Zero features in free version.,poor
"good shared tasks, but app itself makes me angry.. it keeps forgetting i am logged in with my google account.. so I need to login for like each two weeks or so.. and it also forgets my settings... Edit: unfortunately this has not been fixed yet, even though I had sent logs and communicated with you. Decreasing my rating.",poor
I can not figure out how to get it on my galaxy watch...ugh.,poor
"when you switch the language, you get wierd bug that your app is half in English half in selected language",poor
I was given this premium app. Now with new versions is not updating. I fail to understand this. If I'm given premium version then now why wouldn't it get updated? If it was non upgradable then why was it given? It's a great app and so it hurts when there are such tricks used on customers.,poor
"Dec. 5, 2019 Update Moved from 5 stars to 2 for the reason below: I've had this app for about half a decade. The last couple years have been irritating. I add sub tasks. When I go back to the tasks, the sub tasks aren't there. I wish there was a save button as a cue and confirmion that the subtasks are saved. Not sure how long I could forgive the app until I just use another one altogether. Please address subtasks staying in the next update. Thanks! Was 5 stars for the longest time Awesome!",poor
"Useful as a to-do list. Sets a real annoying ""plan your day"" popup reminder every morning. How you disable it is non obvious. Uninstalled.",poor
"Can't clean up old Alexa lists! We use this purely for the Alexa shopping list integration. However, early on it was very buggy, so we had to relink our Alexa account a number of times. And now we have like 4 or 5 old ""Alexa shopping list""s that we cannot delete! ""Alexa lists can not be modified with Any.do. You can do it from the Alexa app""... No, I can not, because it only deletes the working one!",poor
Reminder feature is not working 🥱,poor
"Allowed all the permissions for this app but i still can't get the reminder to work on my smartphone running Android 8. Downloaded a different reminder app and also allowed all permissions for it, and it worked well.",poor
I had made an account for this app a long time ago but didn't use it for long and I forgot why until I re-downloaded it today. This is one of those apps that's incredibly frustrating because a lot of the main advertised features are behind a pay wall and/or you have to make an ADDITIONAL ACCOUNT FOR. Paying more than $1/mo for a list app is ridiculous. If anything it should be a one-time purchase.,poor
I used to love it. It was my go to app for many years. But over the time it is losing the special status. It doesn't have travel time anymore which was the main reason why i could stay on top of things without mentally having to calculate each meeting and setting the times. They removed that!,poor
"The alarm feature does not work, which leads to missing the tasks.",poor
"Nice looking UI, but inability to disable popups is a deal breaker for me. Uninstalled.",poor
"This still works pretty well, but I'm not a fan of the updated widget not listing tasks chronologically.",neutral
Good app. Annoying pop up every morning on my phone even though I have the notification turned off.,neutral
I haven't used they made an effort from there side. I'm a bit of a mess and I need time.,neutral

I have real memory difficulties and need an app that actually works properly! Disappointing, as I find the one off reminders really helpful.",neutral

"Started out strong... First few days perfect, synced to smart watch and woke with everything planned. But now it's not sending the notifications regularly - not to watch or android phone. Added it to the PC and tried the phone widget - maybe that broke it. Weird pile of repeated completed daily tasks with no time set, while the daily tasks with times don't notify. Some work then don't - very frustrating. Clearing the cache/reinstall didn't work. Feels like a battle to get it to function. :/",neutral
Features are all right. It doesn't seem to me like they actually USE their own product. Else the idiosyncrasies would have been ironed out.,neutral

"Now able to see list view from widget thanks to developer response - but there's a new bigger problem now. The integration with Google Assistant is going terribly.

It was awesome at first. Then I try to add an event from the widget and it won't do it correctly. Super frustrated,neutral
"Nuisance app. It probably works fine, but it's definitely not for me. However, when I decided to uninstall it, it gave me no easy way to delete my account. To delete my account I need to enter a password. I never set a password because I signed up with Google. So I have to login to create a password just to enter password to delete the account. I haven't figured out how to revoke the permissions I gave. This is abusive. Deleting an account and data should be straightforward.",neutral
"Love this app, but some functions make the productivity lacking. In my experience, there is a limited amount of notifications I can receive from this app per day. There appears to be no way to change this on the settings for my phone or the app. This is problematic for me, because I have the premium version and have it connected to Zapier.

What happened to the missed calls notification? I recently switched phones and had to download the new version and the option is no longer there. It was one of the main reasons I used the app.,neutral
"To be fair, I downloaded it and uninstalled it after a couple of minutes. The reason for this is that I hate apps that scream ""pay me money"" since the instance you download it, and this one did that exactly. With the ""free premium trial"" being in your face all the time, and then setting it up or going through the tutorial you could see all the features and all you could see is ""premium"". Just do the app as a paid one instead of begging for people to pay for it. It looks amazing though.",neutral

"Extremely aggressive in pushing the premium and paid version. Also overly complex since as its name denotes, it tries to do everything or anything.

But they updated and fixed what wasn't broken. Now, all uncompleted tasks show in the task window with no delineation of whether they are recent, scheduled, or past due. Visually, it is very confusing. I'm probably going to dump this app. I would like a good calendar view of things scheduled on each day and it doesn't have that.",neutral

I left a review earlier that was one star. While the app wasn't for me (I found that it was confusing and didn't suit my needs so I deleted it shortly after) The customer service was fantastic. I was charged for a subscription even though I didn't use the app because I made a mistake in canceling the subscription. I sent an email detailing my problem and asking for a refund. The response was quick and a refund was granted I thought it was only fair to come back and leave a nicer review.,neutral

Reminders for things I have set daily don't even come up anymore, but it remembers to give me an display-over-app notification to remind me to set a reminder.

1) It has a calendar feature but you can't customize the calendar events repetition as much as you can in google (can do daily but not 5 days a week all in one entry). 2) edit: figured the task sorting part out. Sort by time and collapse upcoming/tomorrow and it will just show your daily tasks. I like that. But it's still not worth paying for unless the calendar event customization is as good as Google's since that is free.,good

Great app. but buggy. Keeps asking me to delete all completed tasks even though it's empty,good
Good,good
nice,good
Initial upgrade hid the separation of today tomorrow upcoming and someday. After sorting and adding new tasks all of sudden they all showed up again. Don't know why this happened. If these features go away it will make this app much harder to use. The bug freaked me out and cause me to write a very bad review which I have since edited and amended,good

"I've used this app for many years with good experience. Lately the UX and complexity have caused some problems, nonetheless, new features have been very good.

It's just gone with no possibility to configure it again. I do understand development of new features, but I do not appreciate removal of features that are being used. Great app, not for me anymore",good
還算不錯用！簡單易操作,good
"It's good app but the calendar view doesn't highlight the day you're on. It's gray like the other days and makes it hard to quicly scroll to today's events.

When trying to set the time for a reminder, the clock's 5 minutes faster and automatically blocks the other minutes before. As an alternative, I set the date and time using natural language but sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Kindly fix this. Once again, it's a wonderful application.",good

"I love Any. but got a few things I don't like. For some reason events cannot be colored when they are written directly to Any.do as it happens on Google Calendar and Zapier doesn't give you that option. I have to write the event in Google Calendar, put the color I want to see it in Any.do. It would be great if you could enable that option. Other idea please put a Report option of things done in the day and task completed. Thanks",good
Hh,good
Good,good
This rating is for the free version. Most feature rich free version I've tried of other to do list type apps. Interface takes some getting used to but great features and everything seems to be working.,good
It would be better if there's an icon beside the task so I can easily identify whether a task has some note to it.,good
"The app keeps getting back to system language even after I selected a different one countless times. I've to select the system language and then select (again) the language I want the app to be with, only for it to go back after a while",good
So great. I have suggested this app to many a friend. Suggestion: have the ability to custom the repeat feature in the events. Sometimes things repeat every week but only for 5 weeks.,good
"Muy buena app, funciona bien y es muy simple e intuitiva. El único pero que le puedo poner es que cuando mando a mis compañeros de trabajo algún quehacer, no siempre llega la notificación",good
It's good app for all,good
I love it so far.,good
Great,good
I am using it daily,good
"Suggestions: - Make the tag colors the background of the task, and not just a small line under the task title. At least have this as an option. - The trees in the Focus mode are all the same no matter how quick or long you do a task. Add variety to this mode: trees/plants to choose from, other decorations, probably even animals or different landscapes. Add more music to choose from, too. I definitely love the look and feel of this app. I enjoy it better with Premium, though.",good
"Good design, features..",good
I really enjoy using the app but I want to suggest a daily summary of tasks to be done (in the morning) and tasks completed and those that were not. Thanks for your hard work.,good
I dont like that ths deleted or finished every day just let the incomplete ones roll over and the completed ones stay back,good
"There's a bug where I set a reminder on Saturday weekly then after I saved it, it shows Friday on the screen.",good
It is very nice app. It would be good if you could add due date option for tasks,good
A good app to remind me of things I need to do,good
Gr8,good
Excited,good
Very useful,good
Make dark theme available in the free app,good
Can I import my task list from Google keep app,good
Good,good
It would be better if there was a voice command like Alexa.,good
Thanks for the support. Battery optimiser on Xiaomi disables the autostart of the app. It works now,good
Has been super helpful in organising my days. Has made getting my chores sorted so easy,good
So far so good,good
Good,good
Nice App. Able to manage my tasks,good
I like this app. It helps me to accomplish my tasks very comfortably. A must have apps for productivity. Thank you,good
Decent app,good
It helps me to remember what to do as I forget sometimes. It's a nice application but there would be a slight change in it. There must be a ringtone to remember not any message. As people see calls not messages as my opinion.,good
"This app is brilliantly developed with all necessary features. But few things disappoints us. We cannot set sound notification, it pop-ups only if we are using mobile. Sometimes it doesn't remind us the scheduled activity even in notification. If these bugs are fixed I'll definitely go for paid version with five rating.",good
Getting better with each up date.,good
App parfaite si vous voulez vous tenir à jour et savoir où vous en êtes avec vos tâches/missions. versions gratuite avec quelques publicités mais rien de vraiment méchant. A tester absolument !,good
Love it,good
Super,good
Any.Do moment new colored style isn't good.,good
This app was great a year or two ago. They spam you now with premium service purchase requests (which are costly) and have restricted all the good options to their premium service.,good
Help you alot to plan your day,good
Great app. I really like the integration with other apps like Gmail and Trello etc. My only problem is it sometimes doesn't show notifications.,good
Good app,good
It's great,good
TonyR.Suarez penaurree,good
Good,good
Amazing app pretty good to remember you what you should do :3,good
Nice,good
Interesting but personally not needed.,good
Good app but eventually stopped using it as it didn't fit my needs exactly.,good
Ol,good
"I'm trying to use this a family organiser and so far so good. The only feature I'd really like is to share reminders - is that possible? E.g. if I set a task in a shared list, I'd like everyone to receive a reminder for that task (or at least the person who has been assigned). As it stands, you can only set up reminders for yourself.",good
"If it wasn't for the fact that the app doesn't offer separate widgets for Work Profile (I personally really need this), I'd give it 5 stars :)",good
Will be happy if this app comes with time duration..other that this is a perfect app with which one can easily create tasks,good
"I love the app, 8have been usinfg it for quit a while now, the only thing I font like is that it only has a list option, though I wish to make a morning routine on it, please see this and fix it, thank you!",good
It has been very useful for me.,good
Its great for quick reminders with events just weird its 30 min before by default i wanna change that alsoo every 3 and 6 months reminder be USEFUL and a must pls like toothbrush replace reminder.,good
Adding Habit Tracker would be useful.,good
"Love the app, but frequent changes to the UX are frustrating. I manage to get used to changes, develop some muscle memory, and more changes come. The new snoozing experience is very slow! It may be flashy, but it's just painfully slow, it's an added inconvenience. Please at least make it an opt-in feature.",good
"This is my favorite to-do type of app, it's gorgeous on an oled display, but I really wish there were a better way to set up repeatable checklists. To start a good habit I find the reminder to do it everyday very helpfyl, but even better is tracking how many times I actually did after a week and when. This app allows repeat events with notifications but doesn't track time completed or show completed or incomplete events on Cal or Google calendar so making schedule adjustments is a chore.",good
Easy to use interface... Premium account links into other APPS,good
"Relocate the *Delete Task* & *Mark as Done* tabs. I have a Galaxy Note 10+, and, quite likely w/ other phones, when i motion to press my *navigation button* on the bottom right or the *open application button*, on the bottom left, i am frequently accidentally tapping the *mark as done* or *delete task* tabs and have to to manage or recreate my my task details that I was already working with. Aside from being increasingly frustrating, aggravating, and annoying, this becomes a time waster.",good
"Honestly, needs a lot more features for me to be worth paying premium for (I tried out the free trial). The deal breaker for me was the fact that I can't set custom alerts for calender events.. maximum I can do is 2 days before event.. why can't I customize it (i.e 2 weeks or 10 days)? Then they need other things like automatic dark theme switching. Other than that, it's a nice productivity app. Love that it combines tasks and events into the calendar",good
Nearly perfect for daily usage. Is there a way for widget do display tasks hours I think this would be massive help for the users?,good
"Clean, simple interface. Generally fast and easy to add things as I think of them. However.....I wish the app didn't think it was so smart. I find the auto-spelling annoying. Putting in 8-10 ft. electric cord under lists was automatically interpreted as August 10th. And the assumptions about categories for shopping lists is annoying. 5 different things to get a hardware store end up in 4 different categories. Changing the categories for shopping lists is not easy to manage (and why do they show up under Tasks at all?)",good
"A perfect app to prioritize daily tasks, yet the U.I is still not up to mark.",good
99% percent love this app! I would like the option to turn off the vibration that occurs when moving a task from one sublist to another. It's annoying to other people nearby when I'm using it in a quiet place which stops me from using it at certain times of my day. Otherwise fulfills all of my to do list and note taking needs.,good
"Great tool. I use it every day. There's a bug, however, that's very annoying. I'm on Galaxy Note 9. When I move the items, there's 80% chance the item will loose previously assigned datetime and will be moved to the Someday list. It's very annoying and time consuming! This is the sorting mode by Time. Additionally, when I choose this mode, majority of items belonging to various lists, unfortunately, will not be sorted by date & time, so I'd have to move them manually... Please fix these issues",good
Nice app foe reminder,good
"Great app, very usable, lots of features...but 36$ a year for premium? That's almost as much as I pay for my premium password manager, and that's much more complicated and costly to develop and maintain. This is a GREAT app, but there's no way I'm going to pay that much.",good
Nice app very useful,good
Nice,good
"Easy to use and very straightforward, no fuss just works perfectly with timely reminders.",good
Helpful app. Thanks for the good work.,good
"Any.do is gradually becoming my daily tool for managing my schedule, tracking customer debt position. It is a rewarding experience for d money.",good
"I reinstalled 5 times but is'nt working basically It is'nt singing with any of 3 methods. Plese fix It, I am unable to use such a good application.",good
The app lacks tools to view how good I am keeping up with my daily habit/recurring tasks.,good
"Very good planning organizer, but there's still few bugs here and there. In the grocery list, why i can't open the completed lists? It's always close again after 1 second. Please fix.",good
Very nice,good
Great app but needs work.,good
"Best wunderlist replacement with one major flaw. As far as a to-do list app it is pretty decent and has what you would want. It is very tricky to figure out how to disable all of the random notifications this app sends you. That is my major complaint, but once you finally get it all disabled this app is decent. The layout is a little messy, but the smart grocery grouping is nice.",good
"This app is great , I mean really it is.. you can do a lot of things but only if you pay which isn't a bad thing , it's just that as a student adding this to my expenses is just not feasible ... Hence the 4 stars , connecting to a student service such as UniDays would increase influx of student users.",good
Goood,good
Good,good
There's no search option for mobile version even I already have the latest version,good
So far so good. I just dont like the fact that it has payment to get full features and it's quite expensive.,good
Great,good
Great app for tracking tasks. Could use some work on gesture/finger detection. For example I will always accidentally close the text field for a new note when trying to hit save. Pro version is good but a little pricy for the benefits.,good
Its a very good app...the only issue thats what i am facing is the reminder thing..it dont used to send me reminders and it only notify me when the app is opened. However i have already given all the notification rights. Dear any.do team kindly look in to the matter or advise me if i have missed something with respect to notification settings. Thanks,good
Good note,good
"It is great, but it would be better if the sort by Time feature is really sort it by Time. Not only today, tomorrow, and upcoming. It is really inconvenient if in the Upcoming tasks, it is not sort by time.",good
So far this is the best app I have used to plan for my hw and studiesas it is very easy to set and plan the things you want .I highly recommend you to try this app.,good
"It suddenly quit syncing. I've tried logging off and back on again with no luck. When I try to do it manually it just already says that it was synced ""just now""...even though none of the things I have added show up. Never had this problem before. If I can't get it resolved I will remove app and find something different. Very frustrating. Update: I did a FORCE STOP on the app, and it seems to be back to normal. It works for what I need (shopping list) but isn't the easiest for rearranging the list, and the advertisement at the bottom of the list is very annoying and makes rearranging the list even more difficult.",good
This app really help me.😊,good
How to disable the everyday 9am reminder to keep a reminder? Honestly don't need it. That's just a noise!,good
No pop-up reminders because we use planner as we forget.,good
"The grocery lists don't work on Huawei P30 Pro after your last update. The different list sections fold and unfold by themselves. It became impossible to use them. Fix it and I'll give you 5 stars again. Thanks for the follow up, I edit the review to 4 stars by now for the good customer service. Waiting for the big to be fixed!",good
"Increase my productivity, helps me to remind, and also the price for premium version is also very less.",good
It helped me,good
"I LOVE this app. It was the one I narrowed down to after having downloaded several to-do apps. HOWEVER, I wish it had just a plain note taking feature for day to day things to remember, without it being attached to a to-do item. I also wish the interface was slightly easier to manage, there are a couple fixes that would increase the apps ability to be intuitive for the user. (An easier way to undo checking off a list item, being able to view the agendas differently ie calendar and tasks)",good
Love this app.. But I wish i can add due date for my task.,good
Très pratique !,good
"Are the tasks created in this apo visible in Google calendar? If yes, how to set that up?",good
Very good app for manage the things. Easy to use.,good
I can hardly give up on this app. It is so intuitive even though there are still things to improve. 1-Shortcut to grocery list 2-Displaying time of the task in the widget,good
Its good and does the job,good
I started with the subscription primarily because of the NLP. Does it support recurring tasks with NLP ? The integrations are awsome!,good
"Great app for goal makers, but there are some premium features . Please make them free to use. It's a humble request.",good
Subscribe by hi iam vimal,good
Good,good
Had an issue but it was handled right away.,good
Great,good
Great App for planning my day,good
It's simply the best 😁 ❤️,good
"Missing one key feature that is a deal breaker for me. I MUST have the option to create recurring tasks based on date of completion. Ex: If I have a recurring task set up to complete every 10 days, but I actually go 15 days before completing it, I don't want to be reminded again in 5 days. I want the next due date to advance 10 days from whenever I last completed it. It's unfortunate because I love everything about this app, but won't subscribe to the paid version until this feature is added.",good
I just like this app for it's widget. I didn't pay for the full version so I uninstalled. I'm coming back because the widget look EXACTLY how I need it to look. I wish I could JUST install the widget honestly. It's my favorite.,good
Really useful and well designed app - only thing I feel that is missing to make it five stars is having a shopping list widget,good
Do i need to pay?,good
Great app! It makes my family and me do specific tasks. I would give it a 5 star review but sometimes the notification doesn't pop up at all.,good
Very good app but I am giving it 4 star because the priorities constantly delete every time I leave the app and suddenly reappear which is very very annoying,good
I m new to used,good
I think that a bug when I set tag for the goal they sometimes disappear,good
Nice,good
Timely,good
"Excellent to help get organized, to dos, lists...havent used all features yet but looking to learn and utilize. U",good
Simple and useful. Liked the widget too.,good
"Good app, simple, easy, beautiful design, bright colors, auto backup to cloud, sync with calendar, it has two subscribe plans, free account and premium.",good
Good,good
"The app felt good enough for me to buy the yearly subscription, which I did and paid th 15€ it requested. But a week later they charged me 17 more euros to my credit card for the same subscription and the same features so I basically paid 32€ . THAT is a scam and unless I get my 17€ euros back I'm gonna keep the rating at one star. Edit: issue was solved and I got a refund for the extra money that was charged, all's well that ends well.",good
"Would love to have been able to plan out a week and see it rather than having today, tomorrow, and upcoming. I use the calendar feature a lot, though and it is super useful",good
"This app is good. I use it daily and it runs my life. I have too many tasks though, and anydo's plan my day feature is good at forcing me to postpone stuff to next week, repeatedly. Pls add a built in optional Eisenhower matrix tagging system - tag each item with a quadrant label. Add a matrix view option to view all today's tasks in quadrant view, with filters for specific list only or all items. It's hard work retyping any do items into other apps to view like this",good
Very practical and usefull application,good
Nice app which reminds us our tasks and events,good
I like thid,good
Super,good
Good,good
Useful,good
Boo.,good
"This could be an awesome app. It has great potential except for a few flaws that end up making it a super irritating app. I have reported these issues to the app's tech support several times only to get lame responses with no resolutions. The latest being that when items are entered into a category in this app, the app for some reason resorts the sequence of items in my list automatically. I put these items in the list in a certain order for a reason. I have other issues, but no moreroomher",good
Helpful 😁,good
"Useful app, but with the latest update that incorporates language automatically into setting the time, it will delete times that are part of my reminder. For instance, if I want to say ""go to a meeting at 3:30"" it will delete the words ""at 3:30"" and set the remind to 3:30. So if I wanted my reminder to tell me what time the meeting was, I can't see it anymore. Too bad this option can't be turned off.",good
Can anyone explain 'any.do moment' and 'plan my day' option in the app??,good
UPDATE: Tags have started syncing back again. Tags do not sync between the mobile and desktop app. I am a premium user and I put in a ticket about the issue. After frequent back and forth over the email the issue hasn't been resolved yet. I will update my rating after the issue has been fixed.,good
"Integrates well with my work flow. I had difficulty in understanding the 'My Lists' so instead I ""listed"" My projects instead...works, now integrates well with what I do and the tags differentiates similar project ""lists"". I accidentally deleted my shopping list when I really wanted to remove some items...but its growing on me.",good
Is this a free app or have to subscribe (& pay) to use beyond 7 days?,good
Only one suggestion: an option for big tasks. Sometimes i have a big task that i will complete over multiple days and it would be cool to be able to check off a little bit at a time.,good
this is a good app,good
Great.. and i liked it more than todoist..,good
Best to do list apk I have ever used.,good
Alot of great features and cry informative and reminds you as well . Great for me thumbs 👍,good
"Another app that what's my info by having me sign in. EDIT: I rethought my 1 🌟 as I don't want to sync just use, doesn't mean the app isn't good.",good
Not always where it should be. does not always popup when set on samsung galaxy 9. very few aps rate 5 stars as very few have no problems at all. 5 stars woould say it works perfectly from my perspective.,good
It was perfect until the new update on Huawei P20 Lite. More precisely with the short cut (widget) on a main screen. Please sort this out. Thanks,good
I love this app Previous issue of being randomly logged out was resolved,good
Great app for managing your activities. Been using this for 3 years and it still meets my requirement in managing my to-do's,good
Great app. Love using daily,good
Feel good help me for rewind my task,good
A very good reminder app.,good
I love this app,good
"Please add option of grouping lists or creating sections into lists, so that we can have sub-lists. Rest it's good. Please make a note taking app also. You make amazing apps.",good
Good,good
I have never see such wonderful application before,good
"Good integration with Google home, but needs widget to be able to access the shopping list",good
"simplistic, easy and very useful Edit: Google voice demand beep cannot be muted?",good
good one..nit n clean ..liked it.,good
Plan my day should be free...,good
Sounds alittle hard and complicated to me Good app btw...,good
I was finally able to get this installed- yay! My husband also put it on his phone so we can share the grocery list and others. I've updated to 4 stars as it seems to be working now. Thanks! Can't get it to finish installing and I have plenty if room. Gets to 97% and then stops. I will revise my review if I ever get to try it!,good
This app is awesome. I am currently using the free version and it had everything I need. It truly makes it easy for you to stai organized and not lose tracks of priorities.,good
Great product,good
"Great app, helps me to plan my day ahead",good
"This app is amazing, changed my life. I'm doing 3x tasks daily since I installed the app, I can't be lazy. The pro version is expesive for a student in my country.",good
Good app 🙂👍,good
I like this app. It is the most simple and straight forward of its type that I've found.,good
Very good,good
Nice app Plzz start,good

"I started using this a week ago, it has already became a useful tool for being productive. Really recommend downloading",good
Good experiment.,good
Amazing and fantastic app❤️,good
Interesting,good
i like that app,good
Truly the best planning app! I was looking for a planning app with widgets that can change their size. Was harder than I thought! I love that you can see everythubg even in the smallest widget. That was very important to me. What I also like is that you can see all your tasks in a time line sorted by time. This way I don't miss anything. Subtasks and notes are helpful. I like the separate feature for the shopping list! This app is super flexible and intuitive!,good
মোবাইল নাম্বার সেটিং অ্যাপ,good
Love it! Has been super helpful in getting me more focused ans organized. Super easy to use and love the reminders!,good
It is exactly what I wanted....👌,good

Very nice,good
Excellent app. I like the design and it helps in making things done on time. The integration with many other apps has played major role in my daily life. I personally use the whatsapp integration feature. Thank you for the creativity.,good
Very Good,good
Best reminder ever,good
good apps,good
great and useful,good
I loved it.,good
Likes it very much,good
I began using this app 18months ago after having a baby and feeling that i was never feeling organised. It has been a game changer in helping me schedual all of the little things and keeping me on track,good
"What i love a most is integration with whatsapp, feels like have a private secretary.",good
Spr remainder,good
Very useful aap. I am satisfied,good
Thanks a lot for the reply! It's working great again like before!! 😄😄 (Small suggestion: maybe make this fact more obvious from the app UI or provide sort order as an option for the widget 😀) Thanks again!,good
It's awesome. I've tried some other apps but didn't find as much productive as it.,good
ok,good
"Truly amazing. One of the apps that I kept installing even after switching phones. Really helps me to organise my day better. LOVED the interface too, smooth and professional",good
Very useful app. Thanks to the developers!,good
Great To do App,good
Encourages me to do more!,good
Love this app. Used it for years!,good
Amazing app! Just one suggestion please please add feature of setting time in subtasks as well. It would be a really great feature making the app more wholesale!!,good
"Been using it for years and planning everything in this app - from work to home payments. As a premium user I really enjoy the lightning fast support, which solves the rare issue that might occur. Five stars!",good
This app is great! I'm able to use an online scheduling tool without having to pay for a subscription. Helps me stay on task at work.,good
This app gets better all the time. I'd be lost without it... And so easy to use!!,good
Awesome app the best,good
My personal secretary,good
Good,good
amazing,good
Very very helpful and easy to use as well. 'Must Have' app.👍👍,good
Write down something on your mind and come back to it later - life saver - store all my thoughts and important revelations in the app to be worked on later,good
New to it but I think it's going to make my life easier,good
Farhan Myao 💔,good
Superb 😍,good
"Use this app every day. The only problem is that when you place an item to do in a specific place on a specific day, the item jumps to the top of the day or to the bottom of the list by itself and you have to re-place it.",good
Nice app,good
"IT'S AMAZING,IT HELPS ME BE MORE ORGANISED",good
This is awesome,good
Helps very well with work.,good
Best app keep it up,good
I loving this app. It's make me a better people,good
"Started using this app in 2014. Still a great app. Of course, the paid version has more features but the basic version is quite useful.",good
Like this apps,good
Love this app it has everything I need and I now remember what I need to do,good
Very good app,good
"Very useful. I think it's best for a day-to-day use, but I'm particularly impressed with the grocery list function period really dig it! And it's really cool that it sinks with my calendar!",good
"Wonderful App !! Thanks, Any.Do Team.",good
"This app my 📱 phone number and used google account number and my all oldest play games with real money and Olympic tired my add all miss and hack accounts add loss money and my all 3 years use number usbGoogle Play Store activities add a""hithis list, not sear in this app use other people birdseed.",good

This has been invaluable for our work projects and is easy to use,good
This app is so perfect. I love how the widget works.,good
Becoming more efficient after I start using this app. No longer miss any task.,good

Nicely Arranged Everything,good
Love this app! My go to for organization,good
"Very useful in helping my work organized, Love it!!",good
Awesome trip organization,good
"Though I had a hard time learning this app at first because I don't know the buttons to tap, but it won't take you long learning that buttons! I can manage my tasks on school properly na!",good
I live it,good
Good,good
Forget everything and enjoy the life. Any.do will ensure you don't forget anything. It's really an excellent app to manage your everyday task so that you should not miss anything from your 'To Do' list. It's quite helpful in every day life. Thanks a lot.,good
Great to keep important things in front of me for a busy schedule. Love the option for when you can set each reminder for.,good
Cheap paid version... covers all u need to maintain a todo list,good
Good remind me to check,good
rathergood,good
Good,good
"Excellent customer service and very reasonable staff. They tried to reach me within a week, their responses were very clear and not once did they blame me for any issues I had run into. Overall, a great experience. The app itself is nice as a To-Do list or to organize your numerous tasks by due date, categories as well as location.",good
The 1st October update has an issue in widget. The repeated tasks remain on top despite you mark then done for today.,good
"I love this app, and I can't start my day without it, but lately with the new updates I got lost with my tasks list the feature of having today tomorrow and upcoming tasks had been gone which is not good at all. I stopped using the app actually I hope the management of this app will look into this issue and fix it otherwise I will need to look for another app",good
👍,good
Intuitive and motivating way of zooming through your task lists!,good
The best.Pop up reminder is useful as it constantly pops up at the specified time and you can't avoid it until you reset the time and date.This is useful.,good
Class,good
Best app I have found,good
"Good, and the most important thing: it's free to use and the basic feature is more than enough for me Been using this for 3 years+, keep it up!",good
"I love this app, it really helps me manage everything in my life.",good
Good app,good
Nice,good
Nice easy way to track tasks in different parts of your life.,good
It is absolutely the best tool,good
Excellent,good
"Only thing that could make this better and maybe I'm just too dumb to figure out, lol, how to make it work.is if as long as the apps open you could just talk into your phone and say like task/ event instead of having to stop and type it you know but that's my two cents I still love it thank you",good
Good,good
So far so good I just download this to help my husband be more organized.,good
"I like this app for the most part. Loads of different plugins however if you want to change the date for your reminder from the default date, it takes 7 taps! SEVEN! That is not great UX and needs to improve. I miss the Wunderlist style smart date adding. Update: The new smart date feature makes this a 5 star app for me!",good
"New navigation is far less convenient than the pre update there should be an option to revert it. Update: Thanks for listening, updated to 5 star for the reply",good
Good,good
Just do it,good
Great app,good
The best app ever...worth my money for subscribing.. Cause I'm a student and it's really help me to manage my day,good
"I adore this app. For an absent-minded-professor type like myself, having everything I need to stay on track and show up all together in one place that can be accessed across platforms is an absolute lifesaver. The UI is really well designed as well. Highly recommend.",good
Excellent App! Especially for focused practise!,good
Awesome app,good
Great update...,good
2012 REVIEW: Been looking for a simple to do app with drag and drop and this is the best.,good
Very good! Superb app,good
Thanks for your help! 😊 If I may I would suggest that you work on newly added tasks - it would be much more convenient if they didn't end at the bottom of the list. Thank you in advance.,good
Good,good
Amazing,good
Great app,good
Op,good
Good,good
"Enjoying this app. Works offline and gives you daily reminders to help you get things from your mind into a list format and encourages you to work through them in one day, or whenever you can.",good
Wonderful application,good
Love it! Gives me everything i need and let me do a monthly subscription so that I can have the few extras that you get with the paid version. Free or paid are worth it,good
Very nice app👍,good
Good,good
Cursor missing often 😒,good
Goods app,good
The best organiser at your finger tips,good
But I want my vip subscription today,good
"No se por que, pero no me notifica sin sonido",good
Good,good
Good one,good
Excellent app in every way.,good
I'm loving it 😁,good
I absolutely cannot live without this app. I use this everyday with my family to handle our things to do as well as plan out our schedules. The integrations with so many different applications is another aspect that makes this app a must have!,good

Awesome,good
Reminder isnt part of standard app. Needs upgrade,poor
Reminders are a premium feature you have to pay for. This should be basic.,poor
"Using this app for atleast 5+ yrs and suddenly the team choose to make reminders a paid feature !! I mean if you are so desperate atleast set a small amount for reminders but that's unacceptable to pay full premium for such a small feature which was the basic thing since the start. Goodbye Todoist Edit (after reply): So you mean, me & every other person who is complaining are all wrong. Reminders were never premium until some time ago. I was using that for more than 5 yrs on free plan. Have courtesy to not lie atleast :(",poor
"I was recently diagnosed with inattentive adhd and was hoping this app would be an answered prayer for help managing the symptoms, but nothing has changed with reminders since my last attempt at using this. Come on Todoist! Reminders should never be a ""Premium Feature"" in a task management app!!!",poor
I was super happy to download this app but that I soon realized that you have to pay for an alarm so that you get notified for your to-do list,poor
"I would give todoist more than five stars; However, you keep ignoring users for enabling them to show completed tasks by default is just irresponsible, please add an option to always show completed tasks!",poor
Not good,poor
"Horrible, most of it you have to pay. Even to put a simple reminder.",poor
Why do I have to create an account and sign in for a simple to do app? Hella sus,poor
No reminder options for free version of this app. How can one purchase without having the opportunity basic experience of what such app is really needed for. My alarm clock would be better than this app. Sorry I don't recommend.,poor
Lack of reminder in free version,poor
I don't liked becous it is not have the time in my tasks day 😭😧😩😢☹️🙄,poor
I will increase one star each day it will help me achieve my goals.,poor
"Developer holds notifications as ransom for a monthly payment. Would be acceptable for a small membership fee, but I have to pay for all of premium just to get notifications, the whole point of a to-do app? No thanks.",poor
"Constantly buggy. I've used this app for five years, and they are always pushing bad releases. Right now there is a crash expanding lists, which would have been found with some quick testing. Several years ago I filed a ticket for a big where it jumbles up sublists. Every few months I check in and out still isn't fixed. The web app is not letting you expand sections. The windows app was scrambling the order for months. They must do zero quality control.",poor
Why is alarm feature premium? It's the most basic utility someone expects from a to-do app.,poor
"PROBLEM WITH NEW UPDATE. Since the latest update, the app keeps crashing everytime I try to expand a task's subtasks using the built in ""down arrow"" button on the right side of the screen. PLEASE FIX.",poor
"12 hours, just 12 hours I had this app. Received 6 emails for todoist. Why do you think it is acceptable to bombard me with email? On top of the email issue, to make any real use of this app you have to sign up for the premium service. Wont be coming back. Uninstalled and you been added to my junk email list. Pathetic!",poor
Doesnt Nofication me,poor
"Cant use it if notifications dont work. Wont pay if I cant full feature test.....lets take this Corolla for a test drive, we can pretend its the Supra you imagine it might be... but first pay us to find out where you were just imagining vs how it really works....lol. Too bad, genuinely need a good working product.No thanks, it always requires mindless divulging of my banking info, you cant have that, if you have a product you trust let me see it,if I like it,you can have my banking info. Lol",poor
"For getting something basic of having reminder is a premium feature in this app, which does not make any sense to a reminder app",poor
"Very simple check list application, if you don't pay no teminders, no comments, nothing. Also there's no even taking simple notes stuffs. Just checklist and and sub task. If you want very basic, use it but tick tick ist best one. Sorry guys. It's reality",poor
"I like the concept but it is very complicated, specially entering recurring tasks or editing.",poor
"Really ,push notifications and notifications in general as a premium feature in a to do app....i know you need to make some buck out of this masterpiece, but did you really had to restrict the feature people use to do list apps for.",poor
"cant use for reminders so what, good is this app for?",poor
Requires sign in. Lol no.,poor
"On free version can't even set a specify time for a task (can only set a date), nor set a reminder. What's the point of a to do list app without these functions? Uninstalled.",poor
"Need to pay $36 for gerring reminders, the most basic feature of a to-do app. It's like ordering the most expensive gourmet dish at a 5 star hotel and then the hotelier asking for additional money to add salt to the food. LOL. Better to use Microsoft to do and lot of others!",poor
This app is a joke They want you to pay for simple feature like reminder whats the purpose of free app then make it all paid,poor
No reminder alert for free version.,poor
Why the heck do i need to log in with my credentials for this app.. what dev.. you guys think i need to keep a record of what tasks i completed earlier in life and i will be very happy to do that. Ridiculous.. uninstalled.. just needed a to do list app as simple as that.,poor
👎 notifications $,poor
"Not intuitive. I swear items have disappeared. If you want to see what you have already done, you have to pay for premium. No thanks. Back to using Keep.",poor
Not so great app apart from its natural language input. Only recently added kanban view but lacks any basic requirements like reminders in the free version. Also the android widget hangs almost always. Never gets updated.,poor
Very bad app does not work,poor
"Via Google assistant, not good. I get the feeling from the current reviews that people are using the app and not Google Assistant. My first experience via Google Assistant has been horrible to say the least. The voice assistant in this app he's badly programmed and kept on misunderstanding what I was trying to do as simple as create a task, complete a task, read task list. It was very difficult to know when to talk as the voice just kept continuing so one had to wait until it completes.",poor
"I didn't get even the access to add lables and reminder which done for free by many others. I look forward for doist to include at least lables and reminders with the free plan. I really loved but without the mentioned features in the free plan, I don't want to make it my to do list app.",poor
All functionality comes with premium account only... Shud have more flexibility for those who are looking for free version,poor
"Good design but when you uncheck items on a list it doesn't put them back into their original order, making it pretty much useless.",poor
"Reminders are a PREMIUM feature for some ungodly reason. They are a must for a todo app, what's point of writing it down if you keep FORGETTING it?!",poor
Data-mining rubbish,poor
"It is reliable. The app itself is great. I give one star for the price only. Condering my phone have ""reminder"" app that is free and built in. This app is really just ""burning"" my money. Thanks but no thanks.",poor
Downloaded the app and added a bunch of items and a couple of categories. Opened it back up a few hours later and everything is gone.,poor
ridiculously complicated,poor
Spam,poor
"For sure, this app is good enough, but! After a year of usage they added reminder feature to a premium access. Without reminders your app is useless. Thanks a lot. Even comments went to premium. Completely useless app.",poor
This app does not work on my smartwatch. I am not able to log in.,poor
"Starting out this app was ok, but then I started noticing how limited this is for the free version. Only 10 projects, and where did my completed tasks go? Those should not disappear until I manually delete them. A week into using this, and the workflow I was beginning to establish has been interrupted because my completed tasks are no longer showing up. These are recurring tasks I do daily. I don't know if this is normal for this app unless a task is specifically set for ""daily"", but it's lame!",poor
"Extremely complicated to use. can't understand a thing. good app, but it needs a whole tutorial because it does so much",poor
"Keeps spamming your email (even after you uninstall the app) with marketing emails. No, I don't want your app, I did not like it, I did not subscribe to you email subscriptions, get lost",poor
doesn't actually store any notes,poor
"used to be my favorite apps, but sync bugs drove me crazy too many times, auto replace link with title made me mad, cancelled subscription & uninstalled",poor
"I am colour blind and dyslexic. Not able to read anything. I can't zoom in and I need to pay in order to see the colours better. [update] As I said, I would have to pay the app in order to have the right fonts and colour so I can actually read and make use with it. I've tried WeNote, and it's the app I need, without having to pay premium.",poor
"I've tried a dozen+ task list apps in the last few days (and many before that), looking for certain features. I don't know if this has them because it requires an account just to try it (no ""skip login"" option). Nowhere did I see the creators/reviews say an account is required even for starting/basic use. One star: non-web, non-collab, non-premium features should be accessible without account. Then I finally read 1- star reviews, now glad I didn't sign up: apparently the spam emails never cease.",poor
Worst most useless app I've had the misfortune to try. Literally zero point in having this over Google calendar. Don't waste your space. It's useless. You can't have recurring tasks& everything is behind a pay wall. Avoid.,poor
"I can't do the things I want , like setting alarm",poor
NOBODY IS RESPONDING TO MY SUPPORT EMAIL IT HAS BEEN DAYS WHAT IS THIS? I NEED HELP ALL MY INFO IS GONE AND NOBODY IS DOING ANYTHING FOR DAAAAYYSSSSSS,poor
Everything was a purchase immediately after downloading. Bummer,poor
"Please allow more complexity in setting recurring tasks for example daily routine go to bed at 10pm ev weekday and go to bed at 12am ev fri, sun. It's frustrating having to create multiple tasks for the same recurring task just because I want it set to a different time. Will leave my review at 1 star and upgrade to 5 once fixed. Look forward to any updates from Devs on this one.",poor
"LOL greedy app devs. They charge $36 annually or $48 if you select the monthly option. If you get the premium version, it'll allow you to receive push-notifications for a scheduled task. Like, to set a timer / alert for something on your list. Uninstalled. For $40, the app better be making you breakfast in the morning.",poor
"WARNING RE THIS APP. Got Premium, followed instructions to Integrate w/calendar w/vpn active, got security alert minutes later that an attempt was made to login to my email account w/my password. Had to hustle to protect my account. Thank you Google for superb alerts, shame on you Todoist for open back doors.",poor
"This is the to do app with the best features (or just the features I personally need). However, my recurring tasks keep disappearing, which is simply unacceptable behaviour for a to do app.",poor
"You will be asked to upgrade to a premium just for the sake of adding reminders. Well that is not satisfying, reminders should be available just in the beginning.",poor
"Fighting the input method rather than getting stuff done. ""Natural language"" will no way allow me to set a task called ""Register for 3 Oct SAT test"" for this Friday. Something simple as adding a note requires Premium. I'm going back to ToDo",poor
Too expensive. Ticktick is better,poor
Too complicated and not well organized,poor
It started to send emails asking me to add go running or make coffee..I wanted a todo list that I could share with my wife..not another wife telling what I should be doing,poor
"What good is a todo list app without a reminder, why would you make the most important thing a premium feature. Don't download this app it's USELESS!!",poor
App is not starting.. just showing blank black screen,poor
Great app but the fact I can't see my recurring tasks for example for the whole month to know if I'm free on specific day in the future insteas I need to check week by week is a deal breaker although I did pay for the premium and this feature is not avalible. Will give 5 stars if this important feature is in the app.,poor
"Minimal features to force premium purchase. This app advertises itself as a an alternative to Microsoft for people forced to migrate from Wunderlists. Wunderlists was an excellent, fully featured list app with reminders, repeatable tasks, folders to group similar lists, and the ability to share any list with anyone via email or the Wunderlist app. Todoist allowed import from Wunderlist and mostly supported these features until summer 2020 update made every useful feature ONLY be in premium.",poor
This app let's you create 1 list then when you go to create the next one you can't without paying.,poor
Cannot delete account. Tired of getting email notification everyday. Worst app ever,poor
It is the worst app in my life .!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!,poor
Charges for service not received. Can not contact,poor
Not as good compared to other apps. Not a very user frndly interface and essential features like reminders are pro features.,poor
"TD;DR You have to register. You get blasted with emails. Free version is as good as free native app. It's not clear what features you get if you spend money. It's disappointing. Most features are behind a pay wall (which is fine) - I'd be more than happy to pay if I understood what those features are and having used the app, I still don't know. Also you HAVE to register with them and as soon as you do you get blasted with emails, which is by far the most annoying thing this app does.",poor
Everything is a premium feature. Everything else is a basic list,poor
Worst only useful when you are using premium,poor
Too complicated so uninstalled but still getting unasked for and annoying emails every day.,poor
you need to subscrib the app to use it they make alot of thing lock and to unlock it you need to subscrib .,poor
"In daily tasks, if i tap once on yesterday, it becomes tomorrow. Where is today?",poor
"Money-grubbing app that charges ""premium price"" for features that other apps offer for free. I don't see a single feature that would justify spending 4 bucks a month on it. Ad supported is better than this slick dump - at least you pay just once to remove the ads and then you can enjoy your app. That being said, just writing your list out and crossing stuff off is preferable to this with no monthly charge to do it",poor
"Daily emails, can't even see my important emails because of spammers like you",poor
Not really usefull too difficult to use,poor
Bad reviews are a real turn off for me.,poor
What good is a task management app if it cannot give reminders,poor
Without paid membership there was no use of this app.. so guys don't download it.,poor
"You want me to pay you monthly so I can have a reminder?! Ahahaha, you must be out of your mind!",poor
Poor support response or lack thereof. You can't fully delete a history so I had to create a new account. Been waiting 12 days for support to transfer my licence over. Have followed up and still no response. Very disappointing. Ref no 507634,poor
"Can I rate it zero? I spent time explaining support that new widget doesn't follow anymore default /system android theme. Before this ridiculous widget update it followed it and switched to dark mode automatically. Nothing fixed and only meaningless questions from, most likely, outsourced support is all I got. Note 10 Plus/Android 10/June security patch EDIT I do not use any custom launcher. Running stock firmware, totally",poor
"glad i only selected 1 month. they try too much to make a sleek design, that its counter intuitive, especially for repeating tasks.",poor
"This app will send spam everyday, even when you block them.",poor
👎,poor
"Sends lots of emails, you can't choose a duration for your tasks it's only limited to a day . It's good if you like to be bombarded by emails for a task that you totally know it's not over due , also the user experience is too complicated",poor
I deleted this app and it still sends me emails everyday! Its a waist of time anyway,poor
REMINDERS are a PREMIUM FEATURE in a TO-DO APP? Really????,poor
"Awful, can't barely open it up. Just black screen on the main activity and that's it. No reboot or reinstall helped. Fix asap.",poor
"Sends mails claiming monthly payments of $4 without yearly commitment but monthly without yearly commitment costs $7 And also the app is quite crappy without premium, and premium at $4 would still be too expensive for what you get.",poor
Every thing is for premium users!,poor
Required me to sign in to use it? Pass.,poor
Without premium features it's just garbage. What have kept you guys from removing the free version from Play store?,poor
"App not starting on my Xiaomi Mi 9 SE, Miui global 11.0.6. Just a black screen. The chrome app does work (clicked on add to home screen from the website) but I really wanted to use the widget. Very disappointing",poor
"Worthless, u can add tasks and things to do in the future but it won't remind you or allow u to set alarms unless you pay for premium membership... Lame.. #instantdelete",poor
Way too expensive for the premium features. While I don't mind paying for an app there are many other apps that track to-do items for far less money,poor
"Reminders are a premium feature, which is what I needed this app for. It really sucks that I can't use reminders for free. I have to continue the search for a good reminders app.",poor
"Now you can't even see the *today's* completed tasks without paying premium? Seems like ""how much inconvenience can we cause to the users to force them to pay before they abandon the app?"" This is a todo list. It's not like you've solved a new problem, produce content, or provide any significant service. Response/edit: currently, you can only see by project or subtasks, but not by today's tasks. Seeing today's completed tasks is the bare minimum to observe your progress throughout the day.",poor

"The company has removed the feature that elevated the tool from others completely unannounced.

Would not recommend to anybody - there are tons of better tools.",poor
"bug bug bug bug bug, please don't tell me these bugs are features because i am a android programmer too.",poor

"The recent update is kinda trashy. It no longer automatically assigns dates to tasks when I type ""tomorrow"" or ""on 8th June"" along with the task.",poor
"No free trial, cant even try it, JUNK. then they spam you forever",poor
I need to pay just to use reminder damn never using this app again so money hungry.,poor
"Terrible for free use, can't even schedule reoccuring events all at once- have to re-enter everything each time they occur! When you have a lot of things that happen every day, several others once a week, still more at other intervals, this App is useless unless you PAY.",poor
No options to repeat a task. Why else would i want a to do list? Might as well use a pen and paper.,poor
No Reminder option. Why u showcase it in ad when it's a paid service?,poor
"I just installed the app and ran it to see how I liked it. For my taste, way too crowded UI. Then, I started receiving email notifications at least once a day about a task it automatically creates for the user, which is to add a task. I was annoyed so I uninstalled it. The email notifications continued. I had to manually unsubscribe from receiving email notifications about a task I never created from an app I am not using. Unjustifiable behavior!",poor
Have to pay $4/mo if you want the reminders to work. I have ADD. The reminders are the #1 thing I need in a to-do list!,poor
Can't work effectively on the free version,poor
"Was looking for a replacement for Wunderlist, and found this app. Looked like a great alternative to Wunderlist. Installed the app, and started to setup bill reminders, only to find that, thre primary reason fir a To Do app is reminders, is only available for $36/year. REALLY?! NO THANK YOU!",poor
You create good think bt every option you when i use just close it and subscription to much price 350 par month os is really....,poor
"reminders are premium features now, means app is completely useless. need to search for an alternative that can migrate tasks now... great 🙄",poor
"Putting ""reminder/notification"" as a premium feature makes the free version totally useless. Uninstalled.",poor
"The old navigation was better, especially on desktop. I miss being able to edit directly, now I have to go through more steps.",poor
"I've used the new major redesign for a month or two now, and it's definitely a step back. Especially on desktop web. Editing is such a chore now, I hate the pop-up!",poor
i bought full premium version for lifetime in 2016 and didn't use much at that time. Now it says i have free plan and wants me to pay again for upgrade... please help,poor
"What mess, can't undo a task if pop up is disappeared, this app is too overrated! Lean from ticktick...........!",poor
I dont need my card to set the reminder,poor
"2 out of 3 features require premium. No, I am not going to do that.",poor
it is impossible uninstall this one,poor
Reminders is a paid feature. What a joke.,poor
", every time I put a task in it removed the number in the name and put it in my inbox.... Why???",poor
"Really difficult app to use. Loads of problems and shortcomings. For example, there's no calendar so one can't go back to the day a task was set. I'll give it another week or so but if I haven't got to grips with it by then I will delete the app. This app is far too difficult to use for my little brain (IQ 147) so I have uninstalled it.",poor
Reminders feature behind in app purchase. Seriously? Thats the most basic function of to do list. No way im going to pay you monthly just for reminders,poor
Subscription for reminders $5. Well it's fine I will move to Google Tasks.,poor
"The smart schedule feature was removed without notice. Until that's fixed to me, the app is like any other to-do app, I've started to look elsewhere",poor
Worst,poor
"Will never touch this app again! Tried twice - on both occasions I've regretted it. Considering alternatives like TickTick or even Microsoft Todo, I don't know why you would actually pay for this. Not worth the money. Support is also condescending and incompetent. It's all good though - you got my money. 🤬",poor
Basic features such as reminders and labels need an upgrade. And it costs 3200+ rupees in India. That's how much we pay for an entire year's electricity bill or groceries for a whole month! Way too expensive for such basic features. NKT WORTH IT! USELESS APP!,poor
Too hard to use. No tutorials make it worse,poor
Anything beyond keeping a simple list (including reminders) is paid,poor
"Seems pretty fancy, but $32 a year for reminders when most competing apps offer that as a basic feature for free??? For a to do list app??? Yeah no thanks.",poor
Baad,poor
Many features are available just for premium,poor
Garbage,poor
Time reminder available to to premium only ..??? Really !!! 🤬🤬🤬 pretty desperate to earn some bucks .,poor
"Looks like it would be a nice app, but basic functionality like setting a reminder is an in-app purchase",poor
Reminders are behind a paywall,poor
Used to be affordable. Now more expensive than US pricing!,poor
"One of the key premium features of this app is labeling, which unfortunately doesn't work properly. When I try to move a label to a shared section, the app crashes. Additionally there is an inconsistency between Android and iOS in how the labels work. In Android I can see the whole list of labels even without tasks, on iOS a label is deleted when there are no tasks marked with the label. This together makes sharing labeled tasks with my wife really annoying",poor
"Subtasks are completely useless. If you plan on using subtasks and have it repeat at all, it just does not work. A ""powerful"" Todo list and Google's Keep app with checkboxes has better functionality.",poor
Boring,poor
Pretty cheap when basic features are premium and cost $4 - $5.5 monthly. Immediately uninstalled. I'll stick to Any.do for now. Premium is almost half-price.,poor
Everything included in premium feature . Only frame work is there.,poor
Widget not loading?!?,poor
"I spent hours trying to get my Wunderlist info imported to todoist with no success. Looks like it might be a decent app, but guess I'll never know.",poor
No notification on free version ☹️,poor
"Worthless, uninstalled after 2min what is the point of adding my schedule and goals without having a reminder!! This is the basic goal of the app you can't make it premium just make the full app with subscriptions instead of scamming people to have more downloads",poor
It disturbs when they send unnecessary e-mails,poor
"The natural language thing is a gimmick and a nightmare to use. Simple tools would be so much easier. Despite paying for Premium, just to get reminders, it took me almost 10 minutes to set a recurring task and it still didn't automatically set a reminder. I've been patient, I've tried, I've read and re-read all the rules (spent hours trying to learn everything) but it still doesn't work. It obviously works for most people but I found it to be an over-complicated and frustrating waste of time.",poor
"I am using this app for years, premium version. Until now was working fine but for a month or so the sync between mobile and desktop client is not working so the app is useless for me now. Wrote to support without any reaction. Don't recommend.",poor
I dont like this,poor
Basic features like comments and tags are behind a subscription wall,poor
An outright scam!!!! For absolutely any basic functionality they are going to charge and everything you add will incur extra charges. Just a get rich quick scam by a couple of cheats.,poor
"Guys, what is a task limit? Why? It's not the way it should be.",poor
Free or trail version has nothing! You can't set a reminder for your tasks!,poor
Everything behind a pay wall...,poor
"Pay for everything except if you are here only to create and delete tasks. You have to pay for reminder, label, comments or for atleast the dark theme.",poor
"Reminders, the most basic of features, is ""premium"" in this app.",poor
"""reminders are a paid feature"" That's one of the most basic feature of a to do app!! Why even bother to have a free version? THIS IS STRICTLY A PAID APP.",poor
There are no recurrent feature. Reminders feature is premium.,poor
"Please revert to your old version & interface! The new widget has made the app completely unusable. It used to be my favorite task management app and now I'm searching for alternatives, on the verge of uninstalling it! P.S. Please introduce a feature to permanently sort items by date on the widget itself, when you add a new task. I have to keep going to the main app to sort it by date.",poor
After the latest update I cannot find a way to sort my All list by due date any more. Thus the app is now useless to me.,poor
everything is premium 🐸,poor
Requires account. It's free because they make money harvesting your data.,poor
Once again you've made this worse by redesigning the widget. It was fine as it was. Now I can't select multiple items at once to perform one action like tick off more than one thing at once or set a new date to more than one item. If this carries on I'm definitely not renewing my subscription. Please restore,poor
"I couldn't figure out a way to sync with my Google Tasks, and then now the app won't uninstall from my watch.",poor
"Subscription service to enable simple reminders is ridiculous. I was willing to pay a one time fee for a solid app, but having to pay nearly $5 per month just to enable reminders is absurd. Once I saw how many basic features were being kept behind a pay wall, I had to stop using it",poor
"""Reminders are a premium feature""",poor
"Two word - Paid mess. Please dont waste data and get tricked by editors choice , just go for a better app.",poor
"Don't lock reminders behind a pay wall, or if you do, make it a 1 time purchase.",poor
"Update 04.2020 - this is getting worse and worse still, with every update. Now they made it harder to edit your task - they moved it behind two clicks. Why?? Seems like this app is moving away from the todo-app for power users to just another todo app, same as any other. This is the last time I paid for the premium subscription. Time to move. ----- It used to be the best for power users, but after the latest ""updates"", the app keeps getting worse and worse. I am not really sure who this updates are for, definitely doesn't seem like it's for its core user group.",poor
"Rescheduling tasks is simply randomly not working. Rescheduling something for today can make task dissapear, earlier I have experienced that it duplicated tasks. This way a basic functionality is broken and I just lost what should I follow-up today... No activity log available, as that is a paid feature. I guess I will never try that now.",poor
Dislike the latest widget downgrade - the loss of the ability to select multiple tasks is frustrating. Not sure how long I will stick with this app now as the widget is far less user friendly than previous version.,poor
Anything that calls itself a to do list that doesn't include a reminder unless you upgrade is useless. Uninstalled.,poor
I want to schedule a task daily ! Should I add it every day ?! What's the way ??,poor
"New android widget is garbage. ""Full control"" yea ok you took away useful features and gave us more theme options. Can no longer open app from widget and most importantly you can no longer select multiple tasks from the widget which was super useful for rescheduling.",poor
Good,poor
Mostly features are for premium account and you can not delete account once you create. Disappointed with to this app,poor
I will use other app. I will not pay,poor
Not easy to use. Horrible design.,poor
Needs registration. Can't use existing caldav task accounts,poor
In basic app why can't even add comment its not even basic when it comes to free.,poor
$36 per year for push notification reminders? No thanks.,poor
Requires my email? No thanks.,poor
"First, the app changed my task name. Then, the task just disappeared and was not in the app. Bad app.",poor
The Google Calendar integration is riddled with bugs and it has been this way for months. They don't fix it and they are pretty slow on their communication. TickTick is becoming very tempting.,poor
Pay to remind??? Really???,poor
Total waste of money.,poor
"I bet it would work for someone who mainly needs a list, but personally I need alarms and reminders to keep me on track. I was looking for one when I found todoist that was advertised as having a reminder setting. I was disappointed to find out that the reminder function was a paid function, so I uninstalled the app. I bet it would work for someone else, but not for me",poor
"This app is ok, but it really needs start date functionality. Their reasoning behind not adding it is terrible.",poor
"Team , I took subscribtion but app is not working. I try to add task but I can't see the text etc. Something is wrong.",poor
not convenient for users,poor
Reminder is under premium! Seriously! Must need unstall,poor
"Love the idea and functionality of the app but it consistently crashes for me. Luckily it saves the last edits made, however, it is still hard to use when it crashes so often",poor
"Everything great. But you guys have made basic reminder a premium feature, very disappointed 😞",poor
"Just needed somthing to record things I have to do and to remind when I should do them, then got hit instantly with a paywall, not a cool start tho.",poor
"App is not for me. I paid $4.00 for 1 month of Premium service and is still shows I am using the free app. I immediately contacted customer service (twice), and it's been more than 2 weeks into the 1 month I paid for and I still have not received a response from anyone at Todoist. I'm still trying to figure out how to customize this app to suit my needs, but since I don't have the Premium app in order to do that, I will be uninstalling this app.",poor
Not helpful,poor
"Overrides set task order if priority is not at the same level - your selected chronological order will be ignored without any option to disable this. If tasks are completed and restored they go to the end of the list, not the position you chose making this inappropriate for projects that are recurrent like mapping out activities of daily living. 1 star from me + an extra since order may not be important to others (eg. for shopping lists).",poor
If paid account bit costly,poor
Please add start view that has many favorite projects easily accessible. Would be better if it was possible to add top of the list. It is not easy to use with one hand since everything is in the top left corner (please add material design button for favorite projects to bottom). Lists do not automatically sort and sort needs to be done again if anything is changed.,poor
No reminders in free version. And pro version is very costly. They should lower their prices according to PPP. Todo list without reminders is useless. I can use any notepad app instead of free version of todoist.,poor
Everything was great until i wanted to send a push notification reminder for a task and you tried to get me to pay for it. A simple push notification and you want me to pay for it.,poor
"I'm really disappointed with the Wear OS app: * The reminders doesn't works as expected: I hear the notification sound but there is no notification popup, and if I scroll down on the main screen I see ""No notifications"". How am I supposed to know what task I was reminded about? * I can't add a new task with a due date, e.g: ""test 20:10"" because as soon as I type 20 the "":"" button dissapears from the top suggested keys and is not available from the special keys / second keyboard page either (I use the default/google keyboard so that can't be the issue). * The sync is slow, after I added a new todo on the web I had to open the Wear OS app a few times so my new todo also appeared there. Could you maybe add a pull to refresh feature to manully trigger the sync?",poor
"When i type some words in the task they just disappear (eg sun) Doesnt allow me to rearrange the tasks under the project, this is a basic feature.",poor
Reminder is chargeable service . No point,poor
"The sound reminders are basic, should be on the free version. Price is absurd. Just gonna continue with tick tick.",poor
Even after 2 years the sync is still garbage? Wow just wow...,poor
"Earlier it was an excellent app without premiums on reminders and many-many other stuff, literally everything was available. But with time it got only worse, these complicated swipes, circles instead of checklists, and ""modern"" trendy design while neglecting intuituve and easy style. And now what I see, after a year? Everything got even worse. What happened with you?",poor
"Updates have shifted to taking *away* features. You can no longer format text in sections and project names, as someone at Todoist decided that was ""simpler."" I'm 90% done switching to Notion and don't regret it one bit.",poor
Most of it's premium.,poor
"App is good enough but drains your battery, for that reason I'm uninstalling it.",poor
Apparently syncs with Alexa but I can't get it to work. Disappointing.,poor
Too complex,poor
A lot of functionality but not so simple to use,poor
That app is good but I could not benifit,poor
"I downloaded this app because it's one that syncs with our smart speaker. However, I have recurring tasks, some of which are daily and that option does not work at all. It works are far as setting them up goes. Once I mark a task as done it skips the next due date. So my daily tasks are only showing up every other day. Not happy with that at all. I am in the process of finding another app ASAP!",poor
"Decent app, but forced to pay for basic features. Not enough customization for tasks",poor
"I subscribed premium however always have issues with syncing with Todolist servers. So my tasks disappeared, rearranged and completely messy. I spent almost an hour every day to arrange them again but next day they gone again. Please fix this.",poor
Almost no productivity without premium version.,poor
Sends you really annoying emails saying you have zero things to do on your task list or an amount. Even after you uninstall the app it still sends you this unwanted junk. Have to reinstall and delete account.,poor
Everything is premium,poor
"- Can't have more than 150 tasks per project, even of you pay. - Can't have more than a couple a certain number of projects, even if you pay. - Sharing from chrome and hitting the ""paper airplane"" button on the keyboard instead of the app dialog freezes todoist and chome :( :( :(",poor
Sort by priority is missing,poor
"The widget was, finally, perfect. So of course someone had to make it less functional. Because obviously, a 3x2 widget tucked away in a corner of the home screen isn't a thing that a person should be allowed to have. No, clearly, only a widget that's required to take up MORE than half the screen will do. Is there seriously a good reason the widget can't be resized to something sensible any more? Because I can't think of one. And I am seriously frustrated.",poor
"every now and then, out of blue, it stops syncing across platforms I use. last time it was buggy update, this time is sfsin no idea why.",poor
I'm two years premium subscriber for the app. It seems great but the only thing makes all the benefits disappear for me: inability to see all finished tasks by label. Guys it's high time you added this to Android and Mac. Doesn't seem any difficult.,poor
"""THE VERGE"", Says this is the best to-do list app right now! WELL...I guess it is best to settle for less than best voted app. This app is missing essential bells and whistles unless upgrading to premium. One particular major example is the Archived Projects. This is a premium only feature, however as folks may miss-click and not undo, they will never see what tasks were needed to complete unless they have a great memory, but then if they had a great memory why would they need a task list....",poor
Paywall heavy,poor
I realy didn't like titack is better to me.,poor
Disappointing...,poor
"Normal app the most features on premium account like backup cloud, comment, labels and reminders too.",poor
"Not for me, im trying to setup notif: take medicine at 4 am. Need to pay. Sorry, no.",poor
"After using this product for a month on the computer and my phone, I have found it to be laggy and frustrating to deal with. The free option isn't as good as other options such as Microsoft To Do and the paid solution offers little more than these either.",poor
"I came from Wunderlist. The most important feature of maintainung a grocery list does not work, because completed task are deleted after one day. I will look around further.",poor
"After getting the premium subscription I found that, Windows 10 app doesn't have any app lock mechanism. So anyone using the machine has access to Todoist! I'd request you to fix these kind of basic things before bringing more features.",poor
"Reminders are a 'premium' feature. No thanks, uninstalling.",poor
"Used it for 4 years, April they updated it and it's now a productivity killing app rather than a productivity booster app. Why? If you wanna rename your todo list you should be able to just click on the todoist and rename it right? WRONG, it opens a NEW WINDOW with sub taks!! I now have to click 2 times to rename the todo bullet. 2 times instead of 1.. Productivity or stupidity? I'm changing todo apps until they poll their users and understand that this is absolutely horrible.. Bye for now!",poor
"Way to easy to lose your task as they disapear when checked. Example, I got distracted for 10 seconds with my phone in my hand and ToDoIst app open and when I looked back at my phone 4 task had disappeared and I'm left trying to remember wish task it was! Really bad for an app that suppose to help you organize. I'm uninstalling because of this.",poor
Cost$$$$$$,poor
"Can't really do anything on the free version. No reminder, no scheduling",poor
You need to pay to add reminder/alarm which should be a basic feature,poor
Did I read that right? To add reminders to my tasks will cost me £36 per year? Are you crazy?,poor
Simple function like sort by name isn't working. Shame.,poor
"Meh/10 Came from Wunderlist. My wife has the iPhone app, and it is a reasonably functional app. Not as full-featured, but okay. This Android app was developed by someone who who does not care about user experience. In fact, they might actively hate their users.",poor
"I'm looking for a Wunderlist replacement. This is nice has some folder features that I'm using, but paying that much for the ability to set reminders or adding notes is insane.",poor
"The new widget is terrible. Even in non-compact view, the elements are too small. And I can no longer access the main app window from the widget. This was possible earlier.",poor
"I'm changing my review from 5 to 2. I'm a pro subscriber and love this app, but latest widget changes for Android are truly terrible. I can't click the todoist icon to get the app open anymore because that's gone, I can't click the reschedule shortcut button anymore because that's also gone, and I can't select multiple tasks to mark done at once via the widget anymore. But hey it's transparent now! Horrible update and I hope the team behind this update sees this review.",poor
Too many bugs and shortcomings to warrant the subscription cost imo. There are some great free todo apps as well which give you additional features over todoist free version.,poor
Only for singlr use.. cant assign task and sub task to others,poor
Y.,poor
"Changes in app function have resulted in consistent missed tasks and ""support"" provides condescending replies regarding the issue.",poor
"I am trying to find a decent replacement for Wunderlist. Todoist is merely okay. I'm vacillating between 2 and 3 stars, because the most common thing I need to do (ALWAYS add a task TO THE TOP of a list) is apparently not possible. The most frustrating thing so far is that adding a new task adds it to the BOTTOM of the list, NOT at the top. I NEVER want this behavior. Adding a task at the bottom of the list means the new thing is lost from view and I have to manually rearrange the list. On the web app, you can control where to add a new item by using Shift+A, but there is no preference to ALWAYS do this! There is also no way to do ""Shift+A"" (that I've found) on the Android app. You have to create a task, then manually move it to the top. Also, sorting by date either doesn't work, or sorts the wrong way, because the newest tasks are still at the bottom. I cannot believe that this is the default, behavior, and that it cannot be set in a USER PREFERENCE. I sooooo miss Wunderlist.",poor
Not flexible enough for my needs,poor
"Used to be a great app though the most recent update has made the widget unusable. Too small to see and there is no way to change the size, you also can no longer select multiple tasks, or pop out the widget to see multiple days. I requested to go back to the previous version, but didn't get much response so now I'm looking for a replacement.",poor
"New update has lost the ability to click on the widget and open the list full screen. The font is smaller, and ticking off an item on the widget has became more difficult. Please fix, five stars otherwise.",poor
So you tell me to pay every month for same functionality in premium? NO still doing normal in everything else,poor
"It was already very irritating to see your latest added tasks being pushed at the bottom and you have to everytime open the app to rearrange. And with new update you can't even open the app from the widget, you have to create a seperate icon which is super super annoying. Probably gonna uninstall the app if this is not fixed soon.",poor
Trying to set a reoccurring daily task is so convoluted that it requires reading a lengthy help article 😡😡😡? I've switched to Google Tasks which is way more intuitive.,poor
The new update destroyed the widget. Terrible.,poor
"--- EDIT: there is some annoying bugs when assigning a date: ""tomorrow"" is sometimes sent to next week and ""next week"" the week after. I double checked my datetime settings. --- Good tool but removing a star because of the subscription model. I would be happy to pay, but a monthly fee is difficult to justify by the extra features being offered. At least not for my usage.",poor
"New update to the widget makes it so I can no longer get into the full app by tapping on the widget, I actually have to go into my list of apps or create a whole other shortcut. You tout a fully operational widget but I can't rearrange my list entries via the widget, only the full app menu (and it was already a pain to rearrange my tasks in the first place, I really really wish there was an option to add new tasks to the top of the list rather than the bottom.) I will be trying out new to-do list apps now.",poor
"They fixed the crashing issue. Awesome. My impression of the app was 5 stars after that. What brings me back though is the latest GUI change to the widget. 2 stars now. They took away the ability to easily select multiple tasks. I am considering switching task managers now. I do not see a way to restore the old functionality. Also I used to be able to launch ToDoist from the widget. That button is gone now too. I am a long time user. I've reached the """"enlightened"""" rating on the app. Boo...",poor
"The new widget does not allow me to open the app directly, like it could before. Updates should never remove features. Knocking my review down - rest of the app is still great.",poor
Too complex,poor
Why would I pay for this app for reminders? It's just a goddamn simple feature!,poor
Subscription required just to set a reminder.,poor
"While everything else about this app is good, the process of scheduling a task is frustrating. Half of the time, it fails to recognize what I'm trying to set. You should just bring back the old scheduling layout from a few years ago. That was easy.",poor
"Cannot use because of the 299 entry limit. My most important list was split into 7 lists. The first list segment is full, so I cannot add a new entry to the top of it. I copied my lists from Wunderlist, and several lists got split like that. If it had copied starting at the bottom of the list so the first segment was the one not full, I might have been able to make it work.",poor
"'It's free, forever' but 'reminders are a premium feature.' Hmm. I'm dyspraxic, without much money to waste, and I'm looking for a to-do list app to help with this. Without reminders, this app is functionally useless to me. Disappointed that you've opted to content-carve to this extent, and I'd argue your claim of being free is misleading. Please reconsider which features to gatekeep, because locking basic functions behind a paywall makes me *less* likely to support you financially.",poor
"Can't use with VPN. I practice Information Security and prefer to use a VPN whenever I can. I use 2 Norton & NordVPN (not of course at the same time). In both usage cases, when my VPN is activated it would say there is no connection. I have even tried different servers. Is there a reason that VPNs are a problem for your service? How is your data management & security? Does your company view people's data? How do you keep others from being to steal others data, because username & passcodes...",poor
Why you gotta pay for push notifications or reminders at a certain point.. You guys are just a company trying to get rich.,poor
"The interface is very nice and simple, however, once I got down to using it and setting some tasks(five tasks total), about an hour later I went back to the app to make edits, but instead saw the list of tasks that I have set were deleted. If the app has an issue saving the tasks, it needs to be fixed. I will change the rating once that bug is resolved.",poor
"Reminders are kind of a core feature in a to-do list app. Why should I have to pay for it? The app is fine, but I can't use the reminders.",poor
There are better options available. I just didn't like the layout and functionality of the app. I tried it for a couple of months but now it's deleted and I am going to try another.,poor
Reminder requires payment,poor
"Functions fine in general, easy drag to subtasks. Can't adjust the Notifications to not go through ""Do not disturb"" mode (bad if you work off shifts), can't set timing of notifications. In a productivity app, scheduling is important. Reminders require premium, seriously? I'll just install one of the tons of free apps that include it for free rather than pay $3 month. Overall: Average functioning app that requires paid premium for some basic functions.",poor
expensive,poor
I was shocked to discover that notifications is a paid feature. I uninstalled. Would have been great otherwise.,poor
The main feature does not work - it doesn't remind me about todo with system notification,poor
The changes made to how completed task are handled are not only bad UX but they introduced many quite critical bugs! Please fix.,poor
The widget has been broken for the last couple of weeks since an update. Please fix it.,poor
"New update is incredibly finicky and makes it difficult to add existing items to projects, change dates, etc. Appending a task with #project_name no longer adds it to the project, it just takes it as a string literal.",poor
"I was keeping track of Christmas gifts by checking then off once they were purchased and looking back by selecting, ""show completed tasks"". Until today when I went to check and they are all deleted. Kind of a bummer. It was convenient that the purchased gifts were hidden and nobody could snoop on my phone unless they knew to select that option. But now I have to go through my hidden gift stash. Which if you are a parent... you know how immpossible that can be with kids around all the time.",poor
Not very user friendly.,poor
"Looks great, but not useful in free plan. And it's very expensive.",poor
Yeah keep everything for premium and then say its free,poor
I wish there would be a widget on lockscreen,poor
It seems like a good app with good features but it's not intuitive at all. I spent fifteen minutes trying to find a way to skip a repeating task this week and I could mark it done. I try deleting to see if it would delete just that occurrences but it deleted the whole thing. The icons are also not intuitive at all.,poor
"The latest update is poorly designed for users with lots of tasks, completely changes the old interface, with attending bugs, out of the blue. Biggest fan to dead in the water overnight. Shocker.",poor
"Revised review: Sometimes we seek out apps to help with deficiencies or make life work out. App was so great and so functional for months, until a few days ago. I was working around the changed, now cumbersome, reschedule/edit/rename tasks process. But Labels beyond a few characters are hidden now. Todoist Labels was The Thing for this app for me, with efficiently visually seeing/grouping tasks. Had made app ahead of many others. App needs more display settings then...to be usable again.",poor
The new update is awful. I have to do so many extra clicks to perform basic operations like moving tasks to different days. Multi-select doesn't work any more and the widget is totally broken. Rescheduling anything from the widget locks it up completely.,poor
گزینه آندو ش میپره,poor
"Every update have been a step backwards. All the small changes only made everything less convenient and looks like will only continue to do so. The last straw for me is now you can't add things quickly (to default ""inbox"" project) anymore, now you have to spend several more clicks to designate a project, even though I just want to add quickly to the default inbox. Making the quick add widget useless now. Also premium pricing has always been terrible and greedy (monthly cost instead of one time).",poor
"The premium version might be good but the free version is more restricted then other to-do apps, you can not even use the labels/ tags function without paying. If you are looking for a free todo list this is probably not the app for you.",poor
"Guys you created a great app that I'd been using for years, but the latest update is weird. Modal views when selecting a single task (WHY do I need it instead of previous submenu for rescheduling??), no ability to choose multiple tasks (only by top menu - select tasks), strange icons.. That all makes me really sad. Rolled out to the previous friendly Todoist :(",poor
(Sep 2013) took almost 1 year for decent reminders. Is still annoying to click twice to view the notes. Not very productive! (Oct 2019) with new interface the notes disappeared. The interface is just a copy of Wunderlist or TickTick. What is the point of paying a subscription when the competition offers the same functionality (reminders and notes) for nothing?,poor
Not a fan of the new Foundations update. You promised so many new features and didn't deliver any of them. The update to Subtasks didn't fix some of the core issues with them.,poor
To many features locked behind premium,poor
New layout and functionality is no bueno. Don't like the interface for rescheduling tasks. Please fix!!!,poor
Gud,poor
Would even pay & advertise but I am not able to see in one view WHEN future stuff is taking place...,poor
why doesnt the widget remember to sort by date? i have to keep going into the app to select sort by date.. can this be fixed???,poor
Versão Free não faz quase nada. Quase enganação falar que o app é gratuito,poor
"I tested a few task apps, and this one looked promising at first. But very quickly I hit the paywall, even for basic and essential features such as reminders and labels. I'm going to use Trello instead.",poor
You can't have your to do list as notifications,poor
"I hate when the things are no clear, basic features as reminders are in the premium membership",poor
"Kept getting ""an unknown error has occurred, please try again later"" .... Tried on several devices on my T3 connection, had no problem with other apps immediately after leaving this one. Uninstalled. Sad cuz it looked great. In re: dev's reply, yes I did that. I made sure it was plugged in and turned on too. I did take a look at the .apk and I've found an alternative for me for right now. Thanks.",poor
It just feel old...,poor
"Great app that suffers from the most annoying design flaw. Every time I create a task, it goes to the bottom of the list. I always want the task at the top so I can see it. That's the whole point of using a to do list. So I have to drag the task, one by one to the top. Makes me crazy.",poor
Almost every feature requires a premium account for 36€ per year... It's not even possible to test these features without subscribing to an annual plan,poor
You have to upgrade to get notifications...,poor
"Seems like a good tool, but almost nothing that I actually need to do with it is possible without a subscription. I'd happily puchase the app, or do a free trial period, but honestly, it annoys me when companies offer a free download only to put everything useful behind a paywall, especially when they try to give a discount for a year's sub before you even really get to try the features. Nope.",poor
"Its good for making lists, but if you want reminders or other features you need to upgrade to premium, its just not for me",poor
"Great app. Alas, I'm constantly reminded that ""Hey btw there's a paid version which has the functionality you're looking for : ) "". This is tiresome and the subscription based model just doesn't make any sense. Plus hey! Its expensive.",poor
"I tried the free version. I liked the way, that you are writing the day to remind you and it set itself, but the free version doesn't support calendar and for me this is a big minus. I prefer to use Google task app, that signs up with calendar and reminds you for the task.",poor
Tedious and annoying to use. Went back to using Google Keep.,poor
cant make into my calendar,poor
No longer able to add note to Todoist quickly using Google and Note-to-self. Yes you can do it but it takes 60 seconds instead of 10 seconds. Not sure if this is a Google change or a Todoist change but it removes one of the most useful parts on Todoist. I am a LONG TIME premium user looking for another tool.,poor
"I used to like this app. Been using it for a few years with tolerably okay results. But it's been having too many problems with sync, and with failing to load ""Karma"" data. Not only that, but if you miss checking a box but don't see that omission until the next day, there's nothing you can do about it. Maybe the fatal flaw of this app is that it has too many features for its own good. I'd like to get rid of sync entirely and just use the app on my Android, but apparently that can't be done, and if I delete my online account I delete everything. I think I just want to dump this flawed app and see if I can find a good app that does everything offline in one device with no registration required.",poor
"fantastic app a critical flaw... one touch completion, now when you brush the screen your tasks get set to complete and you can't find them easily.. (updated July 25) the developer asked me to respond to comment... thanks for responding. don't fuss on my part .",poor
why does my theme switch from dark to light every time i open the app?,poor
use Google tasks instead,poor
"Some pretty basic standard features in other apps are missing. The options menu is very limited with no option to default a tasks due date, project, category etc. These have to be entered every single time a task is created which makes adding quick tasks on the fly very annoyingly slower than other apps. There is no sorting options or filters on views (ability to create custom views does not exempt this feature from being useful). Too many clicks to edit tasks, eg notes/comments, rescheduling.",poor
"I am not receiving my notifications on any of my tasks/projects I have scheduled, so I end up missing out on things I want to take care of. I have it turned on in Settings. Why is that?... I utilize the Smart Schedule tool, but still no notification. Pls help or fix.",poor
"Awful UX/UI - I don't like how you have to use a rigid syntax to set recurrence for tasks. I like old fashioned controls, but Todoist is just trying to be different for no reason. Was on Premium for several months and gave it a fair shot - needless to say, I cancelled my subscription and switched to TickTick instead. I don't normally downvote apps, but this just didn't do it for me, and I spent money on it. I should have ignored the hype, so the fault is mine.",poor
"Mostly good but simply things like creating subtasks are incredibly fiddly, why can you do it from only projects? Why can you only do it by long pressing and dragging slightly to the right (to much marks is completed) allow a simple option on the menu. Deleting tasks is several options in etc. Doing almost anything other than straight adding tasks is cumbersome as hell and just frustrating. Needs some real UX love.",poor
"technically a paid app(pay for reminders), UI not as attractive as related apps.",poor
"Beautiful interface and design. Unfortunately most features are locked behind a subscription, including some important features such as viewing completed daily tasks. As is, other top rated To Do apps offer more features for absolutely no cost. Would consider paying a one time fee for it but the subscription is a deal breaker.",poor
Too many premium features,poor
Notifications don't sync without opening the app.,poor
"it's clear to me that this is the best todo app, and I've used it for a long time, but having reminders be a premium feature is just unreasonable as it's impossible to use a todo app without them. I'll be switching to TickTick.",poor
should tell the cost first,poor
The splash screen says the account is free forever. But to have reminder of events / tasks a fairly fundemental aspect to a task reminder app its £3 per month. That's quite misleading. #response to the developer. Thank you for responding. The main point is that a reminder function is a key aspect of a to do list rather than a premium feature.... best wishes with the app.,poor
Lost half its use once they got rid of seeing children categories in the widget. I use ToDoist for homework assignments and I used the parent functions for assignments to categorize what class the assignment is for. Without being able to see all my parent/sub folders from the widget it kills most of the use of the app. I went back to an old APK but then I started getting prompts that the app would stop working if I didn't update. I still use it as a grocery list with IFTTT until Keep is fixed.,poor
"The update got rid of a major tool for me. You can no longer press and hold the task to bring up the option to delete it. Not even sure how you delete on mobile now, which is very inconvenient!",poor
Doesn't even come close to Wunderlist or Any.do unless you pay.,poor
need to learn more,poor
"I like the app. It works, it's functional, and it's great. However, one thing still strikes me down. Why the hell are reminders a paid feature? Seriously, what's a To-Do app without reminders? I could use even my calendar, or almost any other app, and that would too have reminders, for free. So why should I pay for such a basic feature on a fully fledged app?",poor
"I have read quite a bit about updates being frustrating. Before applying the update, I had hoped to find documentation about changes. Found nothing on the todoist website, no comments in reviews. Update is attempting to be pushed, where's the documentation????",poor
"Fundamental problem in their development cycle...force users to update, but the value to the consumer doesn't have a feedback mechanism prior to forcing the update. Is there not a beta program with participating users? Todoist, that's what you need to fix. For everyone else,my widgets have lost their usefulness and are now just place holders until I can remove the complete buttons, shrink text, have fully customizable widgets, or settle on another app. but really, focus on the root problem.",poor
"Lots of emails notifications that you can not stop! Most of the features you need - including seeing a completed task - are all in the pro version (needs payment!) Edit after ""Doist"" reply: I mean the email notifications for the due jobs on the lists. They keep filling my email every day and I could not stop them!",poor
"New lay out is awful and takes extra steps to do everything that was once easy. App no longer syncs to my computer app, which has syncing problems of own. Since the last update it's slow on either set up and honestly no longer as good which is upsetting as I paid for the full year right before the update that screwed it all up. I really hope you guys are working to fix the lag, the lay out and the syncing problem. This last update was a terrible idea",poor
"dont like the layout, not very user friendly and you can't see your completed tasks unless you pay a monthly fee that is overpriced. don't recommend. there are much better apps that cost much less or are free.",poor
"""When you view a project, you'll no longer see all the tasks in its sub-projects."" - Mit diesem kurzen Statement wurde ein Kernfeature der App einfach ersatzlos gestrichen und zerstört somit sicherlich nicht nur meinen gesamten Workflow. Auf Nachfrage beim Support bestätigt dieser, dass man noch nicht genau sagen kann, ""wann genau"" ein ähnliches Feature dahingehend kommen wird. ""Generell zukünftig"" hieß es da nur. Da diese Anzeigeweise auch zentraler Part mehrer Projekte war, die ich mit Nicht-Premium-Nutzern teile, stellte ich dem Support des Weiteren die Frage, ob das irgendwann zukünftig geplante Folgefeature auch wieder für Nicht-Premium-Mitglieder verfügbar sein wird. Die Antwort darauf war, dass es egal sei, wenn ich ein Projekt mit einem Nicht-Premium-Kunden teile, da Premiumvorteile immer genutzt werden können, solange man halt eben Premiummitglied ist. Dahingehend also Danke für nichts.  Schade. So gern ich die App auch immer mochte: So kann ich sie nicht mehr benutzen und bei der gezeigten Reaktion des Supports will ich das auch nicht mehr.  ## Edit: ## Die Methode von Doist funktioniert natürlich auch nicht wie gewünscht, nämlich nicht mit Non-Premium-Kunden. Siehe Oben.",poor
"It seems like the developer is paying attention to customers, which is a good thing. Hopefully they'll respond to the overwhelmingly critical reviews of the most recent update. The checkboxes simply make it too easy to accidentally mark a task as complete. This is a bad, bad deal. I use Todoist to help me more efficiently run my businesses. If I errantly check off a task, it could cost me a lot of money, and possibly lose me a client. Hopefully you'll fix this right away.",poor
Have to pay for labels. there's no separate sections for different categories on widget,poor
very simple design that makes adding a task complex! also most useful features are premium.,poor
"It was so good and then the PC version became extremely annoying overnight. I'll add tasks in a project, the app will sync and move the task to an entirely unrelated project on its own. And sure, I can reassign it, but I didn't have to before and that's just an annoying waste of time. I don't mind waiting for it to get fixed, but I might just start looking for a new app, which sucks because I really liked this one.",poor
"Has become much worse when the sub tasks were removed, I liked having categories of my tasks sorted out into the categories. Please add back in the option to have subtasks show.",poor
where my reply ended up i cant see but i am a user for 2.5 years and this app never worked properly for me. i use for the script task adding feature and pay for supporting its development but they are not much interested i guess. businessline.halit.... try searching your emails. i wrote more details in original post.,poor
"Please I need help. When I try to log in with Google in the app, it said ""Unknown error occurred. Please check again in a few seconds"". I've uninstalled and re-installed the app, but no such luck😢",poor
Wunderlist is much better,poor
"cannot enter how long a task will take, which severely limits its use for scheduling",poor
i never understand why they never update or upgrade thier bad subtask? working under 2 years (I am using premium account) and managed hundred projects which I seen this app to weak too continue. I cannot handle subtask and moving them together that is really problems but they never fixed. i think i will change another for next project. this is enough. thank you,poor
it works. but WAY TOO EXPENSE and compkicated than most user will need. this free version has too many pieces missing and is just frustrating.,poor
"Removing features from the free version is not a good way to attract people to premium version, and the price is way to high. looking elsewhere :-(",poor
"Would be better if the Inbox was not treated as a project, but rather a scheduling location, and that items could be created in the inbox and EASILY (bulk) moved to other projects (but stay in the inbox) to then be scheduled to daily or next week or whatever Tracking would be easier. and the app would get a higher rating and I may actually subscribe.. Its a deal breaker for me.",poor
I tried out this app but decided not to go with it because it wasn't as intuitive as I like and might be missing some features. Imagine my annoyance to receive a reminder email this morning when I specifically turned off all notification settings. This app is probably great for people who like to be nagged. I don't. I like to be organized.,poor
Mahal. Harus bayar mahal untuk bisa mendapatkan fitur2 penting,poor
Really liked this app until they started charging for basic functions on a monthly basis...would have been happy with one time charge but not worth $36 a year when there is better for less...,poor
The free version is very limited,poor
"Difficult onboarding, no integration with google calendars, documentation is not very clear.",poor
reminder is a premium feature. really? the app isn't user friendly.,poor
its an average app to waste time on and increasing your work,poor
Looks good until you have to pay 3£/month to add labels,poor
Free features are MUCH better in Wunderlist app and second best would be Any.do.,poor
The free version has a minimal functionality. There more advanced free apps on the PlayStore.,poor
The chrome extension is awesome but not the mobile app.,poor
"As someone who isn't interested in task sharing or syncing, I find it insulting Todoist locks some otherwise basic features like reminder notifications behind a subscription instead of a one-time unlock. That's just greedy.",poor
"... hampered by the fact that too much of the functional tweaks are paid ones, COMPARED to dozens other to-do app I've tried and used. =( Seriously, the UI/UX is informative, the paid one is very multifunctional yet still as simple as possible, and the categorization/tagging feature is a hoot. I WOULD SOOO USE IT if not for that fact.",poor
Limited features with the trail/free version !!,poor
it's good to do stuff but it won't let me see the tasks I've completed,poor
items/tasks disappear; Search is hard to use; Annoying user interface to enter due dates that require you to remember esoteric lexicon to do things like reoccurring dates.,poor
Premium or nothing.,poor
"Hi,  I am using Vivo V5 Plus handset. I had downloaded ""Todoist"" for quick reminder but your application does not remind me on time set for work, if screen is idle and notify only when i turn on screen.  Kindly help me in this regard.",poor
I couldn't find an easy way to make a project recurring without using templates or add attachments and notes to individual tasks.,poor
puts basic functionality such as setting notfications behind a paywall you have to pay monthly or yearly.,poor
the only reason I had premium was because I could get SMS notifications while still be offline and not worry about unreliable push notifications. beats the purpose of having an additional app now than the default calendar.,poor
"Worthless. Contacted ""support"" through the app over a week ago, and still no reply. I paid for the year, but I will be cancelling it, as paying to have basic features on this app is a ripoff for the customer. Crazy to think I paid and still get no support. Go with another app and save yourself the money an the hassle of Todoist. THANKS. UPDATE: THEY HAVE FINALLY REPLIED, SO UP TO 4 STARS, AS AT LEAST THEY GOT BANK TO ME.",poor
"Maybe it works for some people, but this was absolutely the worst 'to do list' app I have tried! Every time I opened it, therr was a 'feature' blocking my use. The ultimate problem was finding no task delete function.",poor
You can't do almost anything without upgrading to premium.,poor
"There is a bug in this app. No matter what I selected the ""Change time zone to..."" pop up kept coming up. If this could be fixed I would definitely be interested in using it.",poor
There is better google keep than this if you need a free one. You need to pay to use this.,poor
يحتاج بال رايق و معقد مو مثل ما اتوقعت وقت ثاني يمكن احمله,poor
"App deleted my tasks out of no where, as well as the app seems to be bloated with features. Needs to be more sleek and refined. I dont believe the audience for a to do list app is looking for anything with a lot of features.",poor

Here if suppose 15 task have Priority 1, 30 have priority 2 then it is difficult to sort. Can you please add secondary priority filter like SP1, SP2, SP3, SP4 etc which we can assign to task and then u know we can see proper sorted view. Any timeline to add this feature?",neutral
Full power app! Sometimes a task gets shuffled on its own. Otherwise amazing.,neutral
"I saw this recommended and tried it. I really like the look of the app's widget. Some of the stuff is free and some is premium. I reviewed bout five task apps, and this came down to the finals but I don't want one of the features I need being behind a subscription. So I will be choosing something I can only pay once. Thanks for allowing trying this app!",neutral
"For the love of god explain me why there's no option to always show the tasks I've done??? I don't want to go to the main tab to the submenu, like WHY can't I reach today's ""done"" tasks from today tab??? And no option to make them not hidden as soon as a tap it done.",neutral
There's no repeat task daily feature,neutral
When I open a project then click on the arrow drop-down the app closest otherwise I normally love the app.,neutral
"Last update introduced a bug that crashes the app when opening sub task menus. Don't you guys do some bug fixing before updates? Another problem are the bad apps for Windows, be it the old (abandoned?) or the new Windows 10 one. They are just too buggy and unreliable.",neutral
"Todoist is great, no questions about it. Well built, nicely designed, regularly updated. I've been a premium user since Wunderlist was on the chopping block. However, I realized I'm paying $36 each year for essentially one feature: task reminders. Additionally, 2 users in 1 household on 1 budget pay 100% more for both to use the app. I think that's ridiculous so I'm out.",neutral
"It costs an arm and a leg, unfortunately",neutral
"The app used to work fine for me until a few months ago I no longer get any notifications. I've fiddled with Android notification settings, app settings, reinstalling, and so on, but nothing worked. I'm able to fire a 'preview' from the app, but it doesn't come in on the time scheduled. Hopefully an isolated issue, but I can't rely on this at all anymore.",neutral
I have to constantly resort the items when I add a new item in a list. It doesn't automatically sort by date. The new item gets put to the bottom.,neutral
It won't notify me,neutral
"Very good functionality, but let down visually. I'm not sure why you can change the colour of everything accept the task itself. When you use the widget the only way to color tasks on the same list is by setting the priority (which changes the tick circle color) but is limited to 3 colours, there's no way to change the colour of the text or background. You can add a label but that does little to influence the look of the actual task. Very odd! Also on the widget cannot remove the 'today' text",neutral
It felt like too much,neutral
"Can you fix the bug where when adding a task, the keyboard fills up past the options that lets you select priority and projects? It's not critical but it's annoying to see at a UX level",neutral
The free tier is close to useless and coming from Ticktick I found Todoist pricier and work fewer features.,neutral
App is great as a Wunderlist replacement but subscibing to get push notifications with a ridiculus amount of money? It is not possible. Unfortunately i won't use this app.,neutral
How can I stop it from sending me the things I enter the app to my email?😐,neutral
"the app is functional and the widget is very handy but the subscription model cost feels a bit much for all of the use I get out of it. I'd be much happier if it was a bit cheaper and when you consider some of the other free options that are out there, paying so much for so little feels like a bit of a con.",neutral
Only one snooze option. I need the option to choose how long to snooze an alarm. This is an option for just about every other todo app. Don't understand why todoist chooses to stick with only one set snooze time??? Respone to developer: No it doesn't help. When an alert comes up I would like to be able to select how long to snooze that particular alert from a several options. Not one snooze length for.all alerts.,neutral

When we add sub-task it gets added too slow!,neutral
"While adding time to a Task asked me to subscribe for premium 😂 I said sorry, uninstalling. I can pay for an app for extra features but if I am expected to pay just for basic functionality then plz make it a paid app at the first place.",neutral
"It took me a couple of days to figure out how to enter information without data such as 'may' converting to 'date'. I simply had to tap on the word and it reversed the automation. I also found out by accident that a simple swipe down revealed all the sub-tasks that I was entering. I thought I had to go back to the main menu all the time. A simple 'start here first' induction video would be great but the more I practice, the better the app feels. Still orientating, early days yet.",neutral
No integration with Google assistant. Will probably leave for more integration of hands free control.,neutral
"Very good at what it does, but doesn't come close to warranting a monthly charge.",neutral
"Does not integrate with outlook. Premium version require annual fee, with only cosmetic added tools. Can live with the free version but looking out for better app that syncs with outlook. now can sync with GTasks but require 'integration' app by 3rd party (pay thru the nose eg. $15/mth). would be good to have 2 way sync, for users to leverage on both apps (using premium subscription of Todoist)",neutral
"This app is not so good as a free version. You let us make subtask which is great... but not able to make a reminder is pathetic. For free version users, you can make a certain limit for using reminder. Also it will be great if you add a pomo timer.",neutral
"Some functions are frustrating. I was trying to enter tasks as theyre described in an assignment with things like part a, b, or c, but it always changed anything with a part ""a"" to a time. If I manually changed it so there was no time, it deleted the rest of the text.",neutral
"Wunderlist was Waaay better. Too bad that one got bought out. I need an app that syncs to another phone, and that let's me organize things the way I need them.

"It's good, but the layout requires an extra click to get to the calendar week view, and that's my favorite view because I want todoist to be my weekly planner. If I have to click into the app, click the side bar, and then click into the calendar view, it's too much work. Those three views (today, calendar view, etc) I would like clickable like at the bottom always, or the ability to swipe between the views.",neutral

"Looks great but no option to save to SD card, and I need phone space, so have to uninstall.",neutral
Its a nice app but to keep in mind your tasks it needs a notification but u have to pay for it thats what I hate in this app .coz it doesn't remind u that at what time u have to do a task it gets a little boring while this . sometimes I forget about my tasks,neutral
"good application, the free version is very limited since most of the functionality is in the payed version.",neutral

not that great,neutral
"Just learning, I'll check back later.",neutral
"Clean, simple interface.",neutral

Reminders and some other features should have been free.,neutral
"Touch & go, plus Google Assistant stated: it's not support with devise (integration). I'm using a Android phone and have the app on it.",neutral
"Ad-free, sync with cloud, can manage recurring tasks (interface not suitable for beginners), widget is functional. Premium is very expensive, licence for home-use missing. However the free version misses some very basic features to force you to the premium. Greatest mistake: no way to backup / export my own data unless I pay. Don't be greedy - it is my data, and you lock it away. Missing auto backup in the free version is OK. But no way to export / download it is a no-go.",neutral
Базовый функционал платный.,neutral
Not bad but the best features of this app is contain credit,neutral
"Update: thanks but still doesn't help - could it be phone? On Huawei mate 10. First review: Coming from wunderlist, main use shared shopping and admin lists with family, so have shopping project with sub project for each shop. I made the Shopping project the home screen, but can't see any sub projects and their tasks on Android! Can on Mac. Investigating Sections. So multiple taps hunting for undated tasks. Too complex for family, frustrating for me. OK otherwise.",neutral

"Well, i thought it's the best in the market as they clearly have 13yrs of experience now but i was wrong. I so wanted to avoid that (Ticktick) app but there's no alternate to it. Pros - Amazing sync & interface Cons - pricy, no calendar view or sync available within the app (like ticktick), no habit tracker.",neutral
I like it,neutral
"This is a simple app and should not have any premium features and yet, one of the most important things about an online to-do list: a reminder notification, costs money.",neutral
"Neither hate it or love it, but I hate apps where I have to have a log in....",neutral
"The concept is good and it's really helpful to have project tabs. However, it's really confusing when your completed tasks simply disappear? It makes your progress really difficult to track. Also the subscription price is really expensive! It would be better if it was a one time paymenr for full access to the features much like Nova Launcher. I hope to see these changes made so I can support this app knowing I got my money's worth.",neutral
Good,neutral
"I liked the app, it was missing a few things but It was okay. I uninstalled it at one point, until I decided if I wanted to keep it, but I am still getting notified for the reminders.

"Coming from Wunderlist, this is the best one I found. There is one thing which I find irritating. The added item goes to the bottom of the list. Can you add an option to sort by reverse date? That would make it perfect list for me.",neutral
"A nice, solid, basic app for tasks. I enjoy the features of being able to have different projects, priorities and easy scheduling. The push notification doesn't seem to work unless I've recently opened the app, so usually I get a notification of the day's tasks after I've already opened the app to check manually. I'm on a Huawei android. That's a big minus unfortunately.",neutral
Why too many steps to remove a project?,neutral
Simple. Clear. Unobstrusive. But alignment and form of edited note does not mirror that of the saved note in the task list view.,neutral
Charging every task,neutral
An app that makes you pay for something for a feature as trivial as reminders cannot be considered as an usable free app,neutral
Good,neutral
"If I select ""sort by date"" I want it to be automatic. So I do not need to re-sort items if I mark task done or add new task.",neutral
"I used to like this app because it was like writing in a physical notebook, but that smooth user experience is gone. I feel like they are focusing too much on adding new stuff while the core functionality gets looked over.",neutral
Not bad,neutral
"The app itself is great, it syncs with the echo to get your tasks... Without an audible reminder of tasks though it's not really any use and to get reminders is 3 quid a month.",neutral

Still trying it out,neutral
"App has a lot of features, unfortunatelly many not free of charge",neutral
Good,neutral
Shouldn't have to pay for reminders.,neutral
"Clunky for my purposes. Seemed like a good reminder app, I needed a list app. I wanted something I could use to save a grocery list, not something that tells me ""Hey it's Tuesday time to go to the grocery."" There's not a way to do that here without navigating too many menus. I'm coming from Wunderlist, so I am used to having direct and clean access to a group of to-do lists. Todoist hides your lists in favor of showing you upcoming tasks and reminders. I already have a calendar for that.",neutral
"This has been my favorite to do app for years, but suddenly the badge app has stopped working on my Note 10. If I don't quickly find a way to resolve this, I'll be looking for another list solution. 🙁",neutral
Reasonably decent to-do list but the yearly fee is too high for what this product actually provides.,neutral
Ok. Not as easy to add a project after task has been entered. A little clunky moving task to next day.,neutral
More steps to go through to access lists that were immediately available on wunderlist,neutral
It's fine. The widget does not allow for refreshing and the auto refresh never happens quickly enough if at all. If there was a way to get to the app from the widget it would be whatever but you have to go find the app to go into it which is :/ the app definitely has it's uses I'm sure but I have to uninstall because we use the widget and if it's not functional it doesn't work for us,neutral
Mainly making use of tasks. The sub tasks within make my day.,neutral
The new widget made the app almost unusable for me. Not being able to refresh the tasks from widget and the lost app icon from widget might push me to find alternatives unless there is a new update on the way.,neutral
"Looks good, but is for me worthless without notifications. And then 3-4 $ per month in order to activate notifications is way too much. Maybe 1 $ could have been worth in order to move away from Microsoft's free TODO app.",neutral
"Former version of the app: I tried several task manager services before settling on this one. Lots of good features without unnecessary frills. **** Update **** as of April, 2020... SO disappointed :( Unfortunately Todoist didn't know how to leave something alone that wasn't broken - and added unnecessary frills. The functionality has become too layered and cumbersome. What used to be done in any easy couple of taps now takes many steps. My time is too valuable to jump through the hoops they have created to add and reschedule tasks. After years of paying for the Premium and being one of their top users, I am in the market for a replacement. There has to be something that is more efficient out there.",neutral
Loved Todoist but the new widget is a massive step backward for me. Can't multiselect and reschedule multiple tasks anymore.,neutral
It was essential to me until the last updates.,neutral
"This app is ok. The thing that makes it stand out for me is that I've been able to set it up to work with Google Home as my grocery and to do list. However, since the update I now can't click into the full app from the widget, which is necessary as I'm unable to rearrange my tasks from the widget and I can't seem to find a way so that the app automatically sorts my tasks by 'priority'. I can only see how to do it afterwards.",neutral
Not sure yet about other features but definitely need the ability to access the full app from the widget,neutral
"I use Todoist every day and it is awesome service in general but the latest update to the widget made it absolutely unusable for me. It has too slim lines even without compact mode (compact is ridiculous, even though I have small fingers), the quick button to open the main app is gone and the WORST - it is now not possible to select more tasks and do anything quick with them. Bye bye fast rescheduling... I am greatly upset, it is my main tool for staying on track.",neutral
"Great app, BUT the update has ruined the functionality of the widget. I can no longer figure out how to select multiple tasks, and it is no longer possible to go straight to the app from the widget. These are to important features for quickly making more complex changes to your schedule. The widget could be improved, otherwise the app is great.",neutral
"Great app, but whin i installed it and tried the basic feature which is the reminder, it doesn't avaliable thats mean you cant also try the reminder. I appreciate that, becouse no one will give you his work as a free. Ok, i will give it less than 4 becouse i didnt see the main feature which I need.",neutral
I can no longer touch the widget to open the full app. What happened? I use to be able to touch the upper left hand corner of the widget and the list would open in full screen.,neutral
"Generally pretty good, but a lot of awkward design choices: no compact mode, inefficient use of colors for organization, difficulty selecting and moving tasks, lack of icon consistency, preset snooze and reminder time options rather than being able to choose them yourself.",neutral
Need notes option like Wunderlist has Get that and you'll get a 5 star I have the premium version and we want notes aswell as the chat please JUST LIKE WUNDERLIST,neutral
"needs registration, for online use...",neutral
"I'd be fine with paying $10 or $20 for this app. I'm not fine with paying $3 a month forever to continue using it. Without being able to use reminders on the free version, it's no more useful than a $5 pocket calendar, and I'm not willing to pay what they're asking.",neutral
"Really great app, but it sucks that you have to get premium to get the most basic feature: notifications for a timed reminder.",neutral
Nice app,neutral
"A few major issues: 1. The addition of sections in projects is nice, but not useful if they only appear in project view but not filters. 2. The sections cannot be reordered to appear at the top of a list, the can only be at the end of a task list. 3. In filtered view, pulling subtasks out of their parent task or non-completable tasks is ludicrous. Duplicating them like that is silly at best.",neutral
It's pretty good so far. I'm still working on coordinating it with my other organisational apps.,neutral
Please add app option to put new task at the TOP of the list for those that are coming from wunderlist.,neutral
Reminders should be available for all.,neutral
New to the app so still learning,neutral
"Ok for free but limited. There are better free apps. I want to add details to my DIY jobs, such as prices, links etc. I want to easily share. And I don't want the task to close every time I talk it trying to interact with it. Maybe just me, but limited and a little frustrating. But it's free so how can I complain",neutral
Nice app but would like access to a calendar without paying premium price,neutral
Would be awesome if paid but free version too restricted it ain't worth it,neutral
Useful,neutral
Having some problems figuring out what all this app offers; still learning it.,neutral

"Have been having issues since last update, when adding a to do, it defaults to go to the inbox folder, instead of going right to 'today' list. So have been forgetting to do stuff because I didn't see it lol. 5 stars otherwise once the issue is fixed. EDIT: Sane thing happens when I am on today tab and have it set as homepage .",neutral
"Layout and appearance is good but main features like alarm, reminder etc are available only in premium version.",neutral
"Being a ""free version"" user, regularly. I can boast about Todoist's opening yield of tools you receive. Although they are not much different or more varied than most other task apps. What makes Todoist stand out is the easy-to-operate platform. The simplicity mixed with the intuitive functionality makes this a hair more effective, enjoyable, & my recommendation for anyone needing some help being more structured. It helped me greatly.",neutral
I wish more options be available to free version,neutral
App is good to use but it's premium so Not using now.,neutral
Great way to start to get organized!,neutral
"Decent app, but not worthy of monthly fees. What happened to 1x Pro licenses?",neutral
Frustrating update plans.,neutral
There is no way to edit repetetiveness through ui unless I know the smart commands.,neutral
"Excellent with a single exception. I've used Todoist for about 5 years and it's the best app in its class- the free version outperforms other paid apps in my experience. The one thing holding it back for me is the home screen widget. On my phone it struggles to load, lags, is unresponsive, won't select tasks properly,, the list may well go on- in short there are so many things which sometimes break, it rarely works. This is fundamental. 5 stars if fixed. Til then, it's a reluctant 3.",neutral
👍,neutral
"It's good, but I don't like how it makes me feel bad for how unproductive I am... But that's just me! Nothing against the program",neutral
Keeps me focused!! But I don't want to purchase anything. I think it could all be free in my opinion.,neutral
"Google should make an app like this, it's Calendar app is not intuitive like this, giving this app low partly becuz of no integration",neutral
Looks very appealing and has support on multiple platforms however having basic push notification for individual tasks behind a pay wall is pretty stupid and makes it the app untempting to switch to. I would reconsider if the paywall wasn't a subscription or rather have the reminders as a separate one time purchase.,neutral
"ANDROID WIDGETS DON'T WORK ANYMORE. clicking on ""done"" circle but nothing updates. Only by restarting the phone, removing and re-adding widget to screen. Uninstalled.",neutral
Great app,neutral
"the app is good and I've switched to it from TickTick but then i switched to Microsoft Todo because of the design mainly but that's not the only thing. don't get me wrong it works but there are way to many features that are premium at least make the reminders a free feature because that is just absurd. maybe fix the design, add an all black theme and make the reminders a free feature but all in all it's great",neutral
"A good app, although disappointed that I can't repeat a reminder without paying",neutral
Please provide undo and redo for all actions,neutral
Phone: Samsung Galaxy J7 Star I just started using the app. I'll upgrade or downgrade accordingly.,neutral
"I recently downloaded this app and paid for the premium subscription. I like the app, but I have two issues that are hindering its functionality. The first is that the notifications slate quite buggy. I have 3 different daily tasks which I've set to notify me when they start, and I only receive my notifications sometimes. The second is that my workweek is Sunday-Thursday, and I found out after speaking with their support that there is no option to set a non-standard workweek.",neutral
"Super app with horrible widget. You can mistakenly complete a task by clicking on widget, and it's gone without you even noticing it. Free apps have better widget honestly.",neutral
Good,neutral
"Its a to do list that can go everywhere with you and no writing! Can prioritize list as well great little app 11/2019 edit- hoping like other folks that they undo the changes. This app has gotten more difficult and counterintuitive with the last update. Used to be able to select multiple items to reschedule at one time. Can't do that anymore. Also used to be able to just type repeat everyday, repeat every Monday Wednesday and Friday etc. It now seems like only sometimes that works.",neutral
"Very long time user. Latest updates are making things harder. Subtasks in recurring parent tasks are now automatically archived when completed and don't seem to reappear when parent task is due again. Example: I have a weekly todo titled ""Groceries"" with grocery items I need to buy as subtasks within that recurring parent task. Whereas before I could mark a subtask as complete and expect that same subtask to reappear next time when I go shopping again, it's now completely gone.",neutral
Not user friendly. Free version very limited.,neutral
Will this be available for computers soon?,good
Excellent,good
"It's a great app. Thank you. I wish it would let me to write time and cost of each task I list, so I could calculate how much I need to invest, also it would be nice if I could organize my tasks based on priority and change their priorities if necessary.",good
"Уведомления не приходят. Вроде для уведомлений использует push через Google services, но если запретить Todoist работать в фоне, уведомления не приходят. Другие программы: Telegram, Календарь, почта... в тех же условиях работают отлично.",good
"Fine app But still not install Due to hard working of todoist team, i give good rating",good
Would be 5 stars for sure except I can't add a task to the top of the list. It is infuriating for something that would be such a minor dev lift. And they do know about the idea per the forums. Love everything else.,good
"Please add support to add a task at any position (something like ""add task below/above"" )this feature is there in the desktop version but not in the mobile version",good
"Really like the app, but I've found a bug when watching the task of a project in board view, for some sections the tasks don't appear and the ""add another task"" button appear at the bottom of the app instead of in its position.",good
It is a great app. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. My only problem with this is that the premium has you pay for something simple as notifications,good
This app helps me alot in tracking and managing my different jobs.,good
This is really helping me be organized.,good
Me esta gustando el sistema que usa,good
Simple and intuitive,good
The last update is a win! The new karma & productivity interface are top notch! Keep improving this already awesome app for eventually reaching the perfection! Update: Love the new black theme! This thing is beautiful! Keep it up!,good
Good view and easy to use,good
"It almost perfect, it is missing a selection tool, where you can select more than task and delete them at once, also there is no way I can turn a normal task to a sub task to other normal task",good
"This is a really helpful app for personal use. I like just having basic to do lists for each day. I would like a better calendar view though, so I could use it instead of Google calendar. I am trying to build habits and routines, and this app is good for setting recurring tasks.",good
"Pretty good app, but crashes sometimes if you do something unexpected EDIT:contacted you with a crash description",good
Intuitive and easy to use,good
It's a gr8 app. Very useful for daily planners. But i would suggest it to have even weekly as well as a monthly planner.,good
"The best to-do app I have used for quite some time. It's intuitive, has lots of functionality and is as simple or as complex as you need it to be. You do need to opt for the Premium subscription to get the most out of it but the free version is still one of the best out there.",good
Helps keep your day on track,good
Its really good. But is there a way to create a task which repeats itself after certain period of time say every monday just like Google calendar,good
Amazing!,good
"This is a great tool to keep track of task lists. I like that it is available on Android and Ubuntu. It is fast, stable and easy to use. I'm reading Atomic Habits and plan to use the tool to track all my tasks. No more google calendar or written to do lists!",good
Really love the app. As it keep me on time and improved my productivity too.,good
It helps me keep up with daily chores. Having the reminder emails is a plus.,good
Good for tasks.,good
This is a great app with one major downfall. The completed tasks are removed from the list and can only be accessed after a lot of clicks. By default it should stay on the list in a striked out state. It is important to know the tasks which I completed on the day. Hope this is fixed soon.,good
Simple. Intuitive. Effective.,good
Basic functions work all well. Good UI and sectionings of works. Will get you through the basic needs.,good
"Really helps productivity, the email prompts and alerts are a little annoying but really helpful application which keeps my life organised love the link to Google calendar",good
I like that everything I need to do is right in one app with a reminder! Loving it! It also allows lists withing the list you are making.,good
[Review update] It's a good thing I put my subscription renewal date in Todoist as a task because they don't send you any notification that your subscription is running out.,good
"Im in love with this app! However, being forced to pay for the premium service on my device my husband's device for just notification feels a little bit wrong. I think for something like a to-do list notification should not be a premium feature. There is an amazing amount of functionality in this app and I have been through dozens of different to do it apps over the years and by far this is my favorite. It is so clean, simple, easy to use, and it does recurring todos",good
The date search doesn't work in Chinese. It understand Chinese date in a wrong way.,good
Pls add week days option when repetitive tasks are added. I dont want to do them on sundays but still it notifies me.,good
"Хорошее приложение. Есть подзадачи, а время и дату напоминалке можно указывать текстом. Например, ""завтра в 20""",good
"The newest version is great, love the new boards feature",good
"I dislike that I must pay to use comments, and I dislike that there is no way to add a description to the task. I understand that in regards to the former that you need to make money, but the latter issue makes it clunky if one has a long and complicated task with resources one must past links to in. But I do appreciate the app and am impressed with how consistently you stay on top of squashing bugs. Keep it up! Can't wait to see kanban implemented!",good
Why editing task is so difficult. Intuitively I long press to edit but no response. Then I have to figure out here and there to find how to edit.,good
Pretty good so far,good
The automatic schedule recognition fails sometimes. It would also be nice to have a maps integration - I do not think it is there.,good
It's good but not perfect because I have same tasks everyday and the tasks I kept and completed yesterday are not visible after they are completed the first day and that is the only one issue on this for me and that is the only reason I am switching to ticktick,good
good if u are a to do list person,good
"Almost perfect. With a lot on my mind and a million projects up in the air, Todoist does almost everything I need it to do. It's the best option out there so far, but I wish I could use it as my ONLY to do app. Would need the ability to: NOT have completed tasks move to the bottom of their section, but stay in their original order; have new tasks appear at the TOP of the Inbox list; toggle to swipe-only to complete (accidental checking :(); see a percent complete number or visual for proj/sect.",good
Okey,good
"Simple, helpful and very neat.",good
It's lived up to what it say it would do,good
"Free version has some limitations, but great productivity app so far--longest I've kept one going on the phone yet...!",good
I think an added calendar feature would make this app perfect! I find myself constantly going back and forth between Todoist and Google calendar to schedule my stuff! All in all a great app though,good
Its better to put more options for notifications Actually the best notifiaction options is for samsung reminder,good
"It would be great if you can set an estimated time for every activity, but it's great!",good
Make it easier to learn how to use it.,good
I like it but I do wish they could have alarms or reminders or something,good
Making a list is not something I find easy. But ToDoist is making it happen.,good
Best app ever! But we cant resort task from widget 😕 plz add this feature tnx alot❤,good
"Task sections with a ""/” in their name get converted to ""_"". Almost perfect. A feature I'd love is if using share could predict the project you're adding to based on the app you're sharing from. When I share from Spotify, YouTube or SoundCloud, it always goes to my ""Music"" project. I wish after doing that a dozen times todoist would know that I like to add these links to my ""Music"" protect and preselect it for me.",good
Works great!,good
"Amazing app. Definitely my to do app of choice. Wish it had a more robust Calander view, with a proper week view function. It's also increasingly hard to justify the premium, when free equivalents are getting so much better (Google's, apple, microsoft's), and note taking apps are becoming better to do lists (notion). A big gripe for me is that its design & UI is falling a little behind its competitors (things 3, apple reminders); which to me is almost the whole point of a todo app.",good
Pretty cool app the best for to list or management I've ever used.,good
Better than all the other dozen other similar apps I've tried.,good
Good list app. Simple to use.,good
So far good. Need to check for add-ons,good
It's the best In my opinion. But I feel tasks should not just be overdue. I think introducing an option to indicate that you didn't do a task or that it partially done would be helpful for helping people track how they do tasks,good
It was a gud experience and I found it useful to plan my exam schedule priorities.,good
Enjoying offloading from my head and the app telling me what I've scheduled from the day. Great for busy minds,good
not perfect but so far my favorite to do app,good
Keep a track of your grocery list or your daily goals or be on track for your long term project. This app will definitely help you in all the ways it can. Great for increasing productivity.,good
"Pretty cool, like a lot, has helped me very much",good
"This app IS great, and has the potential to be greater! However, my only 2 requests is when you add a ""Parent Project"" to your ""Favorites,"" please include the projects within it as well! And to also make setting alarms to your tasks more simple, and reliable. Thanks!",good
I appreciate the reminders!,good
"Great App. Well organized and User friendly UI. Although, monthly subscription is a bit much, I'd rather pay full price for the whole app and get all the features it offers.",good
Found usefull,good
I'd like to see a list of the tasks I've done in the last 30 days.,good
Add pomodoro timer,good
"Why can't I see completed tasks in any project? Sometimes the program shows them, sometimes doesn't.",good
"Well designed app, just wish it had some more flexibility for assigning dates and responsibilities. I also haven't been very successful at using the notification function.",good
Great but could use more assistance features to help automate your task management,good
Helps me reminder the important tasks to do.,good
I am still testing it efficiency.,good
Awesome to do and project management would revommend also i hope to get the premium soon!,good
420/420 amazing app that beats my lame ass planner,good
A really simple and effect app however you really need to upgrade to premium to get the most out of it.,good
"Enjoying the app, but can't figure out how to get it on my Galaxy Active 2 watch. Whenever I try to find the app for it, I get directed to the phone app.",good
Reminder is a paid feature and the premium version is too costly.,good
Free version is missing some bells and whistles but overall gets the job done.,good
So far this app has been very helpful. I will be trying out the premium version very soon. Once I do I will update this review.,good
"Easy to program, not bad at all",good
The handling is very fast and intuitive.,good
Works great,good
Enjoying it so far. I just cant seem to sync it with my calendar so I get no notifications for my to-do list and I need to open the app to check I need to do.,good
Nice app to keep me Focused!,good
So helpful tool.,good
It's fantastic! But I took a star off because they nagged me to rate it.,good
Eu gosto muito do aplicativo. A minha sugestão seria para ter a opção de não excluir as tarefas concluídas porque psicologicamente falando dá uma satisfação chegar ao fim do dia e ver todas as tarefas que foram feitas com um risquinho... 😉,good
Unfortunatelly you must to pay for reminders! :(,good
"I really like this app: the way things are organized and how simple it is. What I don't like is that the completed tasks automatically disappear and EACH time I wanna see them, I have to click on the option to show them. I wish there was a function were you can choose as default if the completed entries are hidden or not.",good
"I'm loving this app. I would have given 5 stars, but the only thing I didn't like is that it doesn't have any reminder. You have to buy it. Anyway, overall the app is impressive. You can go for it.",good
"I want to make a note buy present for April but it always converts to buy present due April 1st. I have tried ""April"" instead of April but it also doesn't work. Edit: April' works. It's the most elegant solution I can find. I can't find a way to just type text. If there would be and easy to understand way I'd give 5 stars.",good
"Found that on the phone app, the amount of tasks you can add to a project is limited (100 or 200), but on the computer version there is no such limitation. Other than that it's a good app.",good
Ll,good
As advertised very well organize... I don't use it as much as my boss... But he loves it... I'm sure I have much more future use for it...,good
Functional and serves all needs for to do lists. Will happily give 5* when integration for Alexa custom lists is implemented.,good
Straight forward,good
Good but a little overwhelming.,good
"Best task manager on the market. The ONLY weak points are sub-task handling and sorting on some views, but otherwise fantastic. Queries, fast entry etc. second to none.",good
"Switched to Todoist from Microsoft Todo and it has all the features from that and more. I wish that push notifications weren't a premium-only feature, as this was something Todo provided for free. Nevertheless, this is probably the best to-do list app I've used.",good
Very nice app! Easy to use.,good
For now am on love the the app is very very efficient,good
"Very good but don't see why 1 would pay when Google has Google keep , and calendar works about the Same and is free",good
Fantastic app to get it together. Still lacking a few features: eg creating lists,good
Great app! Keeps up to date,good
This is a useful tool,good
Missing back buttons on some screens. Otherwise great.,good
Very well done for improving your task management. Only the lack of badge count for android phone is loosing the 5 stars review,good
"So far so good. Wish I could see what was done on any given day. An option to show tasks with a completion indicator (strike through?) would be helpful. Also, would like to be able to mark a task completed for a previous day as I sometimes don't get to mark them on the same day.",good
"This is a really good app, the only reason for four stars instead of five is that it does take awhile to really get the hang of all the different things you can do.",good
Always a good thing! Great! Wonderful!,good
Overall it's a great app I just wish I could link it with my Google calendar or that it worked better with Google assistant,good
"I would like to have a widget on my homescreen, but I have to pay, however, it's really good for organize the tasks!!",good
Doesn't link with my calendar or emails,good
"I've been switching between task apps for years, this seems the most intuitive and allows me to be the most productive. Quite a few features are paid for though, and although I would be willing to pay a larger upfront fee, a monthly fee isn't a commitment I'd be willing to make",good
Gd,good
It's a great organizational tool,good
Very easy to use and really clear. The only thing I miss in this app is seeing the completed tasks. Besides that it's been a great app that helped my productivity.,good
Limits lists to 200 items. That was old. It's better now,good
"This was a solid replacement for wunderlist, but it isn't simply a to do list. It's more of productive tasks",good
"Great app, easy to use.",good
Great and useful reminder app but it has many feature for which we have to buy its premium version. Previously I gave it wrong rating by mistake i giving rating of another apps and by mistake i gave it the rating of another reminder app,good
great for use,good
Makes me productive because I'm always up to a schedule,good
Easy to navigate in order to keep track of tasks.,good
Great app. Are you going to add the ability to attach images to actions?,good
It's Good.,good
"Does what it needs to do. Very good integration with Google Calendar. The time of a task in Google Calendar is standard set to one houre, I'd prefer being able to change the amount of time I estimate to work on a task. Not being able to send emails as a task from different (g)mail accounts is a feature I miss. But overall very good app. Hence 4 stars.",good
Fun and simple to use,good
Just using the free version and use Inbox for just a list of things to do.,good
Pros: Intuitive design Great way to acheive goals Cons: Not entirely free It works with google calendar but each task only can be in 1 hr intervals,good
Would've been 5 stars if I am able to move around the arrangements of my tasks.,good
Best for schedule,good
It helps me think through all the elements needed to truly cross something off my list.,good
"Had this app during college and it great to quickly add in things to do and also to have schedule projects, very clean and easy to use",good
"This is a great to-do list app. However, the competition offers a lot of features for free which are premium here. This app should offer atleast reminder functionality for free. Maybe they can limit the amount of reminders and projects that you can get in the free version which might make it a compelling app. Right now, in the free version, you can just create lists and projects which are viewable in the widgets, but a reminder should be there even in the basic version.",good
"Very simple to-do list app, simple but quite powerful, even on the free plan. There are a lot of other apps that offer more stuff for free, but they are clunky to use. The only problem I have is inability to hide things that are only available with the Premium subscription, such as Labels and Filters tabs, but I understand why they're there...",good
"Am excellent replacement for Toodledo. Still a little rough around the edges, but being actively improved.",good
Great product,good
Really help me to manage my day 👍😊,good
Easy to use very stable and works well with GTD methodology,good
Does its job,good
helps to concentrate 🤪,good
Easy to use and packed with features,good
"Realmente es una muy buena aplicación, es fácil ubicarte y organizarte si ya sabes usar este tipo de apps. Lo que encuentro mal es que hay opciones básicas como añadir notas a las tareas que están escritas, y por ellas hay que pagar. Me gustaría que no hubieran tantas opciones de pago o por lo menos no tan esenciales. De resto está muy bien esta aplicación.",good
"Good for keeping lists of tasks and working through them. It is worth taking time to learn the different ways to use and organise the app. Sometimes it seems to be working against me eg in certain views, I can't drag tasks up and down a list or can't see them ordered by subject. [Edit follows, to respond to Todoist's reply:] Thanks for replying. Yes, as you say, ""sorting in filtered views is not possible"". Or to use non-developer language, ""Ugghhh, why can't I sort this list by project or in another way that suits me?"" This is the one thing that I dislike strongly about an otherwise excellent app. Wunderlist had better sorting and Tick Tick has it. I would love to see this change in Todoist.",good
"Excellent app with few feature limitation in free versions which are available on similar apps such as comment, reminder etc are locked on free edition",good
Good,good
It could be much better if I could see my done tasks and not destroying them...,good
Easy and practical 👍,good
It is a really helpful app. Thank you developers. I'd give it 5 stars if the notifications were somehow better than {overdue} 🤔. Maybe something more interactive [click here] &/or colorful.,good
Great overall app to get yourself organized,good
32780 Weather 666IU778 Is a Kitten 27gh with q many different 87878How 1,good
"So good so far. I give 4 stars just because I didn't use all features yet, so need to go back again to that raiting",good
Great so far after a few days free trial.,good
Great app. Does things easily. Maybe a video of effective usage would help.,good
This is the best. Why I give this 4 star? Because you need to be in premium to use the alarm thing,good
"I think its a great app, although I do have one suggestion. After completing a task, especially for the day, maybe it would be more motivating to cross it out and keep it there, so that one could see how many tasks they have completed till then and how much they have left.",good
Great for getting reminded of your tasks,good
Good app that reminds me of my daily tasks,good
The free version is a bit too limeted. However it does worth it,good
Only wish missed dailys wouldn't count for the current day too. Otherwise brilliant!,good
"Feature request: I hope I can manually reorder tasks in label views like it's done in project views. Of course, to be synchronized across all platforms. This will be cool.",good
"Great organizer, however, too many features require you to have a paid membership, while similar apps don't require any membership fees.",good
Love the app but notifications stopped working after couple of days and now I do not get reminder for anything on time.,good
It helps me keep track of my tasks very efficiently :),good
"It's okay. Easy to use, just wish incould add a topic/note header toneach individual note.",good
Wish the free version had more features,good
"Some issues with sync but so far, I am enjoying it!",good
"Great app, wish navigating projects on mobile was easier",good
"Mostly great, I just wish I could make my main to do list my home page.",good
"I have had a wonderful experience with this app. It has genuinely helped me keep track of things I need to do. It has help me gain structure in my life and I am really grateful for it. This is from a guy who doesn't even bother to use google agenda. Lol great app, good stuff and I hope they keep improving.",good
Right now i started this but feel very happy to install this application is its do easy and fast working.,good
Wish I could add pictures to tasks but that's about it for the negative.. Great app. Would highly recommend.,good
So far so good..Im seeing if its worth paying for...Ive tried sooo many organizational apps.,good
Easy to use. No dramas. Very streamline for basic list use.,good
"Works great except reordering shared projects always fails (my shopping project, my wife shares and she can never reorder on that project, but no problems on other projects)",good
Very simple and easy to use.,good
Great for groceries and remembering long-term to-dos,good
Very nice,good
It is great,good
Just getting started on it.,good
"Overall good, I just wish the alarm feature was available for the free download",good
Appreciate this app. It gives me a convenient way to list tasks on the fly!,good
"Nice interface, good help, good configurability. Integration with desktop outlook is a bit of a pain though.",good
Nice if you're bad at remembering everything you have to do. Quick and convenient.,good
Loving it...,good
Easy to use,good
"Good application, it keep me focused on my goals. One downside is whenever I put a new task on a specific day it doesn't areange it automatically, i have to do this manually",good
Is it possible to implement statistics on completing repetitive tasks?,good
This is a great tool with a minimalist design. One feature I would be willing to go premium for is the ability to change task orders using drag and drop in the widget. That would take this to the next level.,good
"Easy to use, wish printing lists so they fit on one or 2 pages was possible",good
"This app is awesome. I have a sugestion, in the app can't see the projects order by folder, will be good can see by folder",good
This app is such high quality in its usage and visual design. It's on par with the quality you'd expect from Google.,good
"It's revolutionised the way I work as a medical student. Makes going from one task to another effortless, allows me to stick to breaks, etc",good
Awesome app. I am enjoying its simplicity and effectiveness.,good
"Simply brilliant, they put a lot of effort into a quick and smooth user interface (keyboard shortcuts, keywords, date detection) that allow me to implement GTD (almost ;) ) at the speed of my thoughts. Keep up the excellent work!",good
Very good!!!,good
This app is one of the coolest app,good
"One of the best ToDo apps out there. Started using it as a personal reminder list but the more I learned about the app, the more conveniently it weaved itself into my life. Now it is an important part of my workflow.",good
Exceptional tool to boost one's productivity. Thanks for this amazing app.,good
"Been using this app for a couple of years and overall it's been solid. It's not only a life-saver but it also provides a clean minimalistic aesthetic and intuitive options throughout the ENTIRE app. High quality developments. Seems only natural to have bugs here and there, or else they'd never be able to improve the app's functionality and innovate as a result. Attentive helpful customer support team, devs, AND they provide guides,templates and very helpful tips on their site. Keep it going :)",good
Love it!,good
"2020 update: 4 years later I have upgraded to a premium version, especially after all the newly added features. I've tried many other list/reminder type apps and Todoist stays my favorite. 1st review in 2016: I'm still getting familiar with the app after a week but it seems to be very easy to use. Simple adding items, categorizing them. I'm using the free version.",good
Good stuff. Helped me realise what a stupid slacker i am. Brb gonna go jump off a cliff now,good
Best app for to-dos. The highlight is Natural Language Processing.,good
Great!,good
Changed my life,good
Simple but flexible app for managing todo lists and notifications.,good
"It does what I need when I need it and it provides me with in information I require to be more efficient. Plus it is linked to Alexa so it it easy to add tasks or even groceries to my lust. It's a win, win!",good
Great app and it is way better than your regular reminder application. Gonna start using it for my daily life routine,good
"It remembers my todos, so I can focus on executing those todos. Helps alot in achieving more.",good
Can you please available the mobile reminder service for free? It's very important for me but I am not able to buy it.,good
"Awesome app, helping me to boost my productivity everyday.",good
"Love it! Simple to use, and just the perfect amount of prompting",good
Best todo app,good
Superb.,good
"The bug's been fixed so i wanted to update the review! Todoist is a really great app; it's slick, it's easy to pick up & use, and it's been essential to me in my day to day life. The date and time input for tasks is super intuitive (ev 10 days/ev 1st & 16th of the mth etc) and I appreciate how easy it is to have tasks loop even with weird intervals. The free version has pretty much everything the average user needs, but I'm sure the features of the paid version will b well worth the price",good
Amezing,good
Extremely useful app!,good
Very useful. Thanks,good
"Great app, I'd recommend to anyone that has problem solving, and anxiety issues. It helps me sleep to be able to make todo lists for the next day.",good
Really helps me get stuff done and on time...,good

It is great app to plan your day. It is easy to use and fast.,good

Basic and nice. I can advice,good
Nice app,good

Love it! Easy project organization and to do list option. The widget for Andriod is AMAZING!,good
👌✨,good
"Since last major update, rescheduling a task takes you to the day where it is scheduled, preventing you from quickly rescheduling all tasks on a given day. Productivity killer.",good
This app is where I have outsources my brain. My entire life runs on this app and it's so smooth compared to many others. I love how seamless the experience feels between devices,good
"I have used the premium version of this task manager for several years. Cross-platform functionality is a must and it integrates well with several other programs (email, calendar, IFTTT). Great for those using GTD methodology. Try the free (limited) version, then upgrade for full capabilities.",good
It's a great app for the one's who don't want to waste their very single moments in this life. It's helpful in achieving goals and to increase productivity in your daily life. Thank you so much to #Doist. Keep moving forward ♥️,good
The best of the best Plan youe entire life 💜💜💜,good
Great app to plan your day!,good

I am new to it but so far an excellent app,good
This app is so amazingly done and so helpful. I can't begin to describe how much value this app has to me. This app make a huge difference in my life by allowing me to build habits and be consistent with them!!,good
Helps me member and get so much done,good
"Todoist is simple, customisable, and helpful app to get things done. Must have app for Productivity.",good
"Definitely the best app out there for syncing honey-do lists, especially if your life is complicated.",good
Brilliant App! Been using it every day for over 3 years and I love it.,good
"Great, clutter free, to the point app with enough features (if you think it doesn't exist, Google it! There's many hidden things you need to know!)",good
Excellent and very helpful,good
Love the sync,good
"A pretty easy way to keep track of tasks and set reminders, whether recurring or not",good
You remind of the todos I had planned to do and didn't do. This keeps me updated. Love it,good
Helps me cope with my preoccupied life,good
Love it. Feel less stressed and more organised lately.,good
Best todo app ever,good
Extremely helpful at helping me keep track of all the task I need to get throughout the day.,good
It's very easy to add tasks with its incredible Natural Language Processing.,good
"Most clear and useful app out there. Tried many, keeping todoist ❤️",good
Superb app! fulfilling more than expected,good
Just amazing. I just want an option to set the list in order that i prefer even if I set them by !!1 !!2 !!3 or !!4.,good
"Perfect for daily use. Don't look further, this is your planning app",good
Perfect and awesome,good
it was easy to use and very helpful to put my to-do in a digital form,good
Love this app!,good
I love it,good
Android has very few todo/reminder apps that are even worth downloading. This app is an exception and definitely worth the download.,good
Excellent App.,good
Very user friendly. nice UX job.,good
Awesome app. A request to the devs: I wish there was some way o take notes in this app that is linked with a task. So it will be better for future reminders.,good
"Best to do list tool. I have 30 things to do every day but this app keeps me in line and I meet my deadlines. Between remote work, homeschooling, running errands and holiday shopping, this is so useful. I even have it on my laptop so the team who created this...thank you!",good
A fantastic app for trying to manage your life and time.. yet still fail. But the app actually makes me remember that I have something to do. But still.. I won't do it.. for.. reasons.,good
A real help to get up to speed with remembering task of new job.,good
"Awesome, saves so much time and effort",good
This app is a big help for me in my Work-Study-Life Management.,good
Good,good
"A literally effecient app to plan daily & shleduled tasks, goals as well as projects. Easy & user friendly UI. Whether user just wants to note some random tasks or very specific scheduled tasks & projects; it's useful.",good
The best customer experience I had in 12 years.,good
Super useful app!,good
The free version is pretty easy sofar,good
"Update: As a big user of sub-projects, I was disappointed to see their usefulness go when they no longer appeared in the main project. However, I have recently been pleased to notice the new ""Sections"" feature now allows me to replicate that functionality, and being able to display them a board is a nice touch. I also appreciate how the functionality of the Wear OS app has come along when other developers have been dropping watch support.",good
UPDATE: Thank you for the fantastic updates on this product! I've moved completely to Todoist now and greatly appreciate the support community. Recommend subscribing to Carl Pullin's YouTube channel to learn all kinds of goodness with using Todoist. Use for GTD. Capture is excellent! Processing and Organizing are easy. Still working on review discipline.,good
"This app has blown me away! Rarely if ever rate an app, but there are no ads, and the free version is still incredibly highly functional... Just so impressed- well done to the team!",good
Great,good
"Es útil para tener todas mis tareas pendientes, además funciona bastante bien.",good
My organisation skills have never been as good before I used this app. Its on all my devices. Makes sure every day of the year is not wasted,good
On the free version. Very intuitive and has made a difference to my organisation. Thank you!,good
"Satisfying, concise and helpful in organizing my workload accordingly. I recommended this app to many people, it's definitely worth installing.",good
The best organizational tool on my phonesv,good
"Great, simple app for managing daily tasks. Keeps your tasks in sync on all devices.",good
"Just think of this app as your brain 🧠 🤣Anything you think of put it in the inbox. This is your RAM( Random access memory ) power. No storage required, give ur brain the much needed space 🙌🏽. Take a look at YouTube video tutorials. There are a lot of people using this app with really good setups. Definitely set this using ur computer. I believe this is the only way to link ur calendar. Gmail has the best integration.",good
"Love it. It's simple, but just the thing I need to keep my to-do list written down and handy for easy access.",good
Excellent program and several YouTube videos to better understand the use of the software.,good
Very functional and satisfying to use! On an Oppo phone.,good
Imposter,good
Excellent Task Management 👍👍,good
Bom,good
Very Good!,good
I'm really enjoying this app. It's helping me juggle between planning my cross-country move and daily life,good
Easy to use and can integrate with other apps,good
Can't imagine living without it 😅😅,good
Good,good
I've used several and this is the best I've used. Clean interface and every feature I want.,good
It could really help me to be more well organized,good
I really love this app.it helps me focus on my study,good
Good,good
Used this app to get away from physical to do lists I had scattered everywhere. Works great and I appreciate the ability to really organize my lists!,good
It helps me be more efficient!,good
Great app helps plan my day and give me foresight into what's coming up,good
"I love this app, *but* with the disclaimer that I don't like how it syncs with google calendar. When I synced it, ALL of my todoist entries showed up as calendar events, making it impossible to use my calendar. And, I couldn't un-sync it. So I ended up having to completely delete that todoist account and make a new one with a different email. That was some time ago (two years?) So it's possible the sync function is improved.",good
Like the fact that Desktop and App syns automatically,good
Excellent application,good
"I love it SO much! It's skyrocketed my productivity level & my focus, it's easy to use, & the features in premium are so worth it- thank you to the Todoist Team!!",good
Love the product. Keeps my life on track.,good
Great experience.,good
Sync across devices easily and quickly. Easy to create lists and love the layout,good
This is the best to-do list app. Much better than Google or Microsoft alternatives.,good
"I love how easy it is to add items, and that they sync across platforms and devices Also, that I can add them to /through Alexa",good
Very good experience with todoist,good
Perfect software for actio items management,good
🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘😘,good
Great app,good
To focus on studying with this app is a brilliant idea cause it reminds you to do homework even more strictly than your teachers. A must-have app,good
Enjoying the process to choose what is essential.,good
Very effective way to plan and execute the day to day activities.,good
I looooove this app i really recomend it its easy to use and it reminds you,good
Very good. It's worth using properly. Take a little time to learn everything about it and you will find that you have more time and less stress.,good
Its perfect for student's like me who take every day as challenge and tend to forget what's important each day.,good
Great!,good
For a disorganized person -me- this is a big help and pretty easy to use,good
Excellent and very straightforward and easy to use especially now Boards (kanban-style) are here. As I am very spatially-oriented this is ideal for me.,good
"Switched from an extremely full and disorganized calendar, notebook, and phone notes to Todoist. Now everything is in project folders and I can keep track much easier - one for each of my classes, work, and home. I love it and now I spend less time on my phone and more time getting stuff done. My only suggestion for the Devs is to allow users to hide the large ""labels,"" ""projects"" and ""filters"" folders if we don't use them. I don't like filters and wish I could hide it.",good
"Nice app, useful and easy to use. The free version has lots of options to serve the goal.",good
Very useful. It helps keep track of productivity very well.,good
"I have found this app AWESOME so far! It really helps to remain organized! Just 1 hard suggestion, if possible, please add facility for completing periodic goals, like what i am working, is for betterment of my carrier in coming 5 years. Thanks a lot once again!",good
Wonderful app! Really helps me to work on what's important!,good
Perfect,good
Good app... helps to check each activity on hand.,good
It's a great app.... love it,good
I love the feeling of ticking off things I've purposes to do and actually accomplished at the end of the day and todoist aids in that great sense of accomplishment. Super grateful,good
Maybe I'll get around to using it!,good
Best productivity tool ever,good
Excellent app. Very easy to use!,good
"Powerful, convenient and intuitive",good
Worth it. Simple Elegant Useful,good
"This is beyond helpful when planning out my day. I use this for both school and personal projects. It's aesthetic, organized, and simple to use. I'm in love with Todoist! 💛",good
Love it! Nice way to stay organized,good
By far the absolute best to-do app! The free version is great and the paid version is even greater!,good
Awesome experience 👏,good
This app changed my life. Nice overlay.,good
Very usefull app for procrastinators,good
Still learning how to integrate this app to my workflow.,good
Goods App,good
Very versatile and easy to use,good
Been using this app for 3 years.,good
"Best app to manage your to do list, and its syncing feature b/w laptop & mobile is amazing...",good
This is beginning to change my life.,good
The best option for productivity. Use this tool with GTD system and see the magic.,good
Intuitive and very helpful 👌,good
Very user friendly,good
"If you work it, it will work for you.",good
"It is a great productivity tool, keeps you on track with everything you set out to do",good
Best todo list I have used so far. Works on every device I have just perfect ❤️,good
I've tried to use to-do list type applications before. I see the benefit in them. But they never really stuck with me. The customization and organization options in this app make it great. I use it daily.,good
The new board view is a nice improvement.,good
Great,good
Great reminders,good
Awsome! Love that google assistant take my voice notes to todoist!,good
Great so far,good
"Loving it so far. The absolute high that I get from checking off important tasks on a to-do list is indescribable. Todoist is my white rabbit. But actually it really is great. Feels intuitive. Other than an occasional crash when I move tasks to different sections, causing me to reopen it once again, I really enjoy using it.",good
Great app to keep on top of life!,good
Great for basic lists to project management!,good
I love the app,good
"**Second Update, Sep 2020** A solid choice 👍 Have been using Todoist for about 5 years. They are like a very slow 🐢 (in terms of releasing features) that you love and hate at the same time, but at the end of the day, this is a super powerful tool that has passed the test of time. Highly recommend.",good
Amazing tool to organize your day.,good
Great app.,good
Great app,good
"One of the best apps I used in my whole life. Superb, thoughtful, subtle design makes you want to use it, and this is the key!",good
I'm enjoying a lot my experience with todoist. My productivity is increasing.,good
I love it,good
This app is fantastic! It is so easy to use and has a sleek dashboard that makes it easy to follow up on my own tasks. Free version is great and has all the features I need.,good
Superb,good
The perfect to do app.,good
Awesome,good
Absolutely love this App! Especially it's support for markdown 😉,good
Phenomenal,good
"This app is making me manage better! I love it, specially when I use it on different platforms and web. I definitely suggest it to my friends.",good
I like the app so far. Good game changer.,good
cool app,good
Honestly the best app I could ask for. Managing and completing tasks in a form of projects.,good
Good,good
"Greedy app...Not worth the cost, atleast can make it a one time purchase. You can install Google Calendar, tasks ,habit tracker seperately for free and still use it",poor
"Wanted to try it out but the features I wanted (pomo, monthly calendar view, etc.) are only available with a subscription. Wish I discovered that before syncing google calendar info.",poor
"Used to be a good app, now it's all buggy...",poor
Pointless to have an account if you cannot have a task that lasts two days without paying for premium. Pomodoro is also premium.,poor
"Crashes my phone everytime a notification pops up to ask if I did a task. Shame because I like feature of building a habit but they can't even get this one feature right. This is just a guess but I believe it's because of the second pop-up after you hit ""yes"" to rate your mood. Pretty useless additional feature.",poor
Not advisable and reliable. highly complicated.,poor
Love ticktick but the lag on the latest version of the mobile app is unbearable.,poor
I paid so much......can you remove the subtask...is annoying...lagging..hang...not the best anymore...extremely dissapointed....worse and worse...please..please...do a new update...,poor
I PAID FOR THIS YESTERDAY AND I GOT MY PREMIUM ONLY FOR ONE DAY??? TODAY I'M NOT PREMIUM AGAIN?? I had enough disappointment because my 2nd device didn't get premium after I PAID and now my first device also like this??? I emailed you since yesterday and also write on feedback on app but I got NO REPLY!!!,poor
"WARNING : steals data, Routes info to chinese servers before uploading to your cloud account. Check via NRF or Pocket SSL capture app. The good: simplistic UI, one may or may not like this. The bad: Google+ authentication is buggy, had to it thrice. The ugly: doesn't allow one to export/import data.",poor
"For a higher rating, pls don't force a response after a long hard day Also need more flexibility, or instructions, in opening, closing, deleting, ending..., i.e., managing tasks",poor
"I paid for two account on two different device, but at second device, my premium membership can't be used. I paid twice. But I only get one premium account!!!!!",poor
I am a premium subscriber for 2 months. I billed for October but my premium expired. And app support is not replying to my emails,poor
So much features require to pay to use! Evil money hungry developer.,poor
Garbage,poor
"Often freezing and crashing when I wanna add photos to task, help or give my my money back !!! No support response Tasks in calendar, easy prioritization, only usefull app in shop",poor
"If you're trying to build schedule it's a pain on ticktick, choose another app, -recurring tasks all move together when postponing one task -When editing or deleting a recurring task it should ask if you're doing it just for this task or all recurring tasks, instead of deleting and editing all tasks without asking. - when creating a recurring task I should be able to time it on different times for each reccuring day, instead of having to create the same reccuring task for each seperate day",poor
How do you sync? This is next to worthless unless you can sync.,poor
"I used to love TickTick for the combination of to do list and time tracking features. I upgraded to the yearly premium service a couple of months ago. About a week ago, the app started crashing and now won't open at all. I have tried uninstalling/reinstalling a couple of times with not change. I contacted TickTick through the app and by email and have gotten no response. I use my to do list for everything and can't have service issues like this. Will not be renewing. Looking for a replacement.",poor
I don't get a completion sound when I finish a Pomodoro,poor
"Decent amount of functions, and I really like the widget for this app, but the free version is too limited to be useful. I would pay money for this app if it was for sale. But I am never going to pay for a subscription to a phone app, especially not a todo list app.",poor
"I love this app but the sync stoped working. If I write list items on my phone (oneplus 6 - android 10) and after I open my desktop (win10) client than my phone sync to my pc. This leads that all my notes dissapire. I am coming from google notes, there the sync is nearly instantly, back and forth. I love to see this core function to be fixed as many others noted earlier. I also ""locked"" the app in the backgound tasks, and reinstalled. No succes for me. I will give 5* if this problem is solved.",poor
"Need the calendar view, but I'm not paying ongoing fees for it. Not enough tasks in the free version, account deleted. Shame.",poor
Worst app,poor
"This was a great app but keep making changes that make it worse. For example you used to be able to merge two tasks together, but now doing so just makes one task a subtask of the other, it doesn't actually merge them into one task and there doesn't seem to be a way around it. Edit - Also if you edit tasks on the web version (which is a quicker way of working around some of the apps flaws) it doesn't seem to synchronize with the Android app, I now have a real mess of old and new tasks",poor
"I wasted ₹1390/- hard earned money. Microsoft To do, is far better.",poor
"~$30 bucks per year, y'all have lost your minds. Uninstalled",poor
"This app never gets better no matter how I wait for improvements. One is it late notifications of your to do list. Now, it's always frozen, kindof dead or something. It great app but I'm not using this again.",poor
"I used to love ticktick. I have it on mobile Android and Windows 10 client. They used to sync beautifully. Around 23 Aug, the desktop client and mobile stopped syncing and acted like two separate accounts. In desperation, i reinstalled desktop client. I couldn't log into client nor thru browser. It complained of network configuration and proxies. i don't use proxies. I can log into any account online except ticktick. The help rep is unresponsive. Super disappointed. I'm on premium. I want refund",poor
"Installed this app, added the tasks, logged in using google in the same order. But after login the tasks added no more found. This is definitely unacceptable.",poor
concept is ok but I dont like ui it make me think a lot maybe the design is very clean,poor
Did not do what it said that it was going to do.,poor
I couldn't use this app... cause payment method isn't available.... it would be great if you add some more payment options like bkash...,poor
Useless without a paid subscription. Not even a weekly view is possible.,poor
"Many of options are in upgrade mode, so i couldn't use them",poor
"The features of the app is pretty simple and cute, so.. when it comes to the design it's okay! But.. that's not the purpose of the app, it's a reminder! And it never worked, oh! It does! At the first and last time! 😑 And it never works again! The storage of my phone had been wasted! 😒",poor
"When I try to complete my habits or swipe them away in the notification center, my entire phone freezes up for a few seconds. Other than that, its perfect.",poor
"I wanted an app for easily sharing grocery shopping lists with my partner. I shared the list with her, nothing came through and the app told me to upgrade to premium. No thanks - will pass.",poor
"The tasks don't show when I go to a particular date such as the next day. It says ""you have a free day"" even though all my tasks are set to daily( what is the difference between 'Daily' and 'Every Day' anyway?) I would also appreciate if the subtasks completely checked off once completed instead of showing the next date unlike the other tasks in the list. I thought that I'd found the app with all the features I need and was considering to go Premium but this has really frustrated me.",poor
"Was great till they added fermium garbage limits, and way overpriced premium with crazy overkill features. Got to love the apology to a review. It's amazing how far companies will go to not make a sale or a dime. 👋 I happily pay for services to store data or provide entertainment and apps that provide tools, but wow you must have some super users to garner 30/yr in value from a task app. I'd have been happy with ads or paying $10 once to get some small set of advanced features, but damn.",poor
Complicated mess,poor
To view your calendar you have to sign up & then after you sign up it say you have to upgrade & by upgrade they mean buy it for a month subscription or pay for a year. 😅 Can't really use it for it's intended purpose without having to buy it. I downloaded it because I was under the assumption that it's basic functioning was free. The subscription price is cheap but I'm careful which places I put my bank/card info as I don't feel comfortable putting any info about myself out there.,poor
Lost all my Gnotes information with no advanced warning. Years of important information all disappeared now call tick tick with no integration. Very poor and has caused huge problems,poor
For task duration you need premium,poor
Syncing in the background between Android and Mac hasn't worked for multiple months. Have to manually go into the Android app and do a sync. Doing a background sync on Android after every edit or notification that gets updated would be nice. Stop adding features and fix this already,poor
Terrible support. I purchased the yearly suscription and I got no answer using the Feedback & Suggestion from the app and neither using mail to get a refund. Scam.,poor
چطوری باید باهاش کار کنیم؟,poor
"I loved this app. I used it every day. But suddenly it won't share attachments! I get emails with pdf documents attached, and I used to open the pdf and share it with Tick Tick, and the app would be so awesome it would create a new todo with the pdf attached to it. Now not only does the app look different, which is fine, but I can no longer share the pdf files from my email to the app. That was the whole point of using it for me. I'm really unhappy. I also sent feedback through the app.",poor
When will Gant view come?,poor
Fewer integration with Google Account,poor
"App cannot sync in backround so it does not sync with your tasks created for example on your PC until you open it manually sync it. Very annoying feature and also making your tasks ureliable... Too bad, because otherwise it's perfect... P.S. I already has contacted the support, they sent me automatic reply and nothing has happened since...",poor
Good app,poor
"App is good, however, customer support is not that much. I have contacted them 3 times about an issue and the request is being ignored. I am really sorry that I have to give a low evaluation in order to finally get the attention of the customer support. I am a paying customer for 3 years now",poor
Asks me to upgrade just to be able to connect to Google task calendar. Uninstall.,poor
"Provided apk installed, looks a bit better, but still has some delay after click on Complete from push notification. UPD4: no tasks duplication anymore. Delay between click on Complete and task movement to completed tasks list still occurs. Same delay happens when I mark task checkbox fron the tasks list, not only from push. When I snooze task, no such delay at all. UPD5: app hangs on switch betw. tomorrow and today. I have not enough spaces to describe cases there, may you share issue tracker?",poor
Nice,poor
So bad i wish it blocked,poor
"Has failed to sound and show tasks at the right time or at all, yet still put the recurrence on for the day after. I have a reminder set for every two weeks but it went off after only one week so I took my medication too early, fortunately no harm done to me. Uninstalled.",poor
It was on my phone when I bought it. I have no interest in a trash app like this.,poor
"My experience is the exact same as Theodore's review below. Constant syncing problems with google making the app completely unusable. Started happening around the same date as well (around July 25 2020). I emailed the support team with a description and screen shots of the problem and still haven't received a reply. TickTick USED to be a great app but has progressively gotten worse, and now unusable. That's okay though, I've had to switch back to Todoist because of these issues.",poor
Can't import without signing up. I don't want to give up privacy!,poor
38/year y'all out your damn minds. Can't even view a full month calendar with the free version. Only day and week. Silly devs.,poor
"Worst app for reminder, period. Use google products instead. They will work no matter if you turn on or off the background use. This power hungry good for nothing apps are straight to be ruled out. Well if you don't believe me, give it a try and keep regretting",poor
"Absolutely refuses to not sync data with Google account. If I try to use a Gmail sign in I HAVE to sync everything with Google. The app will ask 500 times in a row regardless of how many times I hit ""deny"". Makes the entire app totally unusable. Changing emails is a massive pain in the ass if you already have a Google account associated with it. This is absolute garbage.",poor
"I think this is just irritating... Because I just planned my whole day and kept reminders, not even a single reminder came through the whole 24 hours.....",poor
"Poor, practically no functionality available in free version, even day view is restricted. Removing this app from my phone.",poor
Don't trust this. No uninstall information anywhere. Makes it feel scammy.,poor
"Update - the app is from Hong Kong, and after the recent Chinese law I urge anyone to stop using it. 😞 I use to love the app rated it 5 stars previously, But sadly nothing can be done. 😟",poor
"The in app calendar view doesn't show the tasks I've scheduled. When the devs responded to my 1st play store review, i thought they're going to fix it. But now, even after several updates, it's clear they had not taken my feedback with much seriousness. Uninstalling.",poor
Price not shown before creating an account.,poor
The tasks doesnt show up on time and it always overdue and i dont get to finish my important tasks. I have to find another one ... To do list app This app sucks..,poor
"Further to my previous comment, it looks like app is hanging on syncing. As same behaviour can be duplicated multiple times. First started happening on 7th July. P20 pro andriod 10.",poor
2.70 per month for a to do list app? Are you serious? I would mind an add banner at all and would find it fare I know you guys aren't volunteers but guys don't think that I am as desperate enough as to pay such a fee for to do lists.,poor
Expensive,poor
"Recent update broke sync, battery drain and constant crashing. Sort the basics, before adding fancy features.",poor
Chinese app👎,poor
"I set a reminder since last week. It didn't even ring at the chime of the clock while I observed. It rang post 10min approx, that too when I accessed the app to see what's the fault. Please look into this bug.",poor
"it's China app ,so don't use it if you love your privacy",poor
"At first oke, unless you don't want to give permission to Google.... Each time you Deny to share you're data, the question simply pops up 10 more times, hoping you click allow. This is pesky!!!",poor
Too many errors.,poor
The premium version of the app is good....But the free version is useless.. And some school students don't get proper support paying monthly from their family of my country. Every interesting and useful feature arw in premium...,poor
"Subscription based calendar, immediately uninstall it",poor
"Worst customer care, they can't manage a refund, I'm very disappointed. SCAM",poor
I bought the full version of gTasks Pro from this company and now it's unavailable. Think twice before buying from them.,poor
I don't like this app because...no protecting from this app..,poor
Reminders doesn't work,poor
I don't like this app,poor
Automatic synchronisation disabled by developers 🤕,poor
"Keeps asking for a rating. OK, here's one.",poor
"I found TickTick not satisfy me, failed to give me alarm on events for a week long testing.. 👎👎👎",poor
"Guys, This is Chinese origin copy of Wunderlist app which is Free of Cost & here they charge claiming for premium features. Not Worth!!",poor
Worst,poor
Do not work on time,poor
"This is a bad app. After purchasing a paid subscription, I got a lot of ads instead of an app that helps me plan my business.I hardly see the task scheduler, just advertising. A lot of advertising. The authors are too greedy.",poor
It's Chinese so fear of data security issues. Uninstalled it,poor
"They double billed me for my premium subscription and wont respond to any refund requests. I have been a premium subscriber for over a year, and changed my payment method from Paypal to Google Play subscription, but ended up being billed twice at my renewal (once through each method). I've reached out to their support email address (4 times), and haven't even gotten a response. This app is a good app, but you cannot trust them with your financial information or expect them to respond to you if you have a problem.",poor
This is the beat app of all !!!!,poor
I downloaded this app after hearing good things about it. I had todoist and my subscription ended and I wanted to try this. I downloaded it and brought over all my lists from todoist. After entering everything I uninstallled todoist (bad idea). I decided to upgrade ticktick to premium. Once I upgraded they asked me to sign in which I did. Upon signing in it deleted all the items I had in the app already. Contacted support. Haven't heard back from then yet. What a way to thank me for upgrading.,poor
It just vibrate I never get an alert. It only list the task and vibrate when I open the app. It doesn't alert me...,poor
Problem with login,poor
Annoys user to rate the app. Here's your one star.,poor
I can't sign in to my account,poor
You cannot delete the account from application for some unknown reason,poor
unable to login in all login options.. it says sign in failed check nw but nw is fine..am able to access internet..,poor
The app is really clumsy to use. I took the paid version of this app but still it feels like that the app can't help you with anything. It's better to set a reminder of your own. Money waste.,poor
#boycott chinese products shame on chinese president,poor
It's been a good app but I can't sign in now. I can't even renew my premium membership. I love this app but it's been like this for long. You will always be redirected to the sign in page everytime you sign in,poor
Waste of time,poor
Very bad app,poor
I purchsed this specifically for the pomodoro feature (among other features). It's not included in the app.,poor
"In pomo mode, White noise option gone or not easily found, at least to me. Tried web search with no help. Only silent or Ticking clock option seen, which is annoying. Cannot email customer service, url outdated through web link.",poor
The majority of things are blocked off by subscription.,poor
"When I try to set up avatar - photo on OnePlus 6 , I have black screen.",poor
"Awful support, unable to move re-occuring tasks before completing previous one, look up the definition of planning again.",poor
I didn't like it.. premium for month view?? really 😂,poor
"Does not work, reminders do not show up.",poor
Useless after,poor
"The date and time parsing is broken. It doesn't recognize "" set up meeting for xxxxx at 9am tomorrow "" It throws an error saying it's past due and sets up at 9 am today . Can you fix this.",poor
Earlier this app was working fine but now frequently missing to remind task on set time.,poor
Connects unasked with fb,poor
"Would be great if they would stop interrupting workflow to beg for reviews. Update: still begging. Also, isn't it a violation of Google's TOS to specifically ask for a 5 star review? I thought you could ask for a review, but not tell people what rating to give.",poor
This app doesn't work the way we won't. It doesn't notify after even permitting it.,poor
"Whole other to do list apps provide muce more for a normal user for free, you are just greedy minded pushing everything to be paid.",poor
It won't let me remove my subscription,poor
"Unable to subscribe. I am from India. I think this might be the reason. Whenever I click on pay, it shows ""Unavailable for this purchase"". I have tried using different debit/credits cards. Still same issue. If I open in desktop, I can pay using PayPal. But while converting dollar to rupees, it shows more money than it shows me in android app for subscription price. Also I feel, 1300 Bucks for this is a bit pricy. But seeing American economy, and price in dollars, it may be cheap. But here costly",poor
"Did you delete my previous comment?? Ok, one of the reason todoist is better than ticktick is I cant register my email which is an active and also my primary email. Been few days but I still dont get the verification email yet ask me to change email instead. So thats 1 of many. If you can help me on this, I might consider to try it and give u more stars.",poor
Bad and have ads,poor
VERY GOOD APP BUT IN WIDGET THERE IS A NO OPTION IN LIST WISE SELECT TODAY TOMORROW OR ALL PLEASE UPDATE FOR THIS OPTION THEN IT WILL BE FAR BETTER PLEASE UPDATE EXAMPLE IF THERE'S A CALL LIST IN WIDGET IT SHOWS IN CALL WIDGET LIST ALL CALL TODAY TOMORROW OTHER ALL DAY BUT IT SHOULD OPTION TO SELECT TODAY TOMORROW ETC.,poor
"Its not good app because it's not accurate like I set 9:15am when the time reach that time it didn't get notification to me after 9:15 like 9:17,18,20,25 like that",poor
I dont like this,poor
It's not a good app I don't recommend it everything you have to pay for .,poor
"I've used this app for years on several models of Galaxy phones. Very unreliable for reminders. It even has a built in notification that pops up saying ""reminders not working? Do this...."" But the instructions make no sense and don't match the menus of my phone. Uninstalling now.",poor
The application looks nice and simple. But the synchronization between mobile and desktop version is awful. A lot of pictures from tasks which were added via desktop version are not accessible on mobile and vise versa,poor
Some of the crucial features are premium only,poor
"Worst Experience Ever. I signed out, & All of my Tasks list Gone.... Login bar doesn't even showing what email it was. And I don't remember my email. I was going to buy this App, but hate now. Don't have any way to backup my list.",poor
Worst ever had,poor
I can not change my font size..,poor
RUN FROM THIS HORRIBLE APP. I wasted three days trying to get it to work. Duplicates list when importing. App charged me over $150.00. Worst customer service. This is a terrible app. DOES NOT WORK TOTAL RIP OFF,poor
Just another app with a subscription based service.,poor
Useful function require paid membership. Doesn't solve the purpose,poor
it doesn't work |:,poor
"I had previous mentioned a glitch in the wedgit, it's been 5 months and was told that a team was working on the glitch. So far there has been no improvement. It's a good app without appropriate maintenance hence the bad review.",poor
"This app is horrible it was working well at first but when I tried to edit my list titles and add more lists but, it never worked no matter how many times I tried, and trust me that was many, many times. This app is very annoying and over all very useless.",poor
I just want to make a checklist 😩. Couldn't figure out how,poor
"Kept crashing, rss feed if my calendar duplication of entries was HUGE and overall it just added to the noise rather than helping.. I'm out.. UPDATE: No I can't send a feedback (with log) as I've already unsubscribed and uninstalled the app.. and that's surely something you can add into functionality if you're really interested in gathering the data",poor
"Want to know that is there any feature like wunderlist app, to get notification of comment on all shared members on their app as well as on email.",poor
"Max of 9 lists, then you pay 3 bucks a month.",poor
"Pesters me to rate it, immediately one star.",poor
"Requires creating an online account to view the calendar. Therefore, there is no reason to use this over Google Calendar.",poor
The free version is crippled. 3 lists max. Seriously? Just use DTG GTD. To do app with free unlimited nested to-do lists with tags and reminders.,poor
"Very good app that is perfect for how I think, but it kept asking me to rate the app for months now and I've always pushed Later, I'm sick of it asking me to rate the app",poor
"Help! The widgets are not working. It always shows this message"" failed to display your tasks, please restart app or add a new widget instead""",poor
"Nothing is free, very bad",poor
"Another app that fails to draw events correctly on day view If I have an event from 3:00 to 3:15 and another from 3:15 to 3:30 there should be drawn with a space between them no matter how much I am zoomed in, they are not overlapping events so don't treat them like they are",poor
"while using the habbit feature, you can add multiple reminders for drinking water, but if you check done in any one of those reminders then it wont remind for the rest of the day. ruins the logic. Uninstalled Installed a year later and still the issue exists, the habit feature was a unique point which brought me to the app but I guess I'll have to use another one.",poor
Update 2/19/2020: I cant recommend this app to anyone. The smart date parsing only works reliably if you enter it using military time. Also the fact that you have to enable alarm mode to have reminders fire on time is ridiculous. I have many apps that push notifications on time and don't require that. So the developers don't know how to do reminders correctly. Horrible app.,poor
"Downloaded ticktick. Thought it seemed cool, so signed in with google account and tried to sign up for monthly subscription. Kept getting error messages and it wouldn't let me start the process or even add a card. Waste of time.",poor
"JUST PURCHASED MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION. UNTIL NOW, MY APP IS NOT WORKING AS A FULL VERSION.",poor
One of the worst app...if someone believes in this app.. for sure they are going to miss that appointment..,poor
"""Sorry you have reached the use limit on subtasks. Upgrade now and add up to 199 subtasks per task"". Are you serious guys? Pro version for more subtasks? Why 199, why not unlimited?",poor
Free version only allows 9 lists. Lame,poor
Cant even understand how to use it..didnt like at all,poor
"Cannot share entire calendar and/or task database with other users. Only single daily task shares or individual list collaborations. Edit: very solid low 1 star, 0 if I could, since the developer couldn't even be bothered to read the entire of two sentences of review, acknowledging what features they did have.",poor
You block new entry on my existing list and force me to upgrade to premium if I won't to continue.,poor
No subtasks,poor
"Only reviewing so the app stops asking me to do so. Even when I do review the app still asks me, 3 stars to 1.",poor
I keep adding tasks. Its nit showing on widget. Very complicated to use.,poor
Not Good App All u Need buy and clock facility not given,poor
I have used this app for years but there is now a major issue. If you drag a task to tomorrow or place it under a task with a later date the task date no longer changes date. Is there any way to revert to an earlier revision? Hi I have sent screenshots but the issue is the same.,poor
"for years I use ticktick, I love it so much, I rated it 5 in Play store.. But the recent several changes to the app are make the app getting worse and keep getting worse than before. I incredibly sad and disappointed. for years I rely on ticktick as my todolist app, and now I have to find other alternative that can be as good as ticktick that I know before. that's not an easy thing to do",poor
"You need to pay. It's uselles without paying. Seriously, just 9 list for free?. If you need more list just add them in wunderlist and then import them to this app. Or better, stick with todo from Microsoft, it's free.",poor
It keeps showing java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to start receiver com.ticktick.task.activity.widget.AppWidgetScrollable: java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke virtual method 'boolean java.lang.Boolean.booleanValue()' on a null object reference at android.app.ActivityThread.handleReceiver(ActivityThread.java:3421) at android.app.ActivityThread.access$1300(ActivityThread.java:200) at android.app.ActivityThread$H.handleMessage(ActivityThread.java:1684) at android.os.Handler.dis,poor
"Only 9 lists allowed for the free edition. Incredibly expensive by app standards for the pro ($37 per year). I don't mind supporting a good product, but that is ridiculous for a shopping and task list app",poor
Very expensive premium...,poor
Apps that cost should be required to disclose how much these cost up front so people can decide if they even want to download it. We shouldn't have to hunt for the cost.,poor
Can't assign to multiple people. Verry bad !!!,poor
I have been a big fan of Todoist for years. I tried this last week and the themes are awful .,poor
Very annoyed by the new time setting. It's like going back to Android 2.1,poor
The reminders do not work.,poor
"why do i need to pay for basic features such as showing your tasks in month view? it's a calendar app, those are stuff you need to see... can't believe you need to pay premium for a calendar todo app to show your freaking todos in the calendar",poor
Widget has stopped working and the developer is unresponsive.,poor
SERIOUSLY??? Just realised you made Duration a Premium Feature. Why? Did people just start using it more all of a sudden???,poor
New update has performance bug very slow in scrolling down and typing Update: after last update now i cannot type or write anything in task description after markdown features 👎,poor
"I cant no longer recommend this , cant sign up on any platform and they servers are located in Asia .I wouldnt put any sensitive information on it. They have nothing but server issues . Its very fischy",poor
Update: noticed this app sending data to Facebook when I set up my firewall. No bueno.,poor
Worst app I qm trying to create acount with gmail but it say no internet connection Even my internet work fine every thing working nicely even you tube without lagging,poor
Doesn't allow you to unsubscribe from premium and the developers don't even respond whether on email or twitter.,poor
Awesome,poor
"It's impossible to use this app. At first, when I choosed pink theme during onboarding, the app ignored my choice. Then I filled it with all my tasks for two days, but when I closed it and opened again, the app asked me to sign up with Google. All my tasks were gone when I did it! I`m deeply disappointed...",poor
"Deleted my account because I found something more aligned to my needs, but I still got charged for another year. Developer ignored my email and then denied a refund via PayPal so I've now paid $28 for something I can't and no longer want to use. Had no issues with the app itself but very disappointed with the customer service.",poor
"Cancer notifications. I denied the app permissions it asked for one time when trying to change the notification sound. Now it is impossible to change or mute the sound, no matter what setting I change inside or outside the app, and whether or not I give the app the permissions it wanted. 4 stars when this is fixed.",poor
Markdown causes laggy typing in description and it seems I can't disable it.,poor
Want upgraded version even to set the duration . Pathetic app.,poor
"Was good, but has recently been persistently bugging me for add'l permissions including to my Google account. Uninstalled it.",poor
Um you need to pay for the duration of the task? No thanks i will just find a new app,poor
"Horrible now. Was good to start, but now that my subscription expires December 1, cannot even accomplish a simple thing like removing tags from Task names. VERY DISAPPOINTED.",poor
I don't understand why the App has all the languages except the Arabic language?,poor
"No reply to my TickTick Premium cancellation mail, since 2 days. --------------- New update, another day has passed and no reply to mail has been received yet.",poor
Wastage of time,poor
No pomo time more than 1hr. No whitelist available. No feature for tracking task progress. Also add the feature to quit bad habits.,poor
Tried my level best reminder ringtone is not working,poor
"Guys, need remind alarms! I need sound! Message is not enough. Not for subtasks. For TASKS. They haven't sound. Only notification If you can help me solve my problem, I am buy premium",poor
Not very helpful,poor
Not good looking and hard to manage tasks,poor
"I gave up trying to learn how to use this app. It's not intuitive. I can always find a ton of options, except the one I'm always looking for. Plus once I figure something out, I can't remember how to repeat what I did after a couple days. Today I downloaded a different app, and so far, it's a lot more intuitive.",poor
Not user friendly. So many useless functions . Complex to use.,poor
I absolutely adored this app until the most recent update. The task nesting feature is far too sensitive and becoming a real nuisance. I emailed the developers about this issue a week ago and sadly received no response. I'll be cancelling my subscription until this issue is rectified.,poor
"Thought this might be a good alternative to Microsoft To-do, but most of the features are locked behind a subscription.",poor
"Please fix the new sub category feature. I am a paid yearly subscriber. I love this app and I loved being able to drag items item or arrange their listing. But recently my tasks either just get lost to oblivion, duplicate themselves for some reason, or when I try to rearrange tasks by dragging them higher or lower so its more organized, it will just end up becoming a sub category to a different task. Then I have to take out time to figure what happened to the task, where it went & fixing everyt",poor
"Features are really awesome but the app takes forever to open. By the time it opens up, I have already lost the task to be written. I opted out of premium after getting so tired of the app freezing on my phone and on the web. Again the app has really good features but the performance issue is a killer because the whole point of a productivity app like this is to get things done. Would give it a 5 star when this gets fixed. Please look into it and solve this churn problem to get your users back!",poor
"Some tasks do not stay saved on the day I completed them, so I can't keep of track them. I have the ""Show Completed"" option on.",poor
It is very great app but the sync feature is terrible. I have to manually sync every time. Sometimes the notification doesn't fire (12 hours later) because I created a task on the computer and it didn't sync in background to my phone. That's useless then.,poor
Widget sering tidak muncul kegiatan hari ini dan harus tutup buka baru muncul,poor
افتضاحه و حال به هم زن ترین برنامه ای است که تا حالا دیدم,poor
Promising but not up to the mark. List order changes randomly. Many bugs. User experience is poor. Microsoft To Do or Todoist has better user interface and experience.,poor
Why can I not select calendar anymore when making smart lists?,poor
"I love this app's design. However, the fact the monthly calendar is only available for premium users is very disappointing.",poor
"My phone freezes up everytime I complete or snooze tasks whether it be through the popups or just through the app itself. Edit: after the last update, nothing has changed, and in fact, this issue has gotten worse as I slowly build up my number of tasks. Every night, I tend to reset a lot of reminders for the next day, and now my phone almost always freezes up for a good 2 minutes and then hits me with a ""close system UI"" which then turns off my phone for some more time. 2 stars now instead of 3",poor
Major Bug in the latest versions... when pressing backspace in an empty check item... the cursor moves to the above item BUT IT DELETES ONE CHARACTER AT THE END OF THE TASK TITLE.,poor
Made promo worse there's no count down just has 30:00 and when i exit the app the time (color ring) resets it's self is this a bug,poor
"I like the features of this app and it was working quite well. But the last few weeks, it does NOT play the notification sound. It triggers and I see the notification. But no sound. This is really not good. I'll have to look for another app.",poor
The alarm is delayed :'(( it's not working anymore,poor
Really clean and seems to have a lot of good features but I got this app specifically to make grocery shopping lists to share with my husband. I have sent him the collaboration invite multiple times and the list has not appeared in his app. The collab feature goes not appear to work.,poor
"App is great for making lists and adding details etc, but reminders simply do not work. I've adjusted the app settings to allow reminders but they never show up. If they worked I would have rated it higher.",poor
"Was working great and I use it across desktop, Android, and iphone. For last few weeks though it does not sync, will not update to iohone, and freezes repeatedly on android so as to make it unuseable. Freezes when sel3cting or adding items. Can maybe make one change now before it freezes. Every time. Will be looking for a replacement app to use.",poor
"The App is great. I paied for premium account and transaction done, but my account still basic and saying failed to verify even google play confirmed the payment. I email the contact email with no response.",poor
New update causing app to freeze. Pls correct it immediately.,poor
"I'm sure the premium might be fine, but all of the most important features are locked behind a paywall. I wanted a simple app that would let me set repeated reminders on my phone, but this surely isnt it. At first, it told me I just needed to sign up to do that, so I did, but then it said I needed premium! Very misleading, I immediately uninstalled because that is just untrustworthy behaviour to me.",poor
I can't use it because I must to pay and be premium that rude 😒.,poor
"The latest update has made my mobile sync completely non-existent. I even uninstalled, cleared junk, restarted my phone, and re-installed, but that actually made it SO much worse -- the app now thinks I'm horribly behind on repeating tasks that I deleted months ago.",poor
"No notification is showing nor any alarm. I would have given a five, but what's the benefit if the app is not working its main functionality? I don't get any notification when the app is not running in recent apps.",poor
"I think this app retarted my samsung tab S3 SM-T825Y itself. I had reset my tablets just to know what was my problem. When i reinstall ticktick, it started restart again. Like malware or something. Please fix.",poor
"I can't say how much I loved this app before. Now they're making it 'Messier' by badges , etc. It's a professional to-do list app please leave it that way.",poor
loved it until the last update. now the widgets don't show. just a blank white block that says problem.loading widget. please fix.,poor
tick tock plaece,poor
There is a limit to the attachments that can be made.Not a substitute for wunderlist,poor
"Can't attach photos, says photo too large on Android, and on iPhone it just fails",poor
Slows down my phone big time,poor
Ugly all white ui themes make almost no difference. No option to keep completed tasks in list. Sync is unreliable and does not even notify the user when unsuccessful. Service is down right now per their Twitter but app shows no errors; sync simply doesn't work. Web ui is extremely bloated and runs an unacceptable amount of client side scripts. Still better than the new Google tasks though.,poor
"After the task time is over, the app without giving the relax time shows that the relax time is over. It usually happens alternate manner.",poor
"Do not like this app it's confused me, I certainly don't need help getting confused from an app I do well enough on my own.",poor
"Annoying! Terrible. I keep going in circles when it tells me to ""sign in"". And when i want to schedule something, the steps r confusing. Never again, until they make it better.",poor
Great task app BUT it will auto reformat your typing and you can't stop it - this is a huge problem.,poor
"Excelente jusqu'à lundi, depuis seul les rappels fonctionnes à priori, l'appli ne fonctionne absolument plus.",poor
"earlier this was a very good apps, suit for me and my activities. But after I installed it on my PC & change my password, the apps on my phone keeps telling me to reset password from web (even though I already did it) :( so now I can't use it on my phone coz every time I try to open the apps, it always making my phone restart",poor
Eh....not great for an expensive app. One of my important tasks went missing. I asked for help but response hasn't produced the lost task yet...,poor
nur 9 listen erlaubt in kostenlose version,poor
"I really want to subscribe for premium, but the purchase options are not available, tried alternative option. It's showing unavailable.",poor
Thought the UI was clunky and unintuitive. I bought their premium based on an MKBHD video -- I will be cancelling today.,poor
All basic features are paid and the free features are very limited...Very disappointing..,poor
"I love this app and has great potential , however it seriously flawed with sync issues and as such i cannot rely on it for my appointments or task due dates . Sometimes i create a task , then move it to another date time . When the sync happens the task disappeares from calendar and goes back to original date.",poor
"If you keyword search, there is no sort. You end up with search results in random order, which is basically worthless, at least to me.",poor
Not intuitive,poor
"My biggest problem is that there's no free trail and a lot of stuff is behind the pay wall but I'd like to try before I buy. Also, as a first time user there's a few issues: I downloaded it on my tablet and landscape mode doesn't work well for all pages (especially the habit details page). There was also no tutorial so I was left to just click around (when I later downloaded it on my phone there was a tutorial so I'm not sure why there isn't on my tablet).",poor
کامل نیست,poor
"I'm at awe how the tick tick guys keep managing to destroy a perfectly working app by having to redesign it every once in a while just for the sake of saying that they're keeping the app running. Now I can't delete the messages because it's almost barely visible once I push the three dots or lines on the tasks and there is no way to scroll the choices to see the delete option. Please, for the love of gods, don't work so hard to ruin a perfectly functioning software. I'd love to ask, just why?",poor
It wasn't enough good because Lot's of its features was unavailable.,poor
Limit of 9 lists total. Are you kidding?,poor
Devs tried to send me a link in the review comments which I can't even copy let alone open from my phone because their apps is too unintuitive to use without a manual.,poor
"It was okay in the beginning, but it's shortcomings are becoming more glaring with use. Also recently the habits simply disappeared recently and the pop up for check in is annoying. I paid for the premium and won't be renewing for a second.",poor
All my tasks have been moved half an hour forward. Very annoying.,poor
It was ok before. Now it changes the stuff that I enter. Please fix.,poor
"The program is very good on my old phone(galaxy note 4), but notifications don't work on the new one(redmi note 8 pro). I hope you will fix them. Thanks",poor
Premium version only,poor
Good,poor
برنامه ی خیلی خوبیه. از همشون بهتره.ولی جا داره ک بهترم بشه,poor
"As a user of GTasks (owned by TickTick), how do I FULLY synchronise my data with the cloud (preferably Google but will make do with the TickTick servers). I pay for this service but only 40% of my tasks are backed up on TickTick server/cloud. Any and all advice much appreciated. kind Regards John Collington",poor
"This has the beginnings of a great app, but lots more work still needs to be done.",poor
"Very hard to use. Cannot get a list of task to do, until do date",poor
Good but the paid version did not work as I wanted to use it more so I was disappointed,poor
Works well but free version only gives you three total lists,poor
Reminders doesn't work.,poor
Missing everything good about gtasks and adds everything you hate about every other task list app.,poor
Didnt like that to really use it as a planner I had to upgrade,poor
Having issues with syncing with Google calendar. I added a task on TickTick and it's been over 12 hours and it still has not sync up to my Google calendar. I've tried refreshing but nothing showed up. I've looked at the help forum and many people have the same issue for some time now. I just purchased the pro and it's not worth it if it doesn't sync.,poor
Add a feature that let's me tick tasks off from the widget. Either than that I love the app,poor
"Good, bt nt what I was looking for.",poor
Can't post to my google calendar or any other subscribed calendars. Disappointed because this app has promise.,poor
"I found developers lie about free features. I just turned into day view, I asked to login and then I asked to upgrade! In description this option and several other options mentioned as free.",poor
"Tasks that I change dates does not move to the new date assigned. I'm dismayed because I am a premium member. Moreover, it doesn't have a 1 week or 7 day folder. Apart from the calendar, I also want to see a 7 day list or folder...",poor
C'mon. To have more than 10 lists I've to pay!? Nope... That's not gonna happen,poor
"I liked the app notifications when they worked, gotta pay 2.99 a month? Crazy....mbe a year? Not a month for a calendar app. Most widget features wont work unless u pay, never got to see if they even were worth 299 a month....i like the popup reminders, hopefully someome will make a free one.",poor
widget is not working completely. It does not sync with the app. Plz solve this problem,poor
"I don't know why they changed it, but I hate the fact that you can't type in the time anymore. You have to scroll, like you're on Wheel of Fortune or something. That is the biggest pain in the behind ever invented!!! I don't mind it if there's a option, but this doesn't appear to give you a choice anymore. Please change it back.",poor
"From all possible options I've tried out, this has most awkward and unintuitive interface.",poor
"When u want to add check list this will help you out. Instead of writing some where, u can add them out here. But in the case u want to develop it as a habit, then u have to changes the setting and activate habits mode... Even in that u can create only 5 habits. If u want to create more than 5 habits, u will be asked to update to premium version Only 5 habits thats funny, if its atleast 10 then okay...",poor
Night mode doesnt show up under theme,poor
"Had been very good. But now any reminder that is not completed by the end of the day gets marked as complete inatead of showing up as overdue. On repeating tasks, sometimes marking today's as done will also mark 1, 2, or even 3 days into the future as done, with no pattern behind the glitch. Has become very cumbersome to use and has resulted in many tasks getting missed.",poor
Quick Add got fixed. Now the sync is broken.,poor
"You asked me to pay premium version but instant Google calendar sync still doesn't work, needs few hours for tasks to sync. This been an issue for years already and you ignore pleas from users. On the other hand the Gtasks app you have works really great.",poor
"Perfect app, except for 12-hour sync with Google calendar",poor
"Getting annoying, reminder keep jumping out although the task is set one month later. Start Looking for alternatives",poor
"I love the feature where you can type the timing in the name of the task. This app has great features but one thing doesnt seem to work. ITS THE REMINDERS. I'm neverrrrr of my tasks. I never get the notifications. I tried everything that was wriiten in the ""reminders not working?"" But it still has not been fixed. Could u please look into it asap",poor
"Loved TickTick - great interface and the widget was perfect. Unfortunately I had to move on to Todoist. TickTick doesn't have Alexa capabilities and that's a deal breaker. For a while, IFTTT and Gmail provided a good workaround, but recent changes to Gmail rendered that functionality inoperable. TickTick, get on board with Alexa and I'll come back.",poor
Reminder is not working in Realme phone. I did all the settings in my phone and app settings but still not working.,poor
"After update, I couldn't log in to my Google account, the button Allow wasn't working. After applying the workaround and setting an email in web-version, my app on the phone requested permissions to my contacts. I allowed it, the pop-up in the app did not disappear. After pressing 'ok' several times, it went away. However, now the app doesn't fetch the information from the cloud. I wanted to buy Pro, not anymore. You can't fix the bug with Google account for several months now. Embarrassing.",poor
not backup in device offline ??,poor
"I downloaded and paid for this app several days ago. It has some good aspects. But now I literally HATE some other aspects of it! For example, if you set a specific time for a specific time (e.g. 1-3 pm), it DISAPEARS without giving you a chance to do anything with it. So, if you didn't finish that task, you are out of luck if you want to move it to somewhere else! How ridiculous it is! I'm really scared. I can't trust this tool. I have to switch to something else and cut my losses.",poor
Please fix the widget. It keeps failing to display tasks and asks to restart all the time,poor
"Disappointing... I have been happily using this application for years now, but the last few updates appear to have caused more problems than they fixed. One example: when you create an event that's further away than a month, the app will AT ALL TIMES change the date and time to incorrect ones. It has done this EACH time for me over the last months, changing the dates and times for no reason; you can imagine this is a deal-breaker for a planning app...",poor
"£3 a month to use most of the app... Na. Features are nice, but Disappointed I can't just buy the app.",poor
Now when I get a reminder it wakes up the screen to display the notification. There's no way to change this. Edit: reminder pop-ups is already switch OFF.,poor
"Easy to use and understand. I have an issue with the reminder settings, if I set a time reminder, then it drains my battery. So I am not able to use this function. Otherwise I am happy.",poor
The free version is garbage compared to any.do. every other click pops up premium warning and it's annoying as hell,poor
Best to do list app except the new notifications have gone haywire. They only pop up at bottom of screen and then disappear if I open any other app. Old standard Android notifications would remain in pull down notification drawer until I dealt with it - far superior. Please bring that back.,poor
"Keep getting a pop up ""Re-authorisation failed"" even though my Google account is already authorised on my account",poor
"Has been one of the best reminder app available for a long time. This most recent update messed up notifications on Android 10. They don't follow the system dark mode at all, instead you have to manually change it in the app or deal with mismatched colors. It looks ridiculous seeing a white notification background amidst other black backgrounds in dark mode. It also looks like the black is not a true black like other apps. If this isn't fixed soon, I'll be looking for a new reminder app.",poor
This is very good app but the monthly cost or yearly cost are not worth it for me. I found a free app that does tbe same things.,poor
"I really like this app, it's one of the best reminder apps there is. However the new custom notifications are horrible! It sticks out like a sore thumb. You have to manually set between white or black background, which means that they don't automatically switch with Android 10 dark mode. They're also not black, but grey which makes them look ugly next to other notifications. Title and time also don't line up with other notifications. Plus it says ""a min. ago"", which is only accurate if I look at my phone immediately. And it turns on the screen when the notification comes in, even if it's in my pocket. This is a great app, but the recent update is one of those 'if it ain't broken don't fix it' moments. I really hope you consider going back to standard Android notifications, or at least provide an option between custom or standard. I'll gladly update my review to 5 stars if that happens.",poor
"The new notifications are useless to me. I always keep my phone on vibrate, and the old normal Android notification would vibrate my phone and notify me on my watch too. But now the new notification pops up silently and is very easy to miss. And I've tried changing the settings and nothing works. I really don't understand why not use Android's build-in notifications instead of this new thing or why is there no option to turn it off?",poor
I would've switched to TickTick but there is no option to change to a 12 hour setting from a 24 hour. 😔,poor
A very good to do manager. I would take a premium version if on the Windows version it would possible to set/change/manage location reminders. For this feature I already wait some years. I'm really surprised that the programmers are not able to add this feature also at the windows app. It's annoying so anoying that you have to edid every task in Android again to add a location reminder..... But it seems to be to difficult for the programmers...??? So when this is to difficult what can we expect? Will the maintanance of the Windows app stay on a reliable basis??? Waiting already since years for a change. Didn't know why the ask me to change settings on Android to change place reminders on my Windows TickTick... May be I should give up 18.10.2019,poor
When i share my task on whatsapp Even though i selected share title and content It only shares title Version : 5.2.2 & If i share my task in the form of image the task with long name The end of the name gets replaced with ... Instead of showing the remaining heading on new line,poor
"In general I really like this app but every time it does an update or my phone restarts, I have to go to redo the battery optimization settings because otherwise I don't receive notifications. This is just ridiculous that it doesn't save my settings! 3 months later and still have the same problem...",poor
Loved this app until it stopped syncing... My android app and web app have been out of sync for over 2 weeks,poor
"such a scam.....!!! first it asks you to sign up for making duration related reminder ,once you sign up it says that you got pay money for that features 😑🤦‍♂️... deleted this app at the next moment of seeing those scam stuffs",poor
"The interface is ok. But TickTick does *not* sync with Google Tasks. (You can import Google Tasks, but no tasks added in TickTick app will appear on Google calendar.) If a task list doesn't integrate with Google Tasks, if I am limited to using the standalone app and *cannot* see tasks on other devices / computers, then the task mgmt. app isn't really good for anything.",poor
I think this app is the best option for a to do list except that the sync is terrible. I just paid for premium and the app will not sync. During the trial the sync between android app and PC app was also very bad. If they could get the connection/sync issues fixed it would be a great app. If I can't access the premium features I paid for in the next few hours I'm going to be requesting a refund...,poor
All the main options are charged. Then why list the app for free. Might as well list it as charged app,poor
"Useful. But constantly calls out to access crashlytics, Facebook, etc. Too much spyware. I'm searching to replace it. App also locks you in so you cannot export to another app.",poor
TUTORIAL ?,poor
"great app for your phone but if you need smartwatch functionality, look to Any.Do rather than this app. In dialogues with the devs, theyve stated they have no intentions of integrating even simple WearOS apps (like add task from watch). Uninstalled",poor
"There's a bug with the planning view, you can't see the title of the event. Other than that the app runs okay.",poor
Great app but isnt optimized for google Pixel 3xl. i cant re-size the widget to match the size of the screen.,poor

"It was good for a few days, but now it's not loading on my browser at all (Gateway timeout), and changes I made on my iPad are not syncing to my phone. not useful if nothing works.",poor
fix the lag on moving events on the day display and I'll subscribe again. ux is clunky get a second opinion,poor
The app is a little confusing in the way it works and it is a little ridiculous to pay $3 a month just to see a calendar.,poor
App seems ok. But they want you to pay a monthly fee just to use a basic calendar. It let's you view the current week. Anything else and you have to pay. So many free ones out there to choose from. Uninstalling.,poor
i wish there was a one time payment option and a dark mode i can't add another subscription to the msny i already have,poor
"i love this app but it reads my texts. i left one in draft and it suggested it as a Todo item. i couldn't find any way to get it to keep is ""eyes"" to itself. not about it.",poor
The notification on my Tickwatch C2 has no vibration 📳 please fix,poor
"Now not working after pie /EMUI 9.0.0, please update or give instructions, still not working, no option found in settings, please help as guided",poor
"the application is very nive but cant take the complete use of it because of the premium option , and the amount also is high",poor
Serviceable but not awesome by any means. I've spent enough time trying to set up tasks in here that I feel like I can't bail even though I don't love it. It's really tricky to figure out how to make tasks show up like I want and have only been able to really get things set up right by using the website in addition to the app. Nothing is intuitive or easy to figure out in this app.,poor
"Works well. Does more than I need. A little awkward setting up reminders. 4/24/19 UPDATE: New app update forces me to read how long ago was the task due and then it shows what it is. Very very annoying. Will be looking for a new app if they don't fix this. 4/30/19 RESPONSE: Pop up notifications show how long was the task due, then what it is. And I mostly read pop up or slide down from the top. Disabling Countdown doesn't solve the problem.",poor
"Non-functional with Google account. Was great, but can't use right now.",poor
TickTick please give us students a discount like Todoist!! You lost a user!,poor
"The app is good but the differences between the premium and free version aren't mentioned at the beginning. It is also not possible to start using the app without the ""free trial period"" as far as I have seen. After the forced free trial period I now realize that the sync function which enables you to use pc and and. app simultaneously is indeed a premium function. This seems awful lot like the way Evernote took, I want to buy my apps because I appreciate the work, not because I'm forced into.",poor
I love this app but recently it has been freezing every time i add a new task. It's updated and i even reinstalled it yet it is still happening.,poor
it's just a simple to do list ... why did you locked some tools ..,poor
I'm facing a problem that is reminders are not working properly (device Lenovo k3 note Android 6.0,poor

"When you use the pomo timer, it automatically starts counting down when you hit what task you want yo be working on. There is no longer an icon where you can choose your white noise before starting the pomo and no way to pause the pomo once it starts so you can select your white noise. I would like to be able to select the task I'm working on, select what white noise I want, and then start the pomo; not everything automatically start.",poor
Came back to this after not using it for a while Tonnes of updates has made it rubbish,poor
mota moti...,poor
Requires access to contacts to work,poor
Do I have to add tasks daily? or can I copy whole list for daily?,poor
"could not get any realtime notification at all. enabled all notifications, android6.0 or higher option, disabled battery optimization and other security settings. The only time i get the notification is when i manually open the app itself, but then it has already been past the time set.",poor
premium is very expensive,poor
The features are good but unfair to pay on yearly basis,poor
"Nice app but one feature that makes this app less sense to me. their recurring tasks is unnecessarily complicated i.e next occurance of an event totally depends on completion of current instance.there is no way to mark a task incomplete. despite ive a premium subscription i cant use because of the messed up recurring tasks. after your suggestion, im seeing all overdue tasks as completed :(",poor
"Good idea, but I don't like that it wants internet access.",poor
"Not too good for Android! I have the App in my two different type of phones and subscribed for the premium one month in my Android and found out that that version doesn't have all the features described as for example impossible to find or use the sub task feature, create or editing folders, etc. etc. Very disappointed about that, because the App concept seems to me very good. :(",poor
"The basic app is fine. Not great, but fine. However the premium is far too pricey. £27 a year for the ability to set a duration on tasks? That's crazy.",poor
"I just installed this app on my droid today.  When setting up my account I signed in using my Gmail account.  However, I am unable to do that on my laptop.  I get an error message when I input the Gmail address and password.  I was looking for a replacement for Google's Inbox.  I would like something that is accessible on both my phone and my laptop.  I guess I need to keep looking.",poor
"I just spent 30 minutes putting tasks into the app, then went to sync the app with my google account and they all got erased.",poor
Task management is terrible. it will kill the apps running to draw over the screen. frequently my camera shuts off because tick tick notification.,poor
anything with a dash creates an alert which is troublesome to remove. eg. practice weeks 1-3 turns into a due date of January 3rd,poor
"Says free, its not free. Its a demo for a paid app. Be warned.",poor
Very confusing,poor
"Glitches galore! Currently am unable to see certain options at all, as they are blacked out. Tried deleting & re-installing, resetting phone, & changing the theme to different colors. It's a shame because this is my favorite to-do app & was just thinking about biting the bullet & upgrading. :( If fixed, will definitely reconsider.",poor
"App works pretty well, but if they want me to list out all events and plans in my life, their Privacy Policy needs to get stronger and be better defined. ""We collect your data; here's a vague description of what. We keep it as long as we've decided we need to; and we won't tell you how long that is. We also completely change this policy in a way that we're break the Policy you may have originally agreed to, but it's your responsibility as the user to make sure we don't break our end of the deal. Don't like this? Delete the app"" .. basically the Privacy Policy. Not exactly trust encouraging. Fix this in a privacy friendly way and I'll change my review",poor
"App has everything I need, but there is 2 major issues: 1) after reverting to standard time all scheduled dates moved to day before (I'm in Belarus, Belarus doesn't revert time as against Europe does). E.g. I had repeated task on Tuesday, and now it's scheduled on Monday. 2) Web - Android sync.  If I change something on Web, changes don't appear on my Android device. If I change something on Web, then open Android app and look through tasks, then refresh web page, all changes done on Web are lost. It is completely unpleasant and the only reason why I can't buy full version.",poor
"Well, just one of many reminders. Has one big drawback - cannot do what it designed for, i. e. REMIND. Really missing about Astrid.",poor
It's worst app,poor
"Honestly the premium version is just not worth it, what's the point of having advanced calendar views and event setup and calendar import if, in every case, you can't see future recurring events? (The next event in the list of recurring appears only if you have ticked off the previous instance) In order to use a calendar efficiently for planning you ought to see what events are next, this hindrance has been made present by the users as far as 2015 (as I'm seeing online) and nothing has been done, that not only shows poor hindsight (what's a calendar without planning) but also a strikingly deaf customer service. The app is probably just as good as its free version, the pomodoro timer is ok, but the extra features are just not worth the expense for the premium version.",poor
The features that were used to convince me to install all require premium access. Will not buy something with so little real use testing.,poor
User Interface not friendly,poor
Not good. No option to edit tasks (or correct spellings) once entered. Setting time and date not intuitive. Too many steps to make a single entry. Many other drawbacks. Not recommended.,poor
"Another crappy todo list app I have to delete. I dont understand, all I want is a simple to do list!!! I keep trying to add an item, and it automatically goes into my ""inbox""- whatever that means. I went to the ""help center"" to find a solution, but a long list of topics that isnt searchable is completely useless!!!",poor
Add option remind at specific location instead of time only. If this is already there can you please educate me how to use that?,poor
Simplicity but not too simple like Google Tasks. Even the free version is alright if it would actually work as promised. The attachment function is EXTREMELY flaky and unreliable. I lost important pictures as I thought they have been secured into the cloud but they haven't or just half of the picture. No error message was given when uploading via Android. Without the attachment feature TickTick is nothing special compared to similar apps so I deinstalled it.,poor
"This WAS a great list app. Then something happened and I stopped getting notifications. I checked the app and it said I needed to allow permissions due to Android 6.0. I've been on Android 7.0+ since I started using the app, but regardless, I checked and permissions were set and allowed the app to provide notifications. Still didnt work. I've tried resetting the phone, resetting permissions... nothing works. Now I'll try uninstalling it and using something else.",poor
It's good if you're willing to spend so much money. How Annoying.,poor
"I used to find this app helpful but lately it's been malfunctioning and is super annoying. It sounds the notification even when there's not a task, and it's been doing that more and more. I even tried to make the alert noise silent but it kept doing the sound even after I changed it. Made sure every single thing was changed to silent but that didn't help. It's also stopped popping up the notifications when I DO have a task so I often miss things. I'm going to be uninstalling this app and finding one that actually works.",poor
"When i remove all app in recent. I didnt get any notification about my 
event but if i will not remove this in my recent app it will notify. I want 
it run or notify me even i close the app and remove from my recent apps",poor
"This app is hard to understand. Tasks are deleted without warning or they 
are not saved. Several times I thought I created a reminder only to find it 
wasn't there. I've missed appointments because of these issues.",poor
"Needs at least 1 more level of subtasks to work for me and no restrictions 
on number of subtasks.",poor
"Almost perfect. If the app just have Hejri calendar integration like Google 
calendar",poor
"Since installing it, it's needed updates every day. I just think software 
shouldn't need daily updates.",poor

times.. 3 times i had to add them again.. Going to tasks now.. Much better 
app!",poor
"Its Ok. It has the only decent widget in any todo app, but it lacks 
integrations with much of anything (no Google Assistant, no Wear OS, no 
IFTTT) despite pages of user requests on their site. Severely limits it's 
usefulness beyond a very basic Todo list on your phone. Also, you can't 
bulk delete completed tasks and the developer said they have no plan to 
implement that?! Finally gave up waiting for the app to grow up.",poor
"I LOOOVE this app! It would give 5 stars, if only it would work😦. It's 
been bad for crashing for months, but I put up with it because I use it so 
much. With the last update thigh, it's even worse. I can't put the widget 
on my phone, it crashes everytime I try, it doesn't give me my reminders

stars!!!",poor
"This application does not pull or push to your Google Tasks you have to use

looks like it's doing something useful, then nothing happens. I've looked 
and I don't see any setting that I'm screwing up or anything and the 
default functionality of the to do list probably shouldn't require you to 
change something for something to show up anyway. Glad I tried this before 
renewing my premium. I'll go find another app.",poor
"The widgets require a Premium account? Please mention this so that people like me, who want to try the app with the widget, will know to look for another app.",poor
I hate when you say that it's such a great app and I download it only to find out that you only get the bare basics for something that is advised as FREE. I could only view one week and the rest of the features were extremely limited as well. Waste of time.,poor

17.10.2020. Have nested multi level sub task. But not easy to add it. Have to open a task and got the menu to add one. Adding Sub task is easier in apps like My Life Organized or Dynalist. MLO dont have a web version. Dynalist dont have reminder if i am not wrong.,neutral
"Great app, but… It is a ridiculous problem with nesting subtasks: it's done too easy unintentionally when selecting a task. Then, the task becomes hidden till I scan all the sibling tasks. When finally found, there is no simple way to unnest the subtask to the root level. Please please fix the selection feature making subtasking more explicit with a larger drag threshold. Bug #2: cannot paste a text in the problem reporting form. It only allows to select and copy the placeholder text. Why?🤔",neutral
Tiktik was the best. But the last 2 version is not good at all. The text of Havit prompt is very large although I set the text in small. And recently the remainder time is showing in the notification panel as an alerm icon of the default alerm app's icon . Please fix it.,neutral

Even though I've removed all battery saving options on tick tick and also given it permission to autostart and run in background, this Pomo function still keeps malfunctioning. Kindly fix this issue.

Great app but for months the auto sync on collaborative lists is broken as of a recent update. They still haven't fixed it. Confirmed on several devices,neutral

"It's good app, but not great. I use it on my phone and tablet and it's great for keeping track of things that need to get done. But it doesn't sync between devices well. You have to manually open the app on both devices to get to sync, which completely bypasses the purpose of the widget.",neutral

Not so good without premium :(,neutral
"Bizarre task app. You add a task and then tap some strange icons like tags etc. that seem to do nothing in particular, then you send it to an inbox for reasons unknown. You then have to click through two more screens to tap it again just to add a reminder and set the time. To make all that official there's a tiny check at the top of the screen to tap. Then, nothing really. No confirmation or summary, nothing. You have to double check that you got it right. Also, updates do nothing. Laborious.",neutral
"Hey, I love the app but I think you need to slow down on the feature adding process. I am not sure I like the idea of tick tick transforming into a note taking app. I have other apps for that. Developers want to put everything in their app but that just adds to the clutter.",neutral
The upgrade if it was free that well be special,neutral
جيد جدا,neutral
What a pity to finally found wunderlist alternative app. However I can't use this beautiful design app because there is no notification for all the activities in any sharing list except directly mentioned that person name. How to mention everyone name in every comment. Come on dev. You can do such a great job so far. This is just a setting to receive notification. Receive all or just for be mentioned. Wunderlist becomes the best because of user feedback. Don't let the world down 🤣,neutral
"Amazing app, but ufortunately, all of this functional tools are not free :(( I couldnt add more than five habits :( need to upgrade to premium. Hopefully, for next update, this app could be give more benefits in tools :)",neutral

"I really want to love this app. It seems perfect for me, but unfortunately the reminders don't go off unless you go into the app.",neutral
App is good but habit notification doesn't make any sound,neutral
The free version does just about enough for my requirements but no more; limited sharing and reminders are less than generous but it works well enough.,neutral
Lots to like but Inbox doesn't work as expected: adding dates to tasks does NOT remove them from Inbox so all your tasks stay in Inbox and it's impossible to organize. Please fix! This conflicts with your support site guide,neutral

Sync could use real work. Needs a manual option for when working with multiple devices. Other cloud services can be seen to work immediately on a second device. There's zero settings for synchronization.,neutral

"I noticed a slight anomaly in the app. If you start focus for a subtask e.g. SubtaskX of TaskX, then why isn't that focus time added to the total time of TaskX? That SubtaskX does fall under the TaskX, so any time invested in SubTaskX should also be added into the main TaskX otherwise it defeats the whole purpose of SubTaskX if it is independent of the TaskX. I hope you will 'focus' on this issue. Thanks. ●Edit1: The app has a lot of useful features but they are often hard to find. Simplify it.",neutral
Not as smooth as I hoped,neutral
"Some good features but overall mediocre compared to my old Wunderlist. If someone shares a list with me I cannot easily join the list. The list is not auto synced with my profile. Instead I'm sent an email with a ""join list"" button. But even when I click the button I am taken to the generic sales page to download the app.",neutral
"Failed to meet my expectations since it is a Editors Choice. Like to say good but not user-friendly, I would like to say. Can't set reminder easily. I think It's too innovative to follow.",neutral
"I love this app because I could set the widget transparency bg so It would appear neater as a whole with the phone wallpaper, but when I press a task complete, the list that I made then all gone on the widget saying I have no task today, I experience this on daily basis and in the end have to open the app to make edit on task and etc hope this bug could be fixed soon.",neutral
It is great app for civil engineers like me as it helps me to planout my to-dos everyday. But the thing is on my realme x2 pro the alarms are hit n miss even after following instructions for keeping it active. Pls fix it 🙏,neutral
Best App. pls allow to add upto 10 Habits in free version 😅,neutral
I love the app but I am unable to login on my new device. My internet is working fine 😑,neutral

Nice app,neutral
A Call Reminder feature is absolutely needed.,neutral
It's a good app for reminders,neutral
Sometimes don't show reminders.,neutral
Ok,neutral
No doubt this app is amazing. And this app deserve 5 star but I am frustrated because this app doesn't keep log more than 90 days. I wish it could kept forever.,neutral
"Just as I was about to rate this 5 stars, it only let me have 16 ""subtasks"" It's stupid. Let us have more ""subtasks"" and I'll give you guys 5 stars.",neutral
"It's a good app, there are many amazing functions, but there ads are very annoying",neutral
Good for a long time but recently it became unusable...it would always freeze up.,neutral
"I love this program could be 5 stars BUT... a task adds Tick Tick to the shared text in the paid version. This not good and means you have to remove it every time! WORSE IS THE Developer response I got below, clearly indicates they do not understand usability issues reported from good users. "" You can remove the TickTick information manually."" REALLY!!! Not a good suggestion for a productivity product.",neutral
"It seems nice and simple, it has proper instructions! However there's no option to save it to SD card, and I need the space on my phone, so I'm likely going to have to delete it.",neutral
The app is not compatible to read my notifications on my wrist band.All other apps notifications do work.All settings are set on my phone to make sure i receive the notifications but in vain.Please make an update for this.(Any update on this issue please),neutral
Lately from past two days I am facing difficulty using widget. Getting an error 'task list not found' whenever I strike off a task. Please look into it ASAP.,neutral
"Everything fine, but don't have email reminders.",neutral
"I love the app! However, I absolutely hate that I can't change one reoccurring task time and duration without changing the repeats after it. Please fix this!!!!! This app would be way better if it had this function like Google calendar does!.",neutral
"FYI, Adding more reminders is not free. You need to buy the premium version.",neutral
"Decent, used to be better! Now the tag stays on the text entry line so you have to manually erase the tag between each entry. Very annoying! I went back to notepad and pencil after this update",neutral
No transparent theme,neutral
Only the premium version is good,neutral
"PLEASE FIX THE SCHEDULING THAT CHANGES TO Jan 1st 1970 when selecting any day, I can only schedule using the Today, Tomorrow and Next Monday buttons, not the calendar, this was present for over 2 months by now. Also, smart text detection doesn't work at all for "" on tommorow at 6:00PM "" for example. Please fix these 2 issues.",neutral
Widget is slow,neutral
"I simply love TickTick but am growing weary of the widgets not updating. If I open the app, they update after a minute or so. However, if I don't need to use the app (therefore not opening it), the widgets stop updating after some amount of time. Is there a setting I'm missing, or do I need to ""not optimize"" TickTick's battery use? EDIT: In addition, actions taken via the widget do not update the app/website until i open the app explicitly.",neutral
It's ok. A bit messy.,neutral
Too much options getting me confused and more complexity,neutral
This app certainly has some really great features which others competitiors don't. Clearly have potential to be the best in the market. Cons - Sync issues Time to load up in windows 10 Bugs in habit tracker & tasks.,neutral
I cannot login to the app,neutral
Only allowed 9 lists for free. Need to purchase for additional lists...such a bummer. Wunderlist was much better but I had to switch over as they closed. Tick Tick is not so straightforward to sync with another user.,neutral
Monthly widget needs to be premium:(,neutral
"I'm really enjoy your app, but where is subfolders? This is very useful feature, especially for GTD method. Launch this feature please and I'll change my rate at 10 stars 🌟",neutral
"I newly installed this app, it works basically good but I haven't been happy with its user interface. For example, there is no feature showing all weekly or monthly tasks in a table. I would like to see my future plans at one glance without scrolling down!",neutral
"Excellent 👍 application, but I wish to add Arabic language, thank you.",neutral
"Most probably its my choice since Wunderlist closing, but why are you guys so persistent in denying email notifications feature?! App really often skip reminders.",neutral
"There is too much WHITE everywhere. what happened to assigning colors to folders? Add some more theme colors like purple please. The latest update added color to the calendar widget for events, can you please give us the option to choose the colors? Also please bring back the old completion sound. Lowered rating because your Android Wear app hasn't been updated since 2015. Please fix to work with 2.0. I really love this app but may have to move on if it won't work on my watch.",neutral
"Good app. It will be better if the user could set duration of task . For example in reading or studing or every task which need to be more focused on it . I use ""flip"" App beside Tick tick app for this purpose. Thank you",neutral
"Calendar integration is okay but buggy and quirky. Can't see calendar events in daily view without changing settings to show in all lists. Organize view can't use custom lists to plan my week. The sync with Google is unforgivably poor. If I change a calendar event it takes up to a day to reflect in TickTick. This is so bad I have begun looking for replacement. I would like to see a better support forums for community feedback. Often answers are basically ""suck it up, that's just the way it is"".",neutral
"So close to being my dream todo app. It claims to support Start Times but actually doesn't. You can record the start and due time, but you can't then filter a list to only show a task that has in fact started; i.e. what can I work on NOW. For me this makes start times nothing more than a tag, that I can't interact with, which totally defeats the point.",neutral
"Lack of experience between platforms, premium purchase not synced very well.. some good points like custom alerts and reminders.",neutral
Why not find Arabic language,neutral
"I've been a long time fan and user of ticktick but man, I have to say, these past updates doesn't really feel right. Sure, it does look great but my weekly tally of focused hours is gone. Before the update, viewing of stats offline wasn't a problem, but now? come on guys. Also why did you remove the weekly focused hours and made it a premium feature? That's just so sad.",neutral
the new update has removed the repeat task option I don't know where to find it,neutral
"What happened? Since your last update, every time I drag items to a different time, or different order, as soon as I leave the app, they go back to where they were. Please fix this. I want to set the order. Also, the Google calendar items after the end of July are missing. Does the free version no longer sync with Google calendar? Nothing there after the beginning of May.",neutral
"Всё отлично, но не работает таймер Помодоро:(",neutral
"Smart todo app. 1) Location feature needs cell towers option instead of gps battery killer. 2) sorting needs many levels e.g. by location, then project list, then date. 3) priority needs 1 to 99 list items tasks where due dates are not important. Very good app otherwise, the cell tower function could be like, a button to capture connected cell towers IDs for say 5 to 60mins, then tasks are triggered if phone connects/disconnects to one of the saved tower IDs. Different locations have",neutral
"So much potential. Still learning but loving it. CON: when tasks go to Notification Bar I have option to mark Complete or Snooze. When I tap on either, it freezes my phone for up to 10 to 12 secs. Sometimes get UI isn't responding. WHY?",neutral
"Better than Microsoft To-Do, Google Tasks, Boosted, Wunderlist. But still not great because it does not have the simplicity and app task/event logic I am looking for.",neutral
ok but it's not different as my phone's app,neutral
The statistics show I missed everything in a day even though I completed 90% of the tasks,neutral
Good,neutral
Decent todo app for single user. Home screen widget does not receive remote updates,neutral
3rd May 2020: It was very long time back.. requested for the feature to enable notifications for the actions done by shared members which still I am waiting for.,neutral
You need to make a clear all data or reset everything button. I had to delete my account because it triple synced and I wanted all this mess gone and I couldn't. Please consider it.,neutral
"Good basic lists, i would like to create more lists, but the annual fee for unlimited lists is too out there",neutral
"Good app but very complicated/cumbersome UI. You have multiple places where the tasks can get hidden & then you'll forget, which defeats the whole purpose. Simpler design would help greatly. Going to switch back to Google Keep soon.",neutral
This is good app,neutral
I was little starting to be comfortable comparing to other app..unless the premium came up.. I don't any personal ac to pay just to get reminded 🤧where multiple remider doesn't work..i literally start loving and hate at the same time..u can't get multiple unless u get premium..:) this ain't my app,neutral
Thanks for this apps its fells great,neutral
"TickTick is not a bad app by any means, but it is too complicated for my needs, so I just went back to using Google Keep, which also has an excellent sync system with its website equivalent. TickTick is especially complex when it comes to the scheduling of alerts, which always confused me to the point where I didn’t understand how to set the reminders that I wanted. TickTick is a fantastic app, but it is quite confusing. I prefer simplicity in the note-taking and reminder apps that I use.",neutral
"Jury is still out.....would be more than happy to review.....if i was actually given the time to do so before the ""rate me rate me"" messages.",neutral
I have just started using this app and it looks great - except for the drop down menu from the 3 dots which doesn't show the full menu and you cannot scroll down in it either. PLEASE FIX THIS!!,neutral
"Nice up. The only problem is price. Prices are the same to first world and third world. They don't have option to poor countries only for the rich ones. They don't have even option to students. The product is good, but there's no equality. Sad.",neutral
need some options and need to be more organaise,neutral
"I paid for a year subscription based off the demo, having not used Google's own, free, task manager. Big mistake. All I needed was Google's free version of the same thing, in fact they are almost identical. Moral of the story don't pay for this unless you are in extreme taskmaster.",neutral
Please make a more sleek widget please...,neutral
"It's impossible to sort completed list, it's very inconvenient, I'm waiting for this feature for 2 years wo any hope for a success",neutral
I can't scroll the widget or other screens. I'll probably subscribe if this gets reliably fixed since Wunderlist is dead now.,neutral
"Has the potential to be an excellent all in one calendar and to-do list, however I cancelled my subscription two weeks in as: 1. Subtasks automatically repeat when repeating main task is completed, regardless of time and due date settings. This should be optional. 2. Subtask reminders should be optional 3. Calendar functions are very limited, e.g. ability to set up an event rather than a task would be a valuable addition",neutral
Pomdoro is bad,neutral
"I needed a replacement for Wunderlist, which we relied on for task lists for our business & employees. With TickTick, I had to manually type in each task for each list because the Import feature only put them in my Inbox. There's no Home Screen - hitting the return arrow exits the app (not a biggie, just an adjustment). The real downer is having to pay to share the lists with more than one person. Collaboration was an important feature we needed. Using Microsoft's To Do for now.",neutral
Can add a reminder option withthe specified time,neutral
Unnecessarily complex. A simple one dimensional version would be fine,neutral
It's good but it's size is large,neutral
Jus started using. So far I like it.,neutral
"Useless. Edit: thanks for replying, I wish the tasks could be repeated every day like in a morning routine that is done everyday to give the user a sense of having a productive morning or something :/",neutral
Very helpful with lots of features. I would like to see the countdown mode work on the widget too though. Also it would be delightful if we could add tasks (like the notification) with a button shortcut such as pressing the home button for some time and the prompt would pop up! But still nothing I would pay annually though..,neutral
"This is a good app, however it has a few bugs that need attention that could easily make the app 5 stars.",neutral
Just upgraded to premium version. App and Google play list subscription at $27.99. I got charged $29.84. ???,neutral
"If time tracking was added and the parser/interface of the ""what would you like to do?"" field was fixed (this alone is making me want to switch back to Amazing Marvin), I would rate 5 stars.",neutral
"does not work on galaxy watch...It would be so perfect if it would. The app is the best though, but how can an app built for planning and reminding not work with something as basic as a smartwatch. Makes no sense.",neutral
Nice one,neutral
"Great app but missing integration with goggle assistant or automatuon apps like IFTTT, many apps do this now ticktick is falling behind",neutral
"Hi, im using the paid one on my phone and ipad. However i find that they do not sync well on both. Like i already marked 3cups of water on my phone, then whem i open on ipad it's not marked. But then both updated according to the ipad. How do i make this better? Also, can there be a way to skip a habit? Sometimes i missed it and i dont want them to keep appearing on the list.",neutral
It could have been a robust app but these bunch of loosers want you to pay every month is annoying.,neutral
I have the premium version. I had been using Wunderlist. The most amazing Todo app ever and very intuitive. Tick Tick has worked well as Wunderlist is no longer supported. However some key things I truly miss. Push notifications when someone texts within the app. Notification that someone else has updated or completed a task or list. Copy and paste everything I need into a section as a single item in the list instead of everything becoming its own item in a list.,neutral
Experiência muito boa mas tem muito a ser feito.,neutral
"So far, it's okay as task apps go. I'm a Wunderlist refugee because Microsoft bought them out (and they destroy everything). Perhaps Tick Tick will grow on me. We'll see.",neutral
در زبان فارسی به علت راست چین بودن تقویم ماه از راست به چپ ولی ایام هفته از چپ به راست چیده شده و تطابق ندارند. لطفا اصلاح کنید.,neutral
Good as it is simple and effective. It could be more enhanced.,neutral
Good app but in free version they should add more features just like reminder with time duration. I like it's feature of description in which we can add sub task and tick then.,neutral
"Generally good but has issues, adding a subtask is just weird - why they can't do what wunderlist does with a place to add or a button, and it's all a bit sluggish with some redraw problems. But it has some great ideas to it, so maybe it'll be good in time.",neutral
"Hi. Long time TickTick user. Unfortunately the app still has big issues with subscribed LOCAL calendars. Recurring events from the local calendar are doubled in the list view and have been for a long time now. The last time it worked properly was in 5.2.1. I notified you guys a long time ago, but it hasn't been fixed. I finally tried Any.Do and it works properly with my LOCAL calendar so it seems that I will be giving them my subscription money this year.",neutral
Back button doesnt work,neutral
Ticktick is one of my favourite productivity app but suddenly the habit tracker doesn't work or respond properly.,neutral
You have to subscribe for the pro version. I'd rather just have one flat fee,neutral
Love this app. I used to give it 5 stars but its so sliggish on the s8 and half the time the widget wont load.,neutral
Too many items,neutral
I would buy if there was one-time only purchase. I can't pay monthly. And it's still enough to use without premium but I want premium and one time purchase :/,neutral
"All awesome except widgets. They randomly (and annoyingly often) stop working, phone either needs to be restarted or widgets re-added (or both)..",neutral
"The best looking todo app I could find, very complete. Would be the one I use but... Unfortunately sync with Google calendar takes hours, up to a day. The issue seems to be a couple of years old (you can check it in the customer section on their website), and nothing was done to address it, while the competition syncs in seconds. If you don't need Google sync, then it's great. I'm now using another app. Sad.",neutral
Nice app but can be improved upon in terms of navigating the app,neutral
"Amazing, I started using this recently and I regret that I didn't use it any earlier",good
"It's a really good app, it help me manage my time better and know what I'm meant to be doing per time = more productivity. Only downside I've noticed is if you set a recurring task(let's say everyday 'egg' comes up) and you don't mark it as complete, the next time 'egg' comes up and you do it, you can't mark it as complete so you have to find the place where you didn't do 'egg' and mark it as complete to mark today's own as complete as well Maybe there's something to curb this, I don't know yet",good
amazing!,good
"because of this app, i could organize my time. From morning to evening. Go download this app!",good
"I've had an issue with a Habit since May. I tried contacting support by email, opening a ticket via the application but no one was helpful. It's a shame that such a good application has one of the worst customer support team. Update: the issue was finally resolved",good
"when sorting tasks via list, if they also sort the individual list items by time, would have been more convenient",good
"Nesting looks to work much better now (with a way to even revert easily). Still wish there was an option to turn it off, but I can live with it the way they've got it now. Great app, good for Any.Do users or folks still sore about Wunderlist.",good
"Satisfied, better than the most of the apps in this category",good
Very helpfull does a very good job. When typing an action or notes its very slow on an lg smartwine phone,good
Самое лучшее приложений для управления задачами. Но ограничение в 99 задач в списке - это полная глупость,good
"the reason I chose this app but not the others is because of the way the reminder works , I considered the upgrade but it's expensive for me as a student and no one time payment, hope there'll be student discount",good
Very good app but please update in widget,good
It's very useful But I hope becoming free,good
Very good app,good
"Nice app, useful for to remember tasks",good
"It's really the app that I've been looking for. But it would be nice if there was a tab for a customizable timetable and that the features to add multiple attachments became a free feature. If these are added, it would be the perfect app for most people.",good
Perfect,good
Has so many bugs it's keep crashing,good
"In timeline view widget, please fix presence of free unused space on bottom and align the event caption to the length and width PLEASE",good
It's a good app I do use it alot but there are problems with it like if you put 2 or more reminders in a habit the notification won't work. And my other problem is with the premium. If you have money you can have better features and during these times you would prefer to save up. But the app is great I do recommend it.🌻,good
"I had a greiveance but it is resolved, other than that the app is good.",good
I think it's a good app.,good
Multifunction app that help you remember everything and anything and force you to be more productive,good

"Dear TickTick please add the 'redo and undo' option, because it's absence I can't recover my just cut data which cut by mistake during 'copy-paste' procedure. Please add this feature.",good
Well performing,good
"What happened??? This app was working great until this latest update. Now it's losing tasks left and right. Lost 4 today!! Please back out this latest update until it is properly debugged. Update: Other reviews gave me a clue to what has been happening. It's creating subtasks! I now have 5 subtasks I never wanted, and linked to totally unrelated tasks. Further Update: Sliding is what is creating subtasks. It's too sensitive and it's impossible to NOT slide while pressing to select a task!",good
good but no have arabic language,good
Its been amazing to use tick tick,good
If only it had a dark splash screen. I have set the dark theme in the app to keep it easy on my eyes at night. But that bright splash screen just ruins it. I know that Google's apps do the same thing and it's absolutely stupid.,good
Best,good
It will be nice if the week calender view open in free,good
"This app helps me stay sane while working from home, juggling errands and work. It frees my mind from trying to remember what I need to do and focus on the task at hand. However, I'm experiencing occasional issues when using the pomo timer.",good
Great app but why not improve sync function on Wear OS. I have to buy another to-do app only because it has better support on Wear OS. So please improve it and make me only pay for this app.,good
"5.8.x crashes STILL. 5.7.2 works. Habits widget improved but lacking. NEEDS ALSO SINGLE COLUMN LAYOUT for habits widget. THE GOOD: 1. Habits. 2. Pomo timer. 3. Dark theme. 4. Sorting lists (only Paid). THE BAD: 1. Too expensive to use basic features. Make it $10 lifetime. 2. Social aspect lacks. Needs public leaderboard (OPEN to free users) & search find & add users. 3. No backup feature. Use Titanium Backup. Share option ok but only one list, need full backup export all. 4. Need 100% offline.",good
"Habit reminder suits me best. Streak feature good. Easy making notes. At first it took me some time to figure out the app, but now m able to. The tags thing is a bit complicated. I wanted the learning tags for eg, to appear in today list when i make them that day, but it doesn't. Otherwise good. Calendar feature and snooze feature awesome",good
It's good for handling,good
Great app.,good
cool apps,good
Nice app. You can organize tour day. You will not forget things anymore,good
Not to be confused with TikTok a clearly inferior alternative.,good
"If there was a way to set a recurring task, 5 stars. Overall, great app and love the layout - very functional",good
"Decent. Todoist and Any.Do have a bit better features, especially the Premium versions.",good
"could not live without it, it's simple but has everything I need (I would buy a premium version if it was a one time purchase, not a subscription) + I'd love to see consistent design between platforms",good
I wish it would give mote puch and be little More user friendly altogether a great app,good
Nice app,good
notes are great idea but without end-to-end encryption they are useless to me.,good
"I'm using this app for Notes and it is almost perfect except it can't create subfolders, please add this feature and it would be the perfect Evernote replacement.",good
"This app helps you to get productive by reminding you about the tasks you need to complete. Howey, there is a lot of room for further improvements. There should be quick mechanism for setting the time and date for the tasks. UI can be much better. There should be goal setting and habit development mechanism.",good
"I love the ability to see my to-do items synced with my Google Cal. That way I can drag my tasks to whenever I want and plan my day out. The only reason I'm giving the app 4 stars is because recurring google calendar events show up multiple times (in the same day) on the calendar view. I contacted their customer support, they responded: Sorry there is no setting for that. But I will note it down as a feature request to our product team for future consideration. It's not a setting...it's a bug",good
I use this app all the time with great benefit. 4 stars instead of 5 because of crappy support when I had a technical problem with the app.,good
"Excellent app, has taken all the information, but after buying the premium app began creepy lagging, switching tabs and leaking lagging, use impossible, support still not answered.",good
Please add 2 way sync to google calendar with minimal delay,good
Simple yet effective,good
"Very effective app. It pushes you to complete your task you entered in the app Have timers, which is the best too. Amazing app .",good
One suggestion: I hope the widget can adapt to system-wide dark mode.,good
"I prefer this app because of a cleaner UI, and pomodoro timer. But in terms of features it loses to todoist and other apps. For example when you past link it stays ugly, in other apps it transforms to smthn meaningful",good
So so,good
Functional features are very simple and effective to use. Not combersome. Great job,good
It's a amazing app but when I add task from Windows its not automatically updating on my Android widget (I have to open app to update),good
Very nice app. Ben using it for years.,good

This is the first time I'm sticking with a to-do list kind of app. So far so good,good
Great app! Life is so much easier. Only thing missing is a public API and support for automated backups. Please let me own my data!,good
"Pretty much exactly what I was looking for. Time entry can be a little bothersome as it uses the analog clock, but otherwise great.",good
"Great app so far Could be a little more engaging though with pop ups, trophies, animations when you complete a task. However it does help to keep you on track with your tasks.",good
This application opens slowly when I click it.,good
Enjoying this app,good
Great way to prioritize,good
Could you please make sure that the cases postponed to tomorrow retain their positions,good
"1. It would be great if you have the “auto delete completed tasks after a certain time” feature in the widget. 2. Show the task that have been accidentally ticked for a couple of seconds so that I can undo the action. I know I can do that in the app, but it's just more convenient for me if you have this feature in the widget.",good
Nice app. Easy to use.,good
App is great especially pomodoro mode..can u include a click to count the no of time taken to study in a day etc along with that,good
Love the design of app. Please provide export options. (Reason for not giving 5 ⭐),good
Great,good
Good so far.,good
Nice app,good
Best Task app out there. Only thing it's missing is 2FA to keep accounts safe.,good
تطبيق قائمة مهام ممتازة للأمانة ، وايضا يقدم داخل التطبيق تقويم وايضا هناك اداة لصنع عادات ، ولكن كل الميزات ومن ضمنها قائمة المهام والتقويم وساعة التركيز يمكن الحصول عليها من تطبيقات اخرى لدي . لذا سأفضلها على هذا التطبيق,good

the pomo in the ticktick website doesn't register the pomos: I can't seem to see any pomos from when I'm using the website in the pomo stats section in the app.,good
Alhamdulillah it is a nice app but It's reminding timer is not accurate. Most of the time it doesn’t work on time. Please fix it. Thanks.,good
Would have loved to give it 5 stars but the alarm does not works properly sometimes. Changed all required settings but it still misses some alarms. Other than that its the best to do list app I have ever seen. And the pomodoro is just awesome.....,good
"So far I've really liked Tick Tick. Simple and easy to create, schedule, and organize tasks. I really like how habits are integrated too. Please add some more features to habits. Let me put them in calendar view. I work mostly in the calendar view so it would be so amazing to have the habits there instead of having to create them as a task as well. It seems redundant. Please let me put habits in lists or tag them.",good
نمیشه برای صفحه رنگی انتخاب کرد برای همین یه ستاره کم کردم وگرنه خیلی خوبه,good
Pomos don't vibrate my phone,good
This is nice app,good
It's amazing ok I was really happy with the ability to create list and then a task and furthermore a subtask with a customizable reminder for each However the problem start there when you turn off the pop-up notification and only rely on the regular notification panel it just shows the the subtask name with no additional infos of the main task or the list not even the tag or the customized color is included with it I really sometimes find it difficult to identify the subtask hopefully you fix it,good
👍,good
Nice,good
"Quando digito data ou tag o texto do comando fica na tarefa, por exemplo: ""estudar today #rotina"" | Templates: O atalho pra editar eles podia ser mais visível e ter a opção de apagar tudo de uma vez. Inbox e botão de pesquisa: podia ter a opção de acessar eles na Tap Bar.",good

Bulk voice Sms broadcaster improvement this feature in your aap plsss,good
Actually like the new pomodoro statistics update but the bar chart has a flaw. I can't see the exact number of hours but rather an estimate because the exact hours aren't written onto the days like they were before. It'd be great if you could fix that otherwise love it.,good
It is truly amazing app for productivity. I wish to give 5 star but many features are not available in the free version that's the reason I'm giving 4star.,good
"Aplicación fácil de usar y muy práctica para el manejo de tareas, que ofrece herramientas útiles para crear rutinas y administrar mejor el tiempo. Sus opciones para planear, recordar y planear tareas ayudan a que estas no se dejen de ejecutar por descuido. Para mejorar, tiene la forma en la que se visualiza el formato enriquecido.",good
"I'm a ""to-do"" list kinda person, I rely pretty heavily on them because my memory is 👎 I like that this syncs with my Google calendar. I also like the satisfying little sound when I check a little box to mark a task complete (what can I say? It's the simple things in life 💁‍♀️). I especially like that I can schedule tasks and reminders waaaaay the heck ahead of time. Would've given 5 stars, but honestly, I'd really like a little more text options (fonts, colors, etc).",good
So far it does what I need,good
For habits statistics please add graphics of weeks and months progression,good
Good,good
"Just what I was looking for! Simple lightweight app that syncs my to-do lists a between Android, Windows & Mac. Very nice.",good
Great app 👍 could you please add the option to view habits on the tommorow list.,good
Achchha app hai magar kabhi kabhi dikkat aati hai.. usse fix karna jaruri hai,good
Some lag in sync but otherwise good,good
Pretty good good app. Does what I need it to do.,good
Routine tasks if not finished are shown as an overdue....!! Please give an option to auto mark any specific routine tasks as incomplete rather than overdue....!!,good
Works great. I enjoy having it available on my phone and on my work computer.,good
Bring the Gantt view,good
"This seems to tick (ha!) most of the boxes, multiple to do lists, habit tracking, Pomodoro timer. The only place I wish it were better is in statistics and graphs of habit and to do completion",good
That is really useful for me. I can use it for many plan and to do things and doing chores and ... . If U can add note (for writing notes and ...) And something like goal planner and program manager it will be more useful than now. TNX,good
It's amazing apart from the fact that it reminds me of you events from yesterday.,good
"Very very very good program, it provides to me all/most what i need to Manage My Aims & Planing for my dreams..📊📃 It also Enhance my productivity along the time bec. it has a full view about my own time [Days, Weeks, Months, Years] 📆 I'd like to purchase the program Premium Plan in the future if i started to use it almost.😊💳",good
"Good, few tweaks to be great",good
It is need to support Arabic language,good
Pretty good app. Helps get things done. Easy to use. No issues yet.,good
Pretty good.,good
"It could make some more features available for free versions,so it would be the better.",good
This app was really good So Far this is the best app I used to stay on track BUT I hate it when I need to pay for premium. Please make it free?,good
"No doubt it’s the best productivity app. It is very smooth and customizable. I liked the idea of adding a Pomo Timer & Habit tracker. Having all this features made this app unique & amazing. But the prize of the premium package is little high, that's why i'm not gonna give you 5 Stars. Anyway, it’s a great app 🔥",good
"I downloaded this app and I didn't expect much but its honestly amazing! I love the simple layout and everything about it. I love that you can add or delete tools like for me, I wanted to have a habit tracker and I could simply enable that. I can clearly see why it is editors choice! Recommend it to everyone! ❤ Edit: You can only do 5 habits with subscription sadly.",good
Terimakasih sudah membantu,good
Easy n accurate....user friendly app. Voice to text funtion is also very helpful.,good
"Good, but I can't figure out some things. Like I'd rather have undated things listed above my next yearly reminders that don't happen for another year.",good
"Good little to do app, but, how can you activate the sync feature ??",good
"This app is almost perfect and a league above the others. However there is one thing missing and it is the ability to have repetitive tasks. Suppose I want to grow the habit of brushing my teeth every night, I don't want to keep creating the same tak every day. So the ability to have daily tasks. This app is still the best and much better than its competitors.",good
"This is a very good app, but it doesn't quite meet my needs. I canceled my account, but they kept charging me for months. I finally got through to their customer service, and they refunded all my money. I have adjusted my review to reflect this. Otherwise, this app is well thought out and worth trying.",good
Some things should be made easier like typing in the tasks one after the other easily without having to press 'Save and New' everytime.,good
Helps me accomplish my tasks,good
✔️This App has all the features and customisation required in a Task Mgmt app. And the developer is proactive. ❌ What freaks me is doubts about data security as the company is based out of Hong Kong.,good
Pretty good. Some bugs.,good
Good,good
"It's a good app ,it has everything which a study app require or more...but only it doesn't have ranking system....",good
so simple and user friendly,good
Godd,good
Very good,good
So far so good,good
"I'm not sure if this is something you can fix but since my Samsung phone got the Android 10 update, the widgets are very small. So many great features! Very flexible with lists, auto lists and tags. Different ways to view and sort your tasks, a great calendar view that also allows you to just see your events in the background. Really like the pomo timer with white noise as well. Great to have also have habit tracking in the same app. Just switched from monthly to yearly premium subscription.",good
Good app to keep track of the to-do list,good
It is a fun appp.,good
A very cool program. We want Arabic.,good
Ok,good
Does this app have auto sync with Google account?,good
"Really well done, and fills the void Wunderlist left. Thank you for this app and thank you for making it free.",good
This works very well!! Awesome app.,good
I loved the app so much . It is amazing and helps me a lot organize my ideas.. I think if it had the option to put our tasks in order and the option of setting timer it would be very organized and irreplaceable.,good
Good but some more ease is needed,good
The widget is quite imlressive,good
Just what I needed! Would give 5 if it had time tracker.,good
"I've been using TickTick for probably 4 years, and it's the best to-do list app out there. It's simple and straightforward, and I love that I can have it on all of my devices and computer, and keep one to do list wherever I go. I would love to give it 5 stars, but over the last few months it's been very glitchy with syncing between my various devices.",good
I definitely recommend it.,good
"Great. Better than todoist cause you can organize how you want in inbox or ""all"" view, despite priority or reminder time. That option is what sets it above. Wish that android reminders were full screen, however or that snooze reminders could be optionabke for time. View in website and windows app also could be draggable for left to right sizing of columns",good
"Great app but I would like to see ToDo's within ToDo's. I mean like, When u click a ToDo, it should open more sub-ToDo's. Then I surely give you 5 stars",good
good,good
Nice app,good
It's user friendly... love using it..,good
Like this app. It had everything I expected a ToDo list to do so I have no complaints.,good
It gives notification on time which mostly apps don't give.,good
Good,good
nice,good
Love this app. Would like to say thanks for creating this app. Three star only because calendar is bit buggy. One is there are no real time syncing with google calendar which force me to use Ticktick's calendar which is not convenient for me.,good
"Better than others but I have problem in the beginning, I'll let you know later...",good
"I loved this app so much. Though the notifications doesn't work if you're not online, but overall, it's the best To-do list app i've used.",good
"Hey! Even after Optimizing for battery optimization, I still get reminders only after I start the app. Please help ?",good
"So far, felt good.",good
"I like the design and the flow, I just don't like how some features require premium, but j guess that's how they make their money so i understand.",good
Good fun ... Motivated,good
Great app and experience all the features are great.,good
It's really good app... I have been using it for few days... Really helpful... Just one thing... When I add a new task it shows up on the top of existing tasks... Can I change the settings so that it will appear at the bottom? That's why given 4 stars...,good
Good,good
"This app is amazing! Very convenient to be honest. Everything is just there for u to setup, the interface looks simple but great, especially the dark theme. I love it. One main thing about this app is that the premium section of it does not overwhelm the user. It's there but it doesn't shovel itself to the users face. Compared to the others I've used this is a better deal.",good
I really like it. The reason I'm giving a 4 star is that I wish the focus promo could be set for more than 120 mins. 120 mins means I've got to keep changing it againg and againg for longer focus periods which breaks the focus. P.s. I'm using the free version. I don't know whether it available on the premium version or not.,good
"Great app, most of the features with reasonable limitations are available in the free plan already. Pomo sometimes doesn't work though, the timer just gets stuck at 25:00 after it starts",good
It is a nice app and really helps me manage my tasks especially study tasks....it should also include features like sharing schedule with friends .,good
This app is great. Really nice for organizing stuff. Only thing I miss is a monthly overview with statistics.,good
Really nice but need some more changes,good
I love this app. Only thing that annoys me is how marking a task as complete in one device doesn't dismiss notifications on the others. :(,good
Good but is there a one time fee for this thing? I abhor having to pay $2.99/month vs just paying a one time fee..,good
Very good app for time management,good
Excellent app.,good
"Looks really good, but unfortunately couldn't get to set a customized template...",good
Tick Tick is good but it should add more ring tones please try,good
Good,good
"I actually tried a lot of apps, and after 1 year with Asana, I switched TickTick. Only 4 stars because the app neither fully supports syncing to Google Calendar, nor does it display the calendar events with the colors which were set in the calendar.",good
this was a great tick of thing to get i am more organized now insted of just have paper to do lists i got a digital one this great and think every one shound have it tho at times it can get hard to know how to do stuff but later on you get a hang of it.i love it,good
It is good but could be so much better with full Google Assistant integration...,good
"Absolutely amazing. A simple design that allows you to organize your task into a list that you can format however you want, and see on your phone, computer, or Android Wear. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the syncing between devices is a little bit inconvenient. Often, I would make changes to my tasklist on my phone, and they would not show up on computer until I went back into the app and manually refreshed it.",good
"I like the fact that you can put some tasks for everyday , and you can classify the tasks by list but I would rather if it can give me my productivity rate after every week / month based on the number of tasks completed",good
Pretty good. Does what I need it to do.,good
Current Review: Please Add Feature Insert picture with Task Last Review: Awesome,good
"Had some weird hiccups and things to first figure it out, but got it going smoothly. Love the option to share todo lists, and the integration with other calendars. Stand alone web version also good, widget isn't great, but all around a very solid app. No intrusive ads, and a robust free version that is still worth using it you don't want to pay the monthly fee. Highly recommend trying it out.",good
"Best task manager app I've tried. They all have their quirks and shortcomings, but TickTick is overall the most complete of them.",good
Optional,good
Love how it's user friendly on all my devices,good
يا خويا يا خويا,good
Absolutely incredible app. Definitely getting premium. It has every feature you could imagine.,good
One of the best productivity apps ever in my opinion. And I've seen a lot of them.,good
best todo app + habit + perfect project mangement tool. all in one,good
Pomo is good,good
Very good,good
best app reminder ever i've tried,good
Incredible task management app. Absolutely love it. They have all the features I could possibly want. So impressed by its functionality and versitility. I use on both my Windows computer as well as my android phone. I put literally everything I need to do on it so it helps me out greatly. So appreciative of TickTick. Thank you! Hope it's here to stay. I'm enjoying the updates too. Highly recommend.,good
When you think you are satisfied they surprise you with more .,good
Useful. Very convenient,good
Amazing it gets the job done literally,good
"2018 Better than Any.do in managing tasks since they integrated Pomodoro. You dont spend alot of time in it to manage your tasks and thats a good thing. You spend your time actually doing your tasks. Todoist are just too complicated, and Wunderlist are too simple. 2020 Update. Still the best out there. Even with the new Microsoft Todo, this one does adapt to your own workflow. This is also perfect for 1 to 2 person team, or consultants.",good
🥰,good
Good app for monitor day to day activities.,good
Amazing!,good
"This is really well built, simple, useful and good looking :)",good
I've been looking for an app like this for ages! Finnaly found! The best todo app in the world. For me much much better than todoist where you have to pay even for reminders (sic!). Here you have almost everything for free. You have to try it!,good
"It's got all the features and comforts you could wish for (even in the free version!), looks good, works well, got no ads; it's a no-brainer! Coming from a guy who's tried *all* of the alternatives, this is by far the best, and not by exclusion.",good
It helped me a lot,good
"This app has changed the entire course of my life. From health to relationships and productivity. This app is a life saver. One suggestion: regarding habits it would be good if it has all the quotes relating to that habit and so those quotes (maybe along with pictures?) pop up every day on reminder and motivate you. As am example If I want to go to gym, in reminder I am shown random quote written on some inspirational picture.",good
Perfect Tasking Partner,good
"This for me is the best planner app I have come across. I have tried and used many apps. But each one lacked some or the other feature. But Ticktick has all the features I need and the app is so easy to use. This app is helping me plan better, stay organized and get things done. Keep up the great work.",good
"Its just wooooow this is an amazing app it has almost all features that u need without upgrading to premium there literally no adds wich I loooove , a plus I really want the calendar I wish if they could made it free ㅠㅅㅠ anyway this app is loove . Waaaaaaay better than todoist",good
The best,good
Previous issue has been resolved. Once again my favorite and most used app. Thanks for recent update.,good
jus loved the app.,good
Good for both Track Habits and To Do List..,good
Does everything I want from it. Clean and intuitive design.,good
"Ребят, все ниче, но у вас английский язык иногда становится русским , видимо из-за системных настроек ...",good
Works very well.. easy to use,good
"This is by far the best to do list app I've found, I've installed literally 17 different to do list apps and this is definitely my favorite",good
Best to do list app by a mile.,good
Simple and best,good
Very handy app. 2 notifications on task in free version!,good
"If you want to achieve your goals, this app will organize your plans very well.",good
"Must have app for everyone who focus's on productivity improvement. This app helps me a lot to manage my goals, everyday task, and also long term goals. The app is really easy to use.",good
"Persistent, consistent and easy to use! I can entrust half my fights against my bad habits to this app.",good
One of the best Work mangement app!!,good
"Incredible, having veen looking for an app like this for do long!",good
Good,good
After messing around with todoist and wunderlist I found their free versions lacking. Tick-Tick has enough unlocked to make a long term trial viable. If I am still using it in 3 months time I will upgrade. EDIT;6 weeks on and using paid for version and very useful with chrome app on Computers syncing perfectly. Update - still my main reminders tool.,good
Awesome experience overall. Using for years.,good
"Good apps, help me so much to do my task",good
مفید,good
Wonderful app I recommend it,good
Ok,good
رائع بالنسبة ليا .. في الأول كنت ساعات اسجل وساعات أنسى .. لحد ما اتعودت .. جميل جدا,good
User interface is very good,good
Works good,good
"Please return all those old white noises. I loved them. While I am happy for the new ones, it's better if the old ones were retained",good
Very nice,good
Very customizable and full of branching!!,good
"Premium version is the best calendar app I could find. I tried to avoid paying and spent a long time reading reviews, but for all apps something crucial was missing from free version. In this case, calendar integration with Google didn't sync properly, so I switched to the premium version so I can use ticktick as my only calendar.If you're trying to use free version, this is pretty annoying. It's cheap, though (slightly cheaper than the main competitor todoist), so I'm fine with paying.",good
Very good,good
This is excellent. Does exactly what you need it to do. Recommended if you just want a simple task & reminder app.,good
Good app,good
Good,good
Good App,good
"Superb, Very Easy to Schedule & use..",good
This app is really great,good
"With the recent addition of recursive sub tasks, ticktick really offers the best-in-class PM / task management tool for solos. Key features: cross-platform including windows, very useful smart lists, beautiful Android widgets, true drag n drop and a very clean UI on all platforms. Very stable - no crashes in the last 3 years. Very fast on all platforms. Ticktick's features are as usable as many high-end workgroup solutions. Only downside is tech support can be slow to respond.",good
Best to do habit tool.o have used,good
I like how the dou,good
👌👌👌😎,good
"There's a couple of small features that I'm missing and I have a few nitpicks, but overall this is certainly the best app of its kind; miles ahead of Todoist.",good
It's simple and fast...,good
"Awesome app. Better than THINGS, Todoledo and others. Loving it.",good
Excellent app ... loving it ... best replacement of wunderlist. (My mistake about Family Library. In App purchases can't be shared in Google Family Library as a standard. Nothing to do with ticktick team. Reverted to 5 star),good
"A couple months in, the best for me. It has developed a good feature set on a modern platform. Still finding helpful features.",good
help me to increase my productivity,good
"Multi-tag search is very much needed! e.g. ""#next #next"" in search bar",good
This is app is great,good
Great app... All in ione app... Should try!!!,good
Good 🙂👍,good
Need to little colourfull,good
Best tasks app. Period,good
Excited about making a future,good
It's awesome👍,good
Outstanding app really loved it 💙✨,good
Simply the best productivity app,good
Best app for ha bit creation I loved it Super,good
"There are a lot more options than GTasks, and it is synchronizing between my devices without a problem.",good
Amazing got to know about it from mkbhd,good
I am quite comfortable with it. Quite convenient. Meeting my expectations well.,good
I've been using for like 2 years... No complaints,good
Half baked nested tasking feature has hugely impacted the usability of the app. Reminders and repeats are completely messed up. Don't know what is the purpose.,good
Okay.,good
"It's incredible not only because I can plan my work, but also because of the pomodoro feature. Habits too.",good
Great tool to boost productivity!!,good
Very intuitive and user friendly,good
Great for persistent reminders! If you liked Due on the iPhone and were looking for a replacement this is it.,good
Best app for being productive. 10/10,good
Very helpful application in analysis of your effort scores 👍🔥 highly recommended 👍🔥,good
Does great for a to do list planner..,good
"Simple, easy to use. My fav to-do listplanner so far!",good
Good app. Highly advise you to test it.,good
How awesome this app is. Makes it a breeze to track what needs to be done. Also love the new kanban view!,good
"Great, simple to use and best of all, free !",good
This really helped me organizer my day,good
"This app is Very Awesome, always keeps me on track 100%✓",good
Best planner I have ever tried do far,good
Trust me guys..I have been searching for such an app in the whole playstore!this is the best of all😍No purchasing required!Without purchasing we can choose upto 5 habits that's enough and more...this is really cool😍😍,good
THE BEST ONE OF THESE TYPE OF APPS! Has all you may need!,good
Amazing,good
Seems good so far,good
Some daily tasks just disappear a minute after I tick them. This bug is affecting me for about a week now and I'm already tired of it.,good
"Tremendous Todo App, where you get every option which you want. Thanks Ticttick App developer who give us such a best todo app",good
Really useful app. It helps you to organise your day properly and reminds you important things on time.,good
That's the app which I was looking for,good
This is worth your time and totally recommended app,good
"Using it since like a month, and its the best one by far, I don't really find any of the sections any useful other than the tasks and calendar. At lest for me. But its a great way to schedule my day and stay productive.",good
It's best app for control your time It's perfect app👌👌👑👑👌👌,good
Ut's an amazing app to control your plans,good
The best habit app I've ever used and I've tried a bunch! The UI is beautiful and the app is very responsive.,good
A good one to go with especially with your study time table.,good
"Great app, it does all I need it to do and more....",good
Love it so far!! Favorite task manager that I've tried and I've tried a lot.,good
This should be default calendar app by now. Give us that option.,good
"I love it! User-friendly, simple and has got everything I need.",good
It's great for catching up with assignments! ^^,good
Needed this a lot... Using this a lot... Has become a part of my daily life... Edit: Thank you so much once again for this great app.,good
"I don't usually do reviews, but I wrote this one , because this app has helped me very much, easy to use and very time efficient. Love it.",good
"Since joining their very affordable monthly subscription, I've found TickTick to be an indispensable part in my daily routine, and it's actually helping me be more productive even though I'm a pretty begrudging procrastinator. First off, the widgets. God, I love the widgets! The first thing I see after unlocking my phone is A) a list of all the stuff I need to be doing on that given day; and B) a cute visual checklist of daily habits that I need to also make time for. This was what I found was missing back when I used the ToDoIst app, was a simple means of having both habits and to-dos living in the same shared ecosystem. I suppose there are technically more dedicated habit apps with deeper tracking features, but what's here is perfectly functional, and easily integrates into your regular 'inbox'/'today' lists. The widgets update dynamically, right along with the full-screen app, and also with the PC and web integrations. This was a ""must-have"" feature, because I've tried other productivity apps where there is lag time between inputs on the widget, and seeing them ""refreshed"" into existence several minutes later in the app itself. TickTick makes everything instant, to the point that a TickTick notification 'pings' on my phone at the precise moment it also 'pings' on my laptop. I really can't understate how useful the widget and cross-platform integration is, because for someone like me who procrastinates a lot and forgets what I'm meant to be doing at any random moment, it's so useful to just open up my phone and instantly have my most important tasks/habits slap me in the face, demanding my attention. This also ties in nicely with the way notifications/alerts work. I've got reminders set on all my habits, and when the reminders go off, they actually ""take over"" the entire screen, at which point I can tick them off, or dig into the more extensive options on the back-end. There's a few areas I can see for quality-of-life improvements, though I'm optimistic that their subscription model means we haven't seen the ""final"" iteration of this app for some time yet. A few things that jump out at me over a couple months' usage: -- To mark a habit as ""incomplete"", you can't just double-tap the checkbox for an 'X' mark, you have to open the app, pull up the relevant habit in the dashboard, go into its settings, and the option is buried all the way in the app's back-end menus. It's a minor gripe, but when compounded over weeks or months of use, it's easy to just not bother marking your ""failures"" at all. It makes me wonder if there's other useful features I've missed just because they're not readily accessible on the front end UI + widgets. -- It would be nice if habits displayed in the widget + front-end UI had a visual indicator of how many days that habit has been on ""streak"" for. You can track those metrics, but again it's hidden in the robust-yet-opaque back-end, accessible via sub-menus and abstract graphs, rather than being loudly displayed front-and-centre. I'd probably be more motivated to ""keep the streak going"" with a given habit if I could see at a split-second glance how today's efforts fit into the context of the previous 7 days, or whatever. --Also, you can set habits to only repeat on certain days of the week, or a certain number of times per week, but again its not really visible at a quick glance to know if you're on track or falling behind. By which I mean, when I pull up my habits for Thursdayy, for instance, and I see ""exercise at gym"" in my list of habits for that day, then surely I should get some indication of ""you've been to the gym X times this week so far, and you have Y gym sessions remaining for this week [in order to fulfil your habitual obligations]"". Again, the information is there in the app, but you have to actively seek it out. Maybe the more fastidious time-keepers will see to this without batting an eye, but for forgetful, ADHD-prone types like myself, if it's not right in front of me then it might as well not exist. But all in all, these are minor foibles. Fantastic app. 5/5.",good
Really a full package app for all types of need I loved it so much.,good
"I have been using this for quite sometime now. No nonsense app, gets the job done. But after Oreo update, I can't seem to find custom notification sound for Ticktick. Earlier i had set a custom sound for reminder which was very useful. This is the only issue for me.",good
It's a very good task manager app than compared to Todoist with the free plan.🙂🙂🙂,good
"Its actually good, it helps me with my everyday routine and most functional of all apps for to do list",good
Perfect specially on laptop,good
Very user-friendly. The free version is good enough. I like it!,good
The best to do app I've used so far,good
"This has to be the best GTD app out there now. The free version is extensive and includes features that others charge like the most useful Kanban feature! With Google Calendar integration, I finally have all meetings, tasks and reminders in one place! The UI is so easy and intuitive that on the day I installed it, I was able to plan a web-development project and assign tasks in just minutes. It also has notes and white noise. Task level status would make it even better at managing projects!",good
Best app for sure for estate agents,good
Best. To do list. Ever,good
Wonder Full,good
"Really good app, both when it comes to managing tasks and tracking habits. It supports language input when creating tasks such as ""every Monday"". It also has a few useful widgets for the home screen. Only bad thing about this app is that you have to pay if you want to get access to all features, but it's not that expensive and the app is really good even without premium so that's why it still gets five stars from me.",good
"The description didn't tell me that filters were premium when it listed premium features. Edit: Maybe saying something like ""TickTick premium features include the following and more"" would be more clear - thanks for the reply!",good
Very Effective Application,good
Good,good
Its good to organize schedule,good
Please add Money management also.,good
Great to keep you on track,good
"Honestly love this app, I swear its made me become a more organized person and I always recommend it to people. Sadly, I haven't been sponsored yet T-T lol jk. BUT FR THO. I don't usually give a review so that's how you know this app is unique! I don't have premium cause I'm broke like that 🙈 but even without premium, it's pretty good. I recommend!",good
Have used daily for 2 years now I like how it's customizable and I can see events for several years ahead at a glance. That native alarm is loud enough but not blaring and it's great for repetitive events or tasks.😻 There are NO ADS!!,good
Deserves the 5 star and support is incredible!,good
"Honestly, just an incredible app. You've never seen more features or ways to organize your life in a single place. I use it in conjunction with the Desktop app, and it's quickly become my go-to. No ads, tons of features, and no bugs as far as I can see. Download it!!!",good
Perfect💜,good
Wonderful app to keep you up to date and to remind you to complete your tasks in time.,good
Good features and Sample interface,good
I love this app. It helps a lot.,good
Good,good
I can't speak more highly of this app. It just keeps getting better. I came over from Todoist several months ago and have not regretted it for a single day. Keep up the great work!,good
Great Work 💪🏻,good
Very clean and straight forward to use.,good
"Loving the app so far. I have gone through so many to do lists from minimal to most customizable. This is by far unmatched. Is there a way to make a due date as a week number? So for instance if I want to work on a project during a certain week, but I'm not sure which day just yet how can I add that?",good
I love This App. Actually Calender widget is very handy I been Using it From Past 5 months.Give it A try you'll Love it Definitely !!,good
Love the free version! Considering the paid version - seems pricey for an annual fee.,good
Awesome app The best to do app that I have used and I have. Used a lot it's better than todoist for its coustimization even in the free version. It's just great!,good
"Great app for keeping track of things you have to get done. I love the feature that lets you add lists inside of folders, I use mine for different subjects in school. It also has a nice calendar view of your tasks and is great for setting reminders.",good
"Very useful, must have app.",good
It's very fruitful to get done my work as productive.,good
Perfect app in all kind,good
The best I've ever seen out of dozens of apps. Regularly makes small improvements. Always room for improvement but thoroughly impressed.,good
Good,good
Very good. And has all the options that you need. It seems they have thought of everything. I would recommend this app.,good
Awesome,good
Best in class,good
"So far, I think it's good enough, but a little advice from me, it would be better if the ""note"" mode added a folder feature, that is, we can ""add notes to a note"". Hopefully it can be responded to and thank you for reading.",good
"The best Todo list app!!! I like it so much, there are a lot of features which can help you to boost your productivity",good

"My go-to todolist app: frequently updated with excellent features: tags, attachments, comments, recurring and location-aware tasks, natural language input, reminders, habit tracking, pomodoros, calendar integration, flexible lists, kanban boards, markdown support, gamification elements with badges and scores, and more recently: subtasks for project management, note system, etc. One of my all-time favourite apps, it's become an essential part of my day-to-day workflow, I'm an absolute fan 😍",good
"Clean look, simple to use",good
Good app,good
So much better than Google or Microsoft similar apps. A practical app that provides every thing you need even in free mode.,good
The only app that effectively helps me get things done.,good
Awesome and easy to use app,good
like it!,good
Awesome.,good
Very usefull app,good
Nice amazing app .,good
Very useful for task management.,good
Awesome! Syncs could be faster though. Habits take too much time to sync and some completed tasks on the laptop sync very late sending a barrage of unnecessary notifications on the phone or vise versa. Amazing response time of support and dev teams,good
Very nice app...👌👌👌,good
Very nice and easy.,good
Thank you next,good
Easy to use. Has really helped me organise and reach my goals. I wish there was more customisation options for maybe one off payments rather than monthly for premium but even the non-premium version is great.,good
Best todo app,good
The best productivity app of all time!!!!!,good
TickTick is making me more productive. A writen task is done task for me,good
I am very setisfied with your work. Just add one new feature that has a switch on off tap to pause the remainder of any task any time. For example if i make a task of yoga daily. Then i can turn off the task for some time and then turn it on later.,good
Works perfectly and suits my needs.,good
Voice alret only missing,good
"Great widget, great customizability, great notifications. Simple reminders, recurring tasks, and things you want to do today are all easy to schedule.",good
"Use this professionally as a daily task manager as I have a terrible memory, really helps structure my day",good
"Are you kidding? All the cool character customization items (which are very limited in the first place) cost real money. I thought the purpose of the app was to help people by motivating them with rewards, but there's absolutely nothing interesting you can buy for your character with the regular currency. What is the point then? Ridicilous. Put ads in it if anything, but not lock the very few items you have available behind a currency that costs real money.",poor
"RACIST APP!!! Why the FFF don't you have my skin color?? So, I can be light blue and green but no caucasian? Oh right, nowadays we're supposed to be the villains of the world, isn't it!?",poor
This app doesn't have a background music which makes it not like a game at all. No music doesn't make me interested at all. Put like a doom soundtrack or at least something :(,poor
Recent update has so many bugs. Tasks and habits will be gone upon first opening the app. I have to restart the app every time I want to do something. Save and delete buttons are the same color as the banner or gone entirely. I love this game but I'm about to be done after this update. 🙁,poor
👎,poor
How do I save changes to dailies(I have a ton of subtasks I curate as I hone in my routines) The save confirm button is gone! Also the app feels so different than the last version and it's a shock but that's par for the course with updates.,poor
"It won't let me set a username. Just says ""username already taken"" even if I type in a random string of letters/numbers",poor
"There's no button or method for saving changes or deleting tasks, meaning I can't use this app at all",poor
Didn't feel like a game,poor
"Well, this was great until this update. Now it's impossible to see anyting because it's so small. Please change it back.",poor
Can't open app after the new update.,poor
"The reviews have great things to say, but I'm stuck at the display name and username screen. I triple checked them and they fit the requirements, but it won't let me move on. Until I can log in, this app is basically useless",poor
this is maybe what radicalizes people into anchro-primitivists,poor
Couldnt sign up . No passwords accepted,poor
Tutorial suddenly stopped and I couldn't complete it.,poor
Absolute mess of an app,poor
Too damned complicated to even keep up with. A video game hub is more organized and simplified than this.,poor
"Nothing has changed, this dumb app still won't sync up with my account I use on my desk top. Come on, developers! And it still forces me to open a new account. This is why I won't subscribe, the help here is useless.",poor
Crashes,poor
I cant Register on this app. It always says 'server connection lost '.,poor
"What is going on? The app says ""server connection lost""",poor
"Opaque, complicated, janky. Overall, a frustrating and confusing ap.",poor
It's been months and I still cannot delete this one habit. It will not delete and nothing I've been sent has been helpful to figure out why. About ready to find a different app cause it's driving me nuts.,poor
can somebody tell me why the heck wud this app wanna hv accesss to my gmail account???,poor
I have just downloaded this app and I can't register. Is there a reason for that?,poor
"Loads of bugs, can't even register. Probably due to server side reliance and poor state management in the app. Will definitely avoid.",poor
I can't download it to my phone,poor
Y doesn't the reminder work!!! I m trying m trying changed all my settings according to this and it doesn't work at all it doesn't remind me i tried and set a particular time and i was waiting but it didn't i m fed up really this made me more anger than ever🤧🥵😶😶😶😶😑😑😑,poor
"Broken app on Android. Tried to create a new account and objects were missing from the app. For instance, the initial tutorial only had pictures and no words. Also when making my avatar, there were no images or options that showed up. Worked fine on my wife's iPhone but not my note 9.",poor
the app's interfere is really irritating it's already sets meaningless things for you in infine order,poor
"Have to register and the app doesn't even work. Nothing happens when you press ""let's start"".",poor
Can no longer add tasks to challenges. Data won't save. Rubbish app.,poor
"Stuck on setting the user name, no error message etc. Used to be good",poor
Unable to download it beyond 78% even as other apps download in a second,poor
Waste of time. Unhelpful and unmotivating.,poor
Kept bugging out trying to register/log in,poor
Too many errors,poor
"I love it except, and this is a big issue for me, it's totally server based. Want to update anything, but have a bad internet connection? Too bad, it's either going to take forever or fail. I would use and maybe even pay for this app to just have a way to have everything first be saved on my device. So, back to hunting for a to-do app. Edit 3/23: I have to drop my review on this to 1 star. You can manually edit values within the app for stats making any it unreasonable that I need internet.",poor
"It does not seem possible to have a simple shopping list shared with another person... Nice app, but useless.",poor
"I should be able to use the app when offline, and the app should sync the changes whenever connected to the internet. It shouldn't force me to connect with the internet for ticking a checkbox!",poor
Buggy as all hell. The advertisement is right. It gamifies tasks... But that's it. No tracking history of your habits. Inaccurate as all hell. Worst of all is you can't delete your account. They'll forever keep your data. I'm sure that's illegal in parts of this country and around the world. Definitely don't use your real email to sign up to test it out.,poor
Stopped,poor
"Can't even start it properly. Just says ""Path 'profile.name' is required.""",poor
Unfortunately i can not sign up or sign in. By google account or email. I tried a lot. From iran,poor
"Great concept, but I can't even create an avatar. This is a constant bug listed in reviews. The company says that your selections should show up after you start actually using the app, but how can they when we can't even actually CHOOSE anything. I guess I'll try one of the competitors apps.",poor
"This app is completely unusable on my Note10+ The account creation is riddled with errors and when I finally get into the app, I can't click on any items or add a new item without the app instantly crashing. I was excited by the premise and motivated to start using it, but the experience was downright embarrassing. I'd love for a developer response here to acknowledge these problems and maybe offer some solutions.",poor
Mandatory registration,poor
"impossible to register, circle, circle, circle... and nothing",poor
"Broken from the start, can't do anything",poor
"Doesn't seem to work on OP 6T, can go through character creation, but doesnt let me customize or select anything. half of the UI shows up blank.",poor
Cant see my character,poor
App has no images on S10+ and is completely unusuable,poor
"Would love to actually get started with this app, but for whatever reason I can't even build my avatar. None of the options for selecting what I want my avatar to look like actually show up on the screen, they're all completely invisible.",poor
I was looking forward to using this app. But it wont even let me pick out an avatar. Things just go blank on the app and tells me I'm missing information when I clearly am not. What a bummer,poor
App has many bugs. 1. Start screen doesn't display first 3 slides. User creating is totally not functional. I'm using both Android 9 and Android 10 same bugs.,poor
"The two starting pages were blank, same as character customization. I saw another comment and there's any new version to update. I was excited to try this app but I couldn't :(",poor
"The first 2 slides are black and I can't see character in the character creation. Some message saying ""path 'profile' required habitica...i hope this gets fix soon. Until then I I'll wait.",poor
"Blank screens when initially launching, character creation screen missing most assets but still semi functional. Unable to begin. Oneplus 6T A10",poor
Wont let me change my appearance so I'm stuck as a black female. The user interface is very poorly designed,poor
Completely unusable on Android right now. Everything is blank or not loading. Downloaded and deleted right away which is unfortunate because it looked like something I'd be really interested in.,poor
The app is broken right now. Downloaded today to try it out and the first two slides were blank. Character creation is all blank. Unfortunately deleted but was looking forward to trying. This has been catalogued by others. When its fixed I'll try again but so far it seems that this app is only really properly supported for iPhone users. (I have a Samsung S9),poor
"After adding task to the app, it just doesn't shows up.",poor
"Super buggy on Android, have to close and open constantly for anything to work.",poor
"My phone is a Samsung S8+. The introduction screen is mostly blank, and the character customization seems to be broken because your character and customization options don't show up. I didnt go any further.",poor
"App broken, don't bother. Like many many other reviewers, this app is totally broken and defunct on Android devices and specifically Galaxy S10 / Note 10 devices. It seems the developer response to all of those reviews is ""please report a bug"" but this has now been an issue for months that they haven't looked into fixing despite dozens of notifications from users that their app is broken. I have instead now downloaded an app by another developer which actually works. I will not be back.",poor
Installed it and it glitched and didn't display many of the images on the 'create your avatar' page. Immediately Uninstalled.,poor
Quite disappointed with this app. Is used to be fine for past years. Currently is really slow when checking my task and is so frustrating at times. This app need improvement on the server and at times server down :(.,poor
Doesnt work the main screen is stuck i can move to the next page.,poor
"Downloaded this app hoping for a fun way to form new habits, but when I get to the register screen the first two tutorial panels are blank and then the third one lets you link social media accounts. Then I can't save the username and display name I create, and the avatar generator screen doesn't load any options. Opened the app the next day to find nothing I could edit had been saved. Uninstalled and tried registering again with a different account and got the same results. Pretty disappointed",poor
Same issue as Don Smith who wrote a review on 10/10/19. Will consider this app but the lack of slide visuals and character visuals makes the app in-op. Current phone is the Google pixel 4xl......perhaps I misspoke in regards to the reply. My issue is not with the visuals but the lack of visuals. Everything is blank for me so literally can not see half of the content.,poor
"Doesn't show character customisation, think it needs an update",poor
Path profile name is required glitch when trying to make avatar on Galaxy s10,poor
"So many portions of the app we're not appearing on the screen from the get go, including the first two screens entirely, and even the avartar selections.",poor
"Busted from the start. On the first open of the app I got a 3 pane swipe intro and the first 2 were blank purple screens. Then, on the Avatar creation screen the Avatar wasn't visible. When finally getting in to the app the ""help text"" bubble didn't point at anything, just the bottom of the screen for the whole dialogue. This app sounded interesting but it seems there's a complete lack of interest in quality.",poor
App didn't work at all. Was buggy from the start of my sign up where I used my Google account to login.,poor
Want to like it. So far half of the set up items aren't even showing up for my samsung s8. All the purple screens are blank. Was excited to try but it doesn't work.,poor
The website works but the app is blank.,poor
This app has some major problems. It seemed to work fine for the first day of running. After the first day no reminders were executed. Any game armor or weapons could never be equipped. it appeared you could equip them but once you left the screen they become unequipped and they never showed up on the avatar. I mainly got this app for productivity and since the reminders do not work I'm not certain I'm going to continue using it unless these problems are fixed.,poor
It's broken. I try to create my account and I can't even use the name I want or customize my character. It's just broken. Nothing displays.,poor
I have been trying to download the app but its just not happening. Please look into it.,poor
"App is completely broken. Can't even make an avatar -- none of the options show up. Also, get an error message when trying to show a display name",poor
Please make this app offline as well,poor
"Wanted to try this, but it doesn't seem to properly load images to create my character or load tutorial pages so I can't even continue from the create screen. Seems like it's broken...",poor
Will not open disappointed as i was looking forward to using this service,poor
"Can't log in. The password input is shorter on the in-app login than both the reset password field as well as the login form on web, so my correct password is rejected",poor
It keeps lagging and dificult to select the traits i want for my character... ugh ! Not worth it UNINSTALL !,poor
Can't set the username field,poor
App is no longer functional. Cant even Start app without it malfunctioning. Cant change username or character. It was fine before the update!,poor
Downloaded the app and the server just did not want to connect and synch my to do list and habits. Gave up after 10 mins.,poor
You need internet access and the server has to be up on their side for you to be able to access your to-do list. Server has been down today and I cant check off or edit my to-do list due to that. Going to be deleting this app. Most other to-do lists work offline.,poor
"I had really begun to depend on this app and was having fun. Then I downloaded the update. I now have NOTHING. Not even the IMAGE of an avatar, there's just NOTHING THERE. I have no experience, no level, no coins, NOTHING. I was having a really awful day and this was just icing on the cake. There was so much I put into this game. How can I remember all of the tasks I scheduled for myself? I am so so discouraged.",poor
"I couldn't register , the circle rounds and rounds .. And nothing happens",poor
"Can't even log in. Seems to stop working or freeze up every time. Just downloaded the app for the first time, can't make a new account or log in. Waste of time, will be looking for other apps that actually let me get past the log in screen.",poor
"It's completely broken, things don't show up, error codes from the very beginning, it's just broken",poor
"As soon as I downloaded the app and made a new account, I couldn't create a new character because under the body, skin, and other options to make your character was blank. When I changed my display name, I got a weird message for 'profile.name' required. The randomize button didn't even work for me either. I left originally because there were many bugs with to-do's and other things and I'm not confident it's functional past the character creator, so I don't see a point to continue. On the S10E",poor
"I kept getting empty screens when opening the app, so I pressed skip. Filled out the registry info and was taken to character creation where I couldn't see my character or the build options. I could select things like body or hair, but nothing appeared relating to that.",poor
"I really want to use this app, but on my Galaxy S10, the first 2 of the 3 slides in the introduction before logging in, are blank. The character visuals on the character customization are invisible, and on the settings menu, I scroll down and the options start to overlap each other (hard to describe). I will consider reinstalling after the graphical issues are fixed because it seems like a great app, but currently it's unusable for me.",poor
Major issues need all email so I can send you pics pixel 2xl,poor
Apps been broken from the moment I download need fixing,poor
Nothing loads up. Probably a bad glitch,poor
"--Update 2--: Okay, I think I have figured it out. The app doesn't sync with the servers on my WiFi, but works fine on my Data connection. Weirdly enough, the web version works on my laptop using the same WiFi. Please fix. --Update 1--: Reinstalled app. Apparently login with Google is completely broken. Not working at all. That's why maybe the data is not syncing? --Original--:No data loads upon startup; just a blank screen with 0 health, 0 xp, and 0 mana.",poor
"beginning setup wasn't loading at all. signed up using Facebook. since it was not loading, i just clicked next. now I'm stuck with my Avatar with no way to change",poor
"There seems to be no way to actually mark a task as complete, so I had to delete the tasks I actually did complete and therefore have not gotten in-game rewards. There is also no way at all to contact support. If you join the Habitat Help Guild that is supposed to allow you to ask questions, there is no obvious way to post a question there. There is a button to leave the guild but not one to post a question. This app is terrible and is a waste of time.",poor
"after signing in, I get random notifications telling me things I absolutely do not care about. I haven't even added any tasks and it's already telling me to join groups and blah blah blah... no thank you.",poor
Micro transaction. I wish I could give 0 stars.,poor
"Need to register, immediately deleted",poor
I am unable to download this app. It downloads uptil 82% and then stops. I have a android device,poor
Awful graphics. Idea ia great but the graphics need a major update. Can't tell the different between anything in this game. Overall disappointed.,poor
"Doesn't work in my country I have to use a VPN for it to work, which sucks of course. Syrian Arab Republic",poor
I AM SPECIFICALLY LOOKING FOR A GAMIFIED PRODUCTIVITY APP. MY REVIEW OF YOURS WHICH IS VERY LACKING: Dark theme is missing! This one appears to be for 5 year olds! Can you make a NON-CHILD app similar to this but for REGULAR PEOPLE not 5 year old RPG gamers? I avoided yours for a long time but still nothing exists yet for adults. I hate RPG (cause I'm not an anti-social loser) but want to gamify my productivity with public leaderboards in an app. Thanks. Looks well made but I don't want it.,poor
Good app but i can't do anything since To days ago ! Help me please your app je very usefull for me,poor
"Annoying, slow, clunky, unresponsive, repetitive",poor
"I was excited to try this app, but like many others have said, the customization screen doesn't work. Let me know when it's fixed and I'll update and hopefully be able to start using it.",poor
"It took 3 tries to get registered, now it wont let me change anything in character creation. I didnt even make it to setting up anything beyond skin tone before it wouldn't let me select anything. Awesome idea, crappy execution. Womp womp.",poor
"Failed at the first hurdle, couldnt customise my character to even get started. Next button worked thats about it. galaxy S8",poor
Wouldn't even let me customize.,poor
The customization screen at the beginning of set-up doesn't work. Tasks have tagging section with no clear way to actually add tags to it.,poor
Won't let me customize my avatar except for glasses.,poor
Uninstalled. Still cannot remove background to blank. Edit: Yep still the same. Also please put the free backgrounds at the top. This is from only within the app by the way.,poor
Ganky. Couldn't get it to work right.,poor
"First thing I did when I installed the app was disable notifications and yet I still get constantly spammed with notifications all day long. That aside, the app is poorly made. UI is very buggy. Chat functions are glitchy and don't update mezsages correctly. Sometimes the main ui responds to nothing. You can switch tabs and nothing changes till you close and open the app again. Almost all fun and worth while content is locked behind a paywall or subscription.",poor
"Doesn't work. Nothing happens when signing in with Google and when creating a new account, it just shows ""server timeout"".",poor
"Pretty disappointed that the first wall I hit is having to login or register. I get the whole cloud saving thing but at least give me the option and let the risk fall on me for data loss. The app looked promising and I was really impressed with the bit of pixel art I got to see. However, I'm not sure I want to sign up and allow access to my details or habits just yet.",poor
Terrible moderator community. Anti religious.  Reply: I've already had numerous interactions with Habatica mods and I've no desire to reply further. When I questioned why the website had an anti-Christian stance I was banned. Nothing more needs to be said.,poor
"i cannt acces my account anymore since their ""password reset"" feature does not work. tried on my iphone, android oreo, web version. i don't receive any email to reset my password.",poor
Great app but only if it was an offline app i would've given it a five star... please fix this...,poor
got banned for talking about not politically correct stuff in a respectful manner. didnt even had a chance to discuss or clear my name. would not recommend bc of it being heavily monitored and censored. it does not facilitate what it was aiming for a community for learning and growth. after pouring 2 months and money into it was terribly disappointed after my ban. yes perma ban. no warnings no nothing. disgusting. outsourcing will power is a bad idea anyways.,poor
"Seems broken - cant complete the process of creating new tasks, so I'm just stuck with a huge empty menu I cant change. Loved the idea but this is broken and unusable.",poor
confusing and definitely didn't motivate me to do tasks. just spent hours trying to figure out how to add personalized tasks.,poor
"Online? really? register? really? There's two other apps in the suggested/similar apps banner that are better than this & they're free to use with out registration (why?! for this type of app) , full & offline ( again)",poor
"I have been wanting to try out this app for a while. I registered, and everything is going great until i get to the character maker screen. i am unable to see my charcter and the customization options. Will send photos if needed. Will change rating once this is fixed.",poor
I got completely banned from this app today And I have screenshot from reddits about what happened to the chat in june 11 2019,poor
"Honestly, within a month of trying this, the app just got annoying and boring.",poor
"Definitely not for me, it was confusing. But hey if you are a gamer and suffering from mental health stuff. its for you",poor
I cant even registered.,poor
Can't login on the app but can on the site. So currently useless to me.,poor
far from what I expected after seeing the pictures...,poor
Uninstalled within a minute because it wouldn't let me set a username,poor
"downloaded this on a new device, no phone number on it, my account email isn't on it, i didn't back up any app data, and yet i was logged in when i opened it. super sketchy...",poor
This app runs on internet and is not very customizable. Life rpg is the best out there,poor
It's awesome but we don't know if it's GDPR compliant.,poor
"new update is full of bugs, pls do something",poor
uninstalled because it wouldn't work offline.,poor
because of not available in my country !,poor
so many bugs..enum not defined exceptions,poor
I couldnt even get past setting everything up before it glitched. I couldnt move on from types of goals. A pop up showed up that said something about strength and attributes.,poor
"widgets are broken on my OP6T stock , please fix.",poor
No i don't feel like getting weapons to hurt someone,poor
"App worked fine till they put in the new username update, now there's a bug where you can't get into the app because every name is taken",poor
the big problem is that task management should work offline and habitica should have synchronization feature like anki mobile and anki pc.,poor
I love it at first plus the very idea gamifying a task to make it a habit. It was all fun until the 'I cant use it offline' that really threw me off. Please make it available offline as well.,poor
"You have to register to ""play"". You can't even check it out to decide if it's worth it.",poor
couldn't login,poor
"Never really liked the features of Habitica. Instead, I do my stuff via LifeRPG.",poor
No bank and losing your life and all your gold is absolutely ridiculous after spending so much time using this app.,poor
"Stuck on ""username not available"" no matter what I put in...",poor
"Need to be online to use this app. In case you make changes in offline mode. It doesn't sync automatically when online. You need to again make those changes. Enable offline feature and offline data should be synced when ever we are online. Once this is done, you got my 5 star.",poor
can't change class.,poor
I cancelled my subscription back in June of last year and just realized my membership had been reinstated without my permission. I would like a refund for the months between now and then and (another) confirmation that my subscription is cancelled.,poor
"Literally WILL NOT WORK, every single time i click on this app it says ""Habitica has stopped working"" I cant even open the app!!! Please fix this, i really want to use this app",poor
Está dando problemas.,poor
Just installed. Keyed in all tasks n to-do list. Server error. Lost everything. Redo. Server error. Lost. Kept repeating. Frustrating = Uninstalled.,poor
I downloaded this app because I thought that the game concept for to-do lists would be really cool. Opened the app just after downloading and tried to register an account and it wouldn't let me log in. Waited another hour and it still wasn't working. Call me impatient but I just couldn't use an app that refused to work.,poor
Constant connection drop outs. Will update review when this is fixed.,poor
"nothing but connection error after connection error. the concept is great, but I can't even manage to use the service because any time I try to do anything, that's all I'm getting.",poor
Why do you need personal information?? Deleted.,poor
"Ever get a phone call from a Salesman whom you don't remember giving your phone number out to? this is the app that does it. it reads your phone number and identity and uploads it to the cloud where it can later be sold to the highest bidder. this app makes sure that it gets your identity because you have to login before you can even use it. once you log in, the game is a huge disappointment. mypoli has everything over this.",poor
"They banned me from the chat for saying SLAYER, as in the band!! WEAK!! POLITICAL CORRECTNESS HAS GONE WAAAY TO FAR!!",poor
"DL'd to try this app out, but could not get past the initial setup. Buttons missing labels or information, lethargic loading issues, and the graphics are really sub par for what other games host currently. Even the initial avatar appearance has most things locked behind a pay wall, and keeps putting me in a wheelchair! The idea behind the app has a lot of potential, and would be a joy to see if they can make it better and working properly. Will have to wait and see. As is? Not functional.",poor
Hate it,poor
its not like Loop Habits where i know i completed my habit this day. where are the statistics? give me the graphics,poor
More like: how to gain dopamine for being organized. Not helpful.,poor
"hey team, can you help me to fix error? my friend has invited me to his guild, i receive email about that, but i dont get the invitation in the app.",poor
This app is bullocks.I downloaded it and it ran smoothly on my phone and i setup my avatar my habits and my daily task and then it just stopped working and couldn't open the app again!,poor
Graphics are suck,poor
"Just starting and learning how to use. Unable to set correct due date on tasks. When I select that task has a due date, todays date appears. When I click that date the calendar displays. Allgood so far. But when I select a date on the calendar and close it, the due date is still today.",poor
"Administered by childish adults, I criticized one thing in the app politely, and they banned me immediately!",poor
"cant even use the app, it doesnt allow me to check off things.",poor
"I really wanted to love this app. It looks amazing & has so much potential. However, the app does not sync to your timezone. My day does not reset at midnight, despite what the app says. When I try to change the reset time to match up with the incorrect timezone, it keeps switching back to midnight. So my day randomly resets, usually around 6 or 7 pm. Sometimes, the day doesn't reset for more than 24 hours. & my avatar takes damage for the ""missed"" day. Makes it impossible to effectively use. :(",poor
Have to register,poor
"Uninstalling, took forever to load when my internet connection is just working fine on other apps.",poor
I CANNOT CHANGE the order of dailies which is frustrating since normally I would like to have them in chronological order.,poor
server issues please fix will change review when it's fixed,poor
It doesn't work. Worked fine first few hours now it keeps saying it can't connect to the server,poor
Requires being online to use. Which is a shame because it looks like a fun way to get motivated. Would use if it didn't require constant network or wifi connection (I live and work in rural areas) . Had to uninstall due to inability to use throughout the day.,poor
"It blocked me for no reason when I just only joined, i dislike this app.",poor
"This seems like a fun idea, and was recommended to me as especially helpful for people with ADHD, so I was intrigued. Unfortunately, I have encountered a bug where when I get to the screen where I choose my screen name and username, I cannot press the next button after filling out the name and username. Then, when I exit the app and go back to it, it's the default character and I cannot customise it/my account.",poor
"Please make it work again. The app is great, but it is not working and says I'm not connected to the internet, even though I have 2 available connections. Please, fix it!!!",poor
Uninstalled. Couldn't get it to register. Disappointed,poor
"Boot it up, a choice of login or register. Chose uninstall.",poor
Need to work offline,poor
Was expecting it to be offline,poor
Actually there is a difference between the username and the display name. But thanks for explaining that. Cannot change Display name.,poor
"Updated review: I have used this app for half a year, against my better judgement.  I have sent eighteen bug reports to the devs.  Little.  I could easily send another twenty more, but it isn't worth the time.  This is simply the most bugged piece of software I have ever used.  The avatars are hideous.  The only good thing that this app has going for it is the clean user interface, and a clever separation of the to-do list into three sections.  It is missing some pretty basic to-do list functionality.  The game loads slowly, and doesn't work without an internet connection.  Some of the bugs I've experienced: Reminders pop up on random days, no matter how many times I readjust their settings. Constantly having trouble connecting to the servers. Visual bugs: shows one item, but you get some other item.  Newly equipped main weapon won't show on avatar until app restarted. Progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page. Keyboards won't go away once they pop up. And the list goes on and on...",poor
It doesn't work!!,poor
Useless,poor
Does not work,poor
Update: problem fixed. Did you people just do another update? Because the app is completely screwed up. It can't recognize that my phone is connected to the internet.,poor
needs online account? you want to see our habits eh? no thank you.,poor
I keep getting a message saying the app can't connect to the server and every time I tap on a different colour of skin or shirt it stays the same.,poor
can't edit or change anything,poor
Is not working in my device. I can't open it :(,poor
"This is what everyone should have. It is the ultimate game. But it has a lot of bugs. I can't delete tasks, I can't edit tasks that were premade by the app. 2-3 basic features are missing. I'll change the rating to 5 stars once it is fixed. No, I'll not contact your team or email them the problem. It is basic and you should just fix the goddamn app.",poor
"I like the whole idea, but you have to develop the animation of characters to 3D",poor
I liked doing my tasks until they kicked me out for no reason😢. Why?,poor
"Dear Habitica, This app is currently impossible for me to use. There is no save OR delete button for editing habits. I checked your most recent reviews and a few others seem to have the same problem. Please, please, please fix this. I will say as well that the first opening of the game feels a little jarring. The editing of ones character feels clumsy and it is definitely not better to start with a randomized character. Give users a blank sheet and let THEM apply changes.",poor
"Ever since the latest update, it's too difficult to check off tasks. It keeps accidentally opening the task item for editing. So annoying!!",poor
Great app but I uninstalled it because I'm an offline user I wish if you can make it offline with all the functions.,poor
I'm trying to change the language but always stay in english...,poor
"Interesting concept, but the reward tiers are way too steep for beginners. You have to be using this app either constantly, or for a long time, in order to gain decent ""rewards."" Uninstalling, it's just taking up space on my phone at this point and I'm not really motivated to use it.",poor
Every 2 days it erases my goal list and my reward list for several hours then my lists reappear later.,poor
"I love dark mode, but it has become really difficult to see whether a daily sub task is checked off or not. This latest update has really thrown me off!",poor
Asking to register right away without trying out the app is poor experience.,poor
"It's good and all but I lost ALL my progress when I reset my phone. I logged into it with my email as I did before then it flashed ""HELLO NEW PLAYER"" cmon man, help me bring up my old account back",poor
It won't load my to-do's which is an important aspect. Fix it please!!!,poor
Yo how to turn off justin?? He pops up nonstop,poor
"Might help some, but isn't for me. It annoyed me more than it motivates me",poor
The app is so good but it's completely destroyed by the fact that it's online for most things as far as i know you need internet and the point is that you can use this even when it's offline i hope they fix it after that it deserves all 5 stars,poor
"Too complicated, too many details",poor
"Not for couples or friends. Subscription for ""teams"" to share tasks. Doesn't think money from their micro transactions shop is enough.",poor
I tried buying gems but it doesn't look like I got the gems.... But my balance in the Google pay thing has gone down. Last time I throw away money on this app. Update: the gems showed up the following day. Not sure if that's because I emailed them about it or just it took several hours to go through.,poor
The app itself is useful but they charged me three times for one subscription and will not respond to me when I email them.,poor
"The app doesn't have any option to notify you, so last I played I had difficulty forming habits",poor
"Idk what happened, but from the start app was just alright, and it was very nice and I was happy that i found it. But since a few hours it just stopped working! When I'm trying to complete the task it just doesn't count. The mark is appears, but several seconds later it vanishes!!! And also when I'm trying to complete a part of assignment it doesn't count. Please fix :(",poor
"Couldn't really understand the purpose of using the app. It's either playing games or keeping track of habits, a bit confusing.",poor
"It takes too long to be fun, and sets you up for failure. At the start you are asked to create a small # of tasks. However, the number of tasks you do is directly related to how fast you level. And a few tasks means it takes a LONG time to get to level 10 which is when you finally get to pick a class. However, you could level faster if you add more tasks, but doing that before you are ready will set you up to fail. This is not discouraged as it should be, and there few goals at lower levels.",poor
I keep running into problematic bugs right away,poor
"Was really really excited for this, but then it's glitchy (I ended up with tons of duplicates of the habits which takes forever to delete cause you can only delete individually) and it relies on internet, so I can't use it for when I'm out. Oh well :((",poor
No good as other applications but good for games and one task or goal like da daily routines work,poor
"Seems like it could be fun, I just had a hard time getting into it.",poor
fun and helpful. graphics are awesome. just needs a few tweaks. too easy to cheat. i don't like the tavern because i am in recovery from drugs and alcohol so it's kinda anthemic. maybe a temple option would be a better social forum for inclusion for those of us who don't drink and/or use drugs. it would also be nice if you could continue to see completed to-do items after you have checked them so you can continue to visualize your progress.,poor
Make a go back button,poor
"Excited to try it out, but the app crashes whenever I try to create or edit tasks!",poor
"Was ok until i saw the mtx. I guess it truely does ""gamify"" things now.",poor
"Despite various updates to ""fix bugs"" the first few screens of this app are still completely broken on Android. The app beyond sign-in still functions...but that's it. The game aspect is weak, the app isn't very well designed, and the tutorials tend to be broken on Android as well. I prefer apps like Fabulous, which I think approaches the subject of mental health and habit forming in a much better way.",poor
Set up was glitchy. I didnt get further than that. It's a great concept though and the art is cute.,poor
"Good app, but very buggy and support is completely unhelpful. There's no way to change your subscription level in the app or play store. Even if you cancel the app will think you're still subscribed. So basically when you pick a subscription level you are fully committed to it because the devs are too incompetent and uncaring to help. When using a choosing skill the habits n dailies show up like 10% of the time and the devs basically said ""oh well, we can't fix that"" when I mentioned it.",poor
"I like the concept because I've been trying to gamify my free time for a while, assigning a predifined score to each habit practiced the most during every hour, and all I wanted was the positive and the negative habits to affect the same progress bar, with the possibility to keep track of a daily score, with a possibly negative value. It's a damn shame but this aint for me. I wish it was more customisable",poor
I love the idea but it's not working on my Samsung S10e. Like the main screen is just purple when I first open and then the features for designing my character didn't show any options. I'll happily try again once bugs are worked out. Keep us posted!,poor
"1/5/20) I have tried the updates since my original post, and launch speed has slightly improved. Main Landing Page loads very slowly, but at least didn't crash right away again. Almost froze when scrolling through habits. I gave it more time to load, then tried going to a different section of the app & it crashed.. 11/9/19) Would be an awesome app, if it would load. Painfully slow startup and very laggy in app as a well. (Android 9 ; Moto G6 Play) Please fix! & I will actually update my review.",poor
Galaxy S10 on Android 10. FTUE is busted. First two slides don't load. You get to the character creation and the avatar and all of the customize options are invisible/don't display. Please fix or mark the app as incompatible with Android 10.,poor
Not very user friendly and very less interactive,poor
"Boring and not very effective for me: the visual design is a bit of a yawn and it's too hard to earn rewards without paying. If it works for you, great but it doesn't give me enough gratification.",poor
"I was using this app just fine without problems for about 2 months but when my wife decided to get us both a subscription, my account stopped working right. Whenever i check off a task i just get an error message and nothing gets counted. I did everything the helpers told me (clear cache, reinstall the app, restart phone) and nothing worked. Its been about a week and i have yet to hear again from technical support.",poor
Certain pages don't fit on screen.,poor
"Does this works on android 10? I tried installing it and tried to make a character but it seems it's bugging. Doesn't show my character (from character-making phase). Reinstalled it, same thing occurred. Hopefully you guys can help me here. Cheers!",poor
"Would you quit directing me to the website!? If I want to join a party/guild it should be done on the app. It won't let me log in on the site AT ALL.. Why you people would choose to have it so if you use ""log in using Google"", it resets and begins a whole new account without asking, now I have two accounts on one email? It won't even give me my password! I tried resetting it several times. How annoying, bad design. After I spent so much time on the app too, all for it not to work",poor
"Need Wifi/Data for it. I get that you can play with your friends, but it would be nice if I could use it without wifi for data anyway. I have a limited ammout of data and brain memory. So by the time I get home after all day I've forgotten my habits and the point becomes mute. Only gave this an extra star because I love the 8 Bit art.",poor
"The idea is wonderful. But a lot of tedious mistakes spoil the whole impression. For example, information is slowly updated even within the application, often clicking on a menu item is ignored. If you create a task without a title, but with a list, it will become closed for editing, just delete. Not all things are obvious. I had to read help to solve simple questions. Well, the old-school 8-bit graphics - not everyone likes it.",poor
"Seems to have glitched out on me. When I put in my username and display name, it gave me an error saying ""Path Profile.Name Required."" Then none of the Avatar customization options appeared. I wasn't even able to start the third page when the app crashed. Reopening the app took me to the Dailies tutorial and now I'm sure I'm missing something. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.",poor
I really liked this until I realized that unfinished daily/repeating tasks get marked as done whether you complete them or not the next day. That makes it pretty useless for tracking tasks I need to do each week.,poor
Why does the app keep showing server connection lost even though there is no problem with my network or internet server? I can't open the app and refresh it at all.,poor
Good ideas but not well implemented. It gets tedious and boring after a while.,poor
"I downloaded this app today but there is a problem that makes me unable to see to-do lists,habits etc. I really want to use this app but I can't do it when I can't see the options. It would be great if you fixed it so I can use it!",poor
"Two bugs right at the beginning of registration. First two images didn't load on the three slides intro, then when registering my info, it moved to the next screen but gave a name error and I couldn't make an avatar. Not a good first impression. Just deleted my account thru the website.",poor
"The app looks interesting but it didn't work in my device which is a Samsung Galaxy Note9 , I couldn't see the introduction and I couldn't see my character in the character creation window it kept saying path profile.file is needed I don't know how to fix it",poor
good app but skills glitch out all the time.....fix this for 5 stars,poor
Super glitchy. Too frustrating to bother trying to use it.,poor
"I'm probably too old for this. Couldn't find the energy/patience to work out how it works (and why was it preset with meditation?), I guess it would seem obvious to someone who uses technology more. Bought a huge paper planner called Trigg instead. Less portable! But it won't crash, malfunction or lost if I break my phone...",poor
"Great concept, but really quite bad execution. With so many bugs even in the new player introduction it feels like an early access, not v2.2 of anything. Surprised to learn that it's been in public release for 4 years now. I would be ashamed to make or spend money from any transaction within this game. I'm not usually this harsh, and I hope none of the devs take this review personally, but get it together. Needs a major QOL & UX overhaul before I would consider the concept v1.0 complete.",poor
"The whole app is pretty broke on the note 9 (edit: I would love to report the big to help however, the settings menue does not work so I do not have the ability to send a report).",poor
"I immediately encountered a problem when I began, by misclicking on one of my Habits. There's no way to correct for that. Manually change the values, yes, but the xp and hp don't change to reflect that automatically. Secondly, the settings page is broken on my S9, and the issue is difficult to describe. The display freezes so if you scroll, an instance of the text moves while the another is stuck below. Honestly the tutorial really needs work. I could go on but space constraints.",poor
"Laggiest experience ever, icons were missing everywhere, it seemed really cool but quite unplayable for me.",poor
"To be honest, it's a really good app. It has everything (simplicity, system, ui, etc.) but seriously, if this is really a productivity app, it needs to have an offline mode. Does it really need to have an internet connection every time someone has to check their to do list?",poor
"it is fun but now i just level up and i don't get any notifs for ""unallocated stat points"" anymore",poor
"Did not enjoy the layout, workflows, rewards, explanations. A+ for the effort.",poor
"This app is either really good or really bad/broken --- there are no in betweens. I love the concept, and its super cute, but it bugs out quite a bit and besides which, is super easy to misclick on. As a result, I've lost or accidentally lost items, as well as accidentally spending nearly all of my coins completely on accident because there's no verification for buying and no refunding??? And that's besides the part where it constantly unequips all of my gear... This game needs help...",poor
Please make it work offline!!,poor
It would be better if there are more options for customising the avatar and theme which is in purple. You will need to spend money for a decent background. The avatar is pixelated and doesn't look good. Getting a bit bored of it now.,poor
"Very nice and interesting concept but completely useless because you flipping need wifi to update your checklist?! Furthermore even if my parents didn't control my wifi and I had full access, there should be a way to see all your tasks etc at a glance without having to scroll so much. Also what's the point if you can just go in the settings and set the amount of money you want? And a bunch of my friends joined habitica only to leave because it takes up too much time, and it's not fun enough.",poor
Downloaded a bunch of these types of programs to find the one that was best. This was one of the worst. Played with it for about an hour and couldnt figure it out.,poor
"Good idea, bad execution. The first screen, with the customkze character options, wouldn't let me pick anything; therefore, I couldn't move on.",poor
"Great concept. But I didn't build up coins quickly enough, and didn't get any gems, meaning I couldn't get anything new for my character. Honestly, a calendar and check-mark system would give me more incentive than this.",poor
I really enjoyed this app but now if I delete a daily reminder I still get the notification for it! Which is highly annoying! Please fix this it distracts me from my work each time I here my notification go off for a deleted reminder,poor
Can't check of checklist items,poor
Super super buggy on my Note 8 . Can't press anything on the character creation menu after registering . Justin ( the tip guy ) ALWAYS comes up after pressing any of the menus . Super super annoying . please fix a.s.a.p,poor
Please help. Relogging in after several months disuse. It has asked me to enter a username and it's stuck on 'username taken'. Will not let me progress to the app. I've tried every random letter/number combination so it's definitely not taken. Just buggy app?,poor
Change of days in app is a major problem. I wish it would happen smoothly.,poor
"It would be a very helpful app if it actually worked the way you'd expect... if I say I want a task to be weekly, but make it so I can complete that task any day, what I'm trying to do, is make the task flexible, so I can do the weekly task whatever day of the week I feel like, instead however, making it available everyday turns it into a daily task, which I will be punished for by not completing daily, my only real solution at the moment is filling up my to-do list which is really frustrating.",poor
lost the ability to sort to dos by tags. very inconvenient. i used that feature a lot.,poor
It's slow. It'll be better if it works offline,poor
"latest update has not fixes bugs that occur every day.frustrating to use.sometimes it won't save,will just have a loading loop.Some basic things are not customizable like the calendar starting on Monday or the date format ,doesn't keep track of activity data correctly . Please focus on getting the app to work instead of focusing on superficial appearance! was thinking of paying for a subscription but what's the point if the money will not go towards making the app usable & less temperamental?",poor
it got boring fast,poor
I really enjoy this app but it has just stopped working randomly. I tried to hatch a dragon egg and the app crashed and since then I cant access it. I have tried uninstalling the app but nothing is working. I have even tried to use the website but it doesnt keep track of my exp gained. I am very dissapointed as I really like the idea of the app.,poor
"upon using the app so far, i wish that it would be accessible offline. other than that, the idea to challenge yourself to earn points for your habits and chores is quite remarkable",poor
"Just had a big visual update but if anything the app is getting worse and worse. Now most of the time when I tap a plus sign to increase count of something, nothing happens. I have to drag down to refresh and then after it thinks for a minute it'll update the count. Or not, it kind of does what it wants at this point. I've mostly stopped using it because of this.",poor
"This is terribly buggy and you're better off avoiding it; use the website instead, if you're on your mobile device. Latest update doesn't update habit counters on-screen after you press any buttons; all of the command is processed though. App still doesn't display items that are found. Just another buggy update.",poor
"Interesting concept but I get a ""path type is required"" error all the time so I stopped using it",poor
requires an account,poor
used it awhile ago and recently installed on my new phone. as soon as it opened it was clear i would not be able to use it. several things where off (like trying to put pictures in an office doc) worse still when i try to add many options are cut off by some form of white box that sits in the way. unfortunately dailies are one of the missing options and a huge part of how i personally used the app.,poor
it keeps bugging out whenever i try to do anything. it wont stop doing ghe tutorial and wont ket me delete tast and stuff.,poor
"I love the idea of this app. Unfortunately, it is not super user friendly. I've been using it for over a month and it is not very obvious how to complete quests or anything else. (and yes, I have gone through the FAQs) I finally figured out how to hatch eggs, but that's all. It's a pretty clunky app as a ""game"" but it does a pretty good job of keeping me accountable for things. That's the only reason I haven't deleted it. As a ""Gamify your life"" app, I'm not convinced. Hopefully it improves!",poor
"I quite like habitica, but this app has some issues. The biggest problem for me is that switching the to do list to ""Scheduled"" is supposed to sort the to do items by due date (that's how it works on the website), but it doesn't. That makes the to do list (in the app) useless for me.",poor
"Needs a VPN if you're in China. Some questionable UI and design choices, though the fundamentals work well for the most part. If you want to do anything remotely interesting then you have to pay, of course. And the subscription fees are absolutely extortionate. One month is the same price as a month of Netflix and a year is £47. A year of MS Office 365 with all of its functionality is £60... Let that sink in. I don't understand why, for relatively little, this app costs so much. Greed, I assume.",poor
"I couldn't get past the set-up. ""'strength is not valid enum value path 'attitude'""",poor
two stars bc i have adhd AND i REALLY wanted it to work. it isn't user friendly and i can't give it the time of day to sit and figure it out. I'll try again later.... maybe this fall?,poor
It's completely a mess. Can't understand what to do and where.,poor
Couldn't get past registration/login. I've never used the app before but when I tried to make an account it said that my email has been taken and when I went to login it just kept loading forever.,poor
Not really interesting. Doesn't help if you don't have a discipline already in place.,poor
"Great concept, but can they hire an artist, this artwork is outdated!! otherwise I would use this",poor
Too hard,poor
The dailies and habits should reset everyday.please let them reset,poor
Can do better very complex to handle for newbies.,poor
Some my tasks and habits dissappear. There aren't any in completed.,poor
would like to change my my class and chat is IMPOSSIBLE to navigate. a simple notification system would make it easy.,poor
"Great concept, but riddled with bugs. Sign up was horribly difficult, with the servers not responding and the app failing to realize I was trying to change my username and display names. App reset at around 7:00 pm, instead of at midnight of my time zone, which I had double checked beforehand. I want to like it, but this is becoming downright frustrating.",poor
this app is closing down everytime I try to do anything but daily tasks. rather frustrating...,poor
"Have been a user for years, but the app is borderline unusable at this point, it's not saving anything and is not connecting to servers. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, not sure what's wrong.",poor
"The app works great... with wifi. I love the feel of the app and desktop versions, but a decent chunk of my day is spent with limited/no wifi. I can't recommend it for that.",poor
"Bug that says 'path 'type' is required' everytime I try to do something. I tried submittinf an error report through menu - about - report a bug, but I get the same error message when I try report the bug",poor
"Awesome App.... BUT, soo many bugs!!",poor
"I like the concept, but the execution needs work. In my experience, the app was laggy non-responsive at times which made the experience of creating and managing tasks tedious.",poor
Not user-friendly,poor
"Incredible tool, awful app. I'd recommend the desktop version of this site to anyone but the app is a bug-ridden mess that overcomplicates simple functions and only works about 90% of the time.",poor
It's been really helpful for habit building but it's now bugging like crazy and crashing every time I open it so not wonderful.,poor
"it's a great idea but it just doesn't work! The pages never refresh for the next day, and if i press the refresh button it just comes up with an unable to connect to server error, or just stays with the loading symbol infinitely. I went on it today after not going on it for a couple of days and i just find that im dead out of nowhere. The ""refill health"" prompt kept repeatedly popping up and then when it stopped my health bar was still at zero. Also the add habit button isnt there always...",poor
"The idea behind the app is nice, but it isn't userfriendly. Finding and adding friends to use it together was so counter productive that it got us to waste time we could be actually doing our daily tasks.",poor
Heres the thing. I love this app and the idea behind it. But for some reason its so dang glitchy. Pages wont always change when i scroll. Tasks dont refresh. I often have to completely close the app. Help! Very willing to change this review to 5 stars if we get this figured out.,poor
"I wanted to use this app. The concept is really good. But I won't use it simply because it barely functions. For starters it's online only... but as if that wasn't enough the sync on Android is just all over the place - the app would sometimes ask ""have you done these things today?"" for tasks that were scheduled the day before or at 1 AM for tasks on that day... Speaking of tasks, I couldn't set up multiple repeating tasks for certain days of the week (per task, wanted to fill the whole week with various tasks and repeat them) for some reason, they would all sync to same weekdays. I enabled reminders but never had a reminder come up once and as far as I researched online this is a common problem on Android and hasn't been resolved for some time. So it seems I have to create a habit of opening this habit tracker app...",poor
this app would be 100x better if it incorporated some of the editting/customizing functions of the other to-do-list apps out there. i want to be able to strike through each of the to do items and view deleted/archived/completed items. be able to choose colors etc ..,poor
the app is awesome. but it made my phone drain 30% battery per day in the background which makes it useless,poor
Very buggy and doesn't always show whole pages or lists.,poor
Sadly the UI isn't adapted for the Pixel 3 XL,poor
"Let's be honest here, if you need help with basic habit management, you won't use this regularly enough to help. And if you're organized and have a good routine, you don't need it. A pointless novelty at best.",poor
Clunky and very slow to load. Not fun at all - just yet another task I had to deal with daily.,poor
"Several navigation options are inaccessible because they're underneath the home/back/tasks buttons at the bottom or within the notification/notch area at the top, making this app hard to use on my phone.",poor
The app was working fine until it started bugging out recently and showing me the wrong dailies. Going back to using just the website now until this is fixed.,poor
"This app is a great idea with poor execution. Reminders only sometimes appear, and the UI can be very unresponsive - I've checked daily tasks off, only to find that the app interpreted this as UNchecking the task (since it hadn't registered the fact that it is a new day, yet), which actually subtracts the game resources from you. These problems are significant enough to make the RPG-like rewards system ineffective for me, and the app not worth using as a habit-tracker at this time, sadly.",poor
"I'm a breath away from uninstalling this app again. Half the time it doesn't even do what it's supposed to do, some things it doesn't even let you do inside the app, you have to go to the actual browser version to do it. On that subject, the mobile browser is beyond awkward, no chance of navigating it properly! If I'm supposed to log into an actual PC just to check off that I did a workout or washed dishes, forget it. Right now the only reward I get is having my good mood ruined; certainly not worth it.",poor
Good concept but lack basic functionality,poor
The app itself is quite good but without offline mode it's useless for me.,poor
"No landscape mode for tablets. I like the browser version, but landscape support is essential to me.",poor
"This app would be so much better if it didn't penalize you for doing your habits for many days in a row. Instead of getting more experience, coins, you get less the longer you do something. You should be rewarding the habits that people are building, not telling them that once they have the Habit they're going to get less for it. Otherwise, this app would get five stars for me.",poor
"It's a good app but it doesn't really work for me. Please provide an offline mode, because not everyone has data and Wi-Fi throughout the whole day. I will rate it 5 stars once there is an offline mode.",poor
"It's a great app. Really nice features. Does everything it says on the tin. But let me tell you: a productivity app won't do what it's meant to do unless it's usable offline. I really loved using it, but now I'm going back to the good old bullet journal.",poor
"I honestly didn't get much chance to use the app before it stopped connecting and not letting me do anything. Before that happened i started setting up daily tasks and the part where you set how often (such as the days of the week) you do each task was confusing. I would change the days on one task and it would change it for all of them. Over all, too much work for its worth. Loved the idea though, it would have really gotten me doing things to level up and collect items",poor
Doesn't connect at all. Pls fix it,poor
This app seemed very interesting until I got into the app and at the very start of it it made itself very clear that this app is geared towards women. The avatar customization part all the hair and accessories were for women. App seemed cool but unwelcoming for guys.,poor
"The app's concept is very misleading. I was promised gameplay and if it really is in here, I'm having a rough time finding it.",poor
"It's a great idea and I think I'd really love it. But it's unusable offline and as someone who doesn't have access to WiFi all the time, that makes it impossible to work with.",poor
"Google login does not work for me. In freshly instead app I can tap login

phone and storage permissions * Manually clearing app data and cache * 
Reinstalling the app Nothing worked.",poor
"Thought it was great... until I opened the app to mark off a task only to

Doesn't work,poor
"Excellent idea but poor execution. There really isn't much to do game wise 
especially since the majority of the content is locked behind a paywall. I 
understand that they have to monetize it but at 1 million users, ad 
impressions may have been a better route instead of a subscription service 
that locks out the majority of your player base from the start. There's 
also no way to earn crystals other than paying. With so little to do and so 
much unavailable unless you pay (with no options to try before you buy) 
gives me little motivation to come back. Some advice: ●Make the quests you 
can buy with gold cheaper. 200 coins takes forever to grind and there's not 
much to do otherwise. ● Have a way for f2p players to earn crystals (maybe 
through daily login bonuses, level up bonuses or grind and buy them with 
gold). ●Offline capabilities especially for checklists and tasks. I 
shouldn't need the internet to check off my to do list. ●Have the ability 
to choose your class at the start and allow players to change class 
whenever they'd like. Having to wait until you're level 10 is too much of a 
grind. ●Have a little more customization available from the start (maybe a 
freeby starter egg or a background or outfit). Literally everything is 
locked behind crystal pay walls...even the character backgrounds are a 
whopping 15 crystals . That just screams greedy.",poor
"A fine app, except for all the bugs. Any cosmetic aspirations you were 
hoping to have as a motivator (character customization, equipment, colors 
and more) all do not display. Not only that but an error message pops up 
every time I perform an action. Really hope they patch the bugs. I dare not 
use anything else than the checklist.",poor
"I really used to love this app but mobile push notifications stopped 
working, there's been a ton of bugs lately, and it's just not motivating 
like it used to be. When I reported the bugs I was told to email someone 
instead and I'm at a point where I just uninstalled. :/ maybe I'll return 
in a year or so",poor
"Samsung note8 was unable to get past the ""what tasks would you like to work 
on?"" Screen the next screen selection was blocked out no matter was 
selected or un selected. However the back button still worked",poor
"It's a gamified checklist, which is a good start, But ultimately not enough 
to follow through on the core idea. There's no actual game here, nothing to 
do, and no true incentive to keep you coming back. An upsetting amount of 
content is gated behind purchases and I found my interest waning once I ran 
out of things to look forward to. Also, the fact that it takes until Level 
10 to be allowed to switch classes is insane.",poor
"Honestly, it's kind of dull compared to the web version. You should add 
more colors, because the current interface is kind of bland. I cheat with 
the mobile version but stay focused on the web. Needs some more effort and 
work being done. The greatest thing about this is the parties, and I love 
that you can use accounts, but the android platform seems a bit inferior to 
the web version. Still like it , though. Has some opportunity. EDIT: 
horrible on Android. Trash. Absolutely trash. Great on web, incompetent on 
mobile.",poor
"Unfortunately, I keep getting connection errors. Other apps are connecting 
fine. I like the app, but it's useless in the nonworking state on my phone 
right now.",poor
"I was able to set up my account just fine, but I apparently made the mistake of resetting the tutorial to better understand the UI. I kept getting the same ""welcome! Here's what you can do with the app!"" tutorial. Eventually it started to hang, so I got fed up and uninstalled. The UI looks nice, but that doesn't mean it's usable. I had a hard time figuring out the differences between the different areas to set up things you want to improve on. The terminology isn't understandable (no clue as to what separates Habits from Dailies from Tasks), and unfortunately, because I still couldn't understand what I was supposed to do and where, it's not very usable for me. The bug that left me in tutorial/hanging hell was enough. I had it installed got a grand total of 10 minutes, and I don't have the patience to wait out however long it'll take the developer to fix it.  Phone: Google Pixel. Latest version of Android as of 17 March.",poor
"Too casual, cannot create routines for specific days only. App assumes that every day is exactly the same. Stats are random and don't represent actual skills. I prefer life rpg + time time + pomodoro app.",poor
"I really really want to like this app.  I can get as far as setting up and tracking tasks, which is awesome. But as soon as I try to form a party and battle monsters, it runs up against some issue with Google authentication (I think) and I can't go any farther. I even tried to delete my account and start over, but when you get to the step were it says ""type delete in all caps""... there is no keyboard or place to type.   So yeah, great concept, but it has some fatal bugs.",poor
"Please hire some competent Android developers, throwing up ""can't connect to the server"" messages 6 times in a row when I switch networks is just pathetic",poor
"I seriously don't understand. The basic functions of the app are so janky and broken. In the avatar creation, I had to keep pressing the options I wanted over and over for it to actually work, then when I finished the avatar had options I didn't pick. Every habit defaults to being both positive and negative. I know there has to be some default, but it's kind of weird that if I have a positive habit I have to tap the negative button. Adding tags is really clunky because the tags have to be added to the filter, (I guess it works but it's unintuitive to have to add a tag to the filter instead of just tagging the task itself) but when I add them they don't immediately get added. They disappear and then get added a few minutes later. Half the time it won't let me move around the tasks. Sometimes the FAQ text pops up overlaying whatever screen I'm on. Switching between habits, dailies, to-dos, and rewards is finicky. Sometimes swiping doesn't work, sometimes trading the icon doesn't work. I have to tap things in the equipment menu multiple times for them to work. Same for the avatar menu. With patience all this stuff does eventually work, but it's tedious to just use the app. The app would be 10 times better just by fixing the buggy menus",poor
"Glitches abound. Inputs ignored, not given options to make habits at points",poor
"It honestly saddens me to write this review. Habitica used to be an amazing app. I need it for all of my dailies and to-dos, but ever since the code was migrated, the app has been nigh unusable. At the moment I can't even login. When I finally manage to, my dailies and to-dos don't show up. It's a struggle to mark a daily as completed because it takes forever for the server to recognize that I tapped on the daily. Overall, this app needs to be reworked. I really hope things can be fixed because I want to keep using this app. Otherwise I'll have to find something else.",poor
"Fix the thing (idk is that a bug of anything else), I hardly click the ""next"" button (or text). And its look like nothing's loading, makes me wait and think ""is it loading or not?"" then I restart the app but it became worse, my character not loaded, and the button became harder to click 😑",poor
Aeesome concept but very buggy and laggy. Won't register my taps in some places. It skipped my tutorial because it wouldn't register my taps to continue.,poor
"Not a good start. The ideas are sound, and I've gone in with hopes. But I ran into issue after issue right at the start. Can't get glasses to select. Can't add my beard or moustache without gems. Can't even party with my wife because of redirect errors. I like this idea a lot, and my wife adores this. If these get fixed, I'll edit and bump up the rating.",poor
"Great idea, riddled with bugs. I can't use the app at all without an data connection, which is annoying because there's no internet related interface that I've seen so far. I have notifications set up that work maybe twice a week. I really want to use this app, but the bugs make it hard.",poor
"Habitica is great on browser, and indeed has helped me tons to manage my routines, but the app itself doesn't function properly. Now I can't even scroll down the pages to pick dailies that are further down, or habits, sometimes a newly hatched pet won't appear, and neither will food, and it doesn't tell how much damage I'm doing to a boss. And the browser version has some bugs too, sometimes logging in it will display in Pt DESPITE being set to English (I assume it's my browser's settings, but the page's options SHOULD prevail over), and synching will sometimes take gold, health or mana away randomly. Still kicks the app's ass in every way.",poor
The bugs are annoying and keep it from being a better app Update: still has way too many bugs that never get fixed. Downgrading from 3 to 2 stars,poor
"It's pretty good. I really like the concept. The app itself and the web app is super buggy. So hard to invite friends to parties and the web app is really slow. Otherwise, it's a great game  Edit: app got even buggier. Sync is slow and pressing on habits doesn't work sometimes. Web app is better.  [Update] The app is still horrible but I've stuck to it because of the mechanics. I've been keeping up with my habits but I really wish they'd fixed the mobile app!",poor
"Couldn't get buttons to function in the beginning, couldn't you even start or set up anything besides the avatar",poor
"Amazing idea however the programming is just not good. Its very slow and buggy and just makes the whole thing completely unenjoyable. Its ashame to see that performance issues have not been fixed over so mamy years of this being out. If these issues get fixed, id easily give it a 5",poor
The idea is great but the design is cumbersome and counter intuitive. I bought gems but was unable to set up challenges due to a bug in the app.,poor
"Went for this because of the graficzne theme, found it boring - uninstalled.",poor
"Wish sync was fixed, it takes a lot of manual refreshing to do basic tasks such as refresh for the day or reload when you've died. UI could be better too. I wish there was slightly more focus on the social side of it. Also slow, unresponsive, and unreliable really. Good idea, but not great execution. Going to move on to a different app now after all this time.",poor
Difficult to use,poor
Yeah.. Too many bugs.,poor
"The idea is great, I've tried so many habit tracker apps and this one is one of the best, but I hate that it doesn't work offline.",poor
This app has a lot of bugs that need to be worked out. The iOS version is a lot better.,poor
"Way overcomplicated. Dailies don't turn red if you miss them. I don't know how often you are supposed to perform habits. Sync is bad (there is no local application state/model, and network glitches are disastrous). However graphics are cute.",poor
I keep tapping and it's just unresponsive. It seems like a fun app but to keep tapping and not getting anywhere is annoying It just stops... Please fix seems like a fun app to try out,poor
"I love Habitica and have used it for years, but this app has a pretty bad UI and is full of bugs. Disappointing.",poor
"Doesn't work on Moto X Pure. Far too slow to handle it I think. Seemed like a good idea, but I can't access the features to make it workable.",poor
"I used to swear by Habitica for a long time, but frankly I find it almost unusable. The biggest, most important problem is the way sync works. You can't use Habitica if offline (or have bad internet connection), you can't click several buttons in quick succession, and you are never sure if clicking a button actually sends data to server, Android widgets are absolutely unusable. Habitica's manual frames it as if it's not their, but user's fault.  I have more than a dozen of Habits and about the same amount of Dailies, most of which are themselves checklists. I keep track of multiple habits, therefore I open Habitica and press + and - many times a day, sometimes several times in an hour. If every time I try to register a Habit or a Daily I must worry about Habitica not syncing properly, then it robs me of time and mental energy. Which makes it useless for actually instilling habits.",poor
"The UX is horribly clunky and it takes more than two clicks just to do anything. Coming from Todoist to this is like a bird flying into tar pit! All the habit and time management improving features are sort of stuck behind the horrible UI. Why do I need to see soooo many boxes and options when I just want to and a single to-do. Further more, why does it take 2 taps just to get to that screen in the first place?! If I'm on the Todo tab, I probably want to add a to-do. I honestly haven't seen an app this bad in years.",poor
"This app works awfully. Its a great idea but it needs tons of improvements. Connection improvements, offline actions (like completing a daily, which can be checked later), etc...  I NEED THE PAYING BUTTONS TO WORK, I CAN'T BUY 4 gems... Seriously, do you want to get ever paid? Do something with this... thing. Again it's a great idea, but that's the only reason why I keep using it, besides that, its a complete mess...",poor
"I really want to love this but it's just so buggy. I'd happily pay money for a working version of this app, but not in its current state.",poor
"Cool idea. Lousy execution. For one, the app is horribly unresponsive. I also encountered bugs all over and a crash within 5 or 10 minutes of using and figuring out the app.",poor
Great concept but i just cant do quests,poor
"The app is soooooooo laggy!!!  Always pop up and say no internet connection.  And fail to sync.  Loved and used the web for a awhile ,but the app? Meh",poor
"This app is not working without internet connection, it's unacceptable for the task manager!",poor
"This is a good idea, but not so well executed. The app itself is buggy. Text lags, buttons are unresponsive, and resetting the tutorial makes it repeat every single time you open one of the tabs. First impression were so poor... that I don't want to use this app to help my tasks and habits...",poor
"Where do I add a new Habit? (not a daily, not a to-do)",poor
"The app used to be great until the update some time ago. Now it consistently crashes on my phone and very, very rarely loads correctly, if at all, on my PC.",poor
There are too much connection errors and bugs and they are really annoying. Please fix it.,poor
"I was excited to use this app and love the categories and reward system for habits, dailies, to-do. After a few days and several rookie mistakes that aren't explained well in the tutorial, I realized this app is way too heavy on the game mechanics for my use. I want to have a list of dailies to partially complete everyday, to encourage reading and writing every now and then, not everyday. This app punishes you for not checking these things off everyday. I totally didn't realize my character was losing tons of health until it hit the red zone. I then started reading up on the death mechanic and am very turned off. I can understand wanting to give the players consequences for missing a task, but it shouldn't be health loss and it should account for how the player uses the dailies (must complete everyday or bonus if completed). They also do not make it easy to provide feedback. All the discussion links either required creating a separate account (different from the habatica account) or were closed threads. This app could be so fun but I feel it loses sight of promoting good habits/organization. I love gaming, but this is super heavy handed mechanics to me. Would keep using this app if I could keep the lists alone.",poor
it's absolutely fine but can be a bit laggy/temperamental,poor
"I'm so disappointed here. I've read other reviews talk about the site being much better, but here is the reality of that. A majority of internet users don't use full browsers to surf it. So this app had to be good, because your habits are a private and important thing. And it's absolutely not good. The last (but not only) straw was when parts of a menu are rendering in completely the wrong place, and won't clear. Inviting people to your party was way too confusing, until I found out it didn't even work until I did it manually *on the site*. There's more, but I won't bother. I know its supposed to be open source but is ANY testing happening? I was trying to be an advocate for this and you guys just killed it for me with this bad app.",poor
"Really buggy right now. There's no way to create a party on the app, and I can't even join one. The website can't seem to log me in and if I click on any of the links on the FAQ page, it takes me back to the homepage. Also, tasks are listed in the order which I put them and not in the order that they expire.. so I have to check each task for the date and time of expiry. Not only that, the dates are displayed weirdly.. some have dd/mm/yy format while others have mm/dd/yy. Developers have much work to do.",poor
"I wouldn't have given such a low rate if it wasn't for my honest disappointment, and I promise to change to 5 starts the moment I'm reassured that things got better. This concept is amazing, and the idea is just brilliant. However, this is by far the buggiest app I've ever had on my Android, and the UI is just not well thought of. Guys, please work on the bugs so I won't have to click 1,000 times before I get feedback that something happened, won't have to reopen the app and lose all the initial welcome tour with all the choices, won't have to use my full name without being able to change it because I signed up with Google.... These things seem basic to me. I really hope it will get better, this app could be a life changer!",poor
"I ended up giving up on this app. A few years back I used it frequently, and now recently I came back, but it's just incredibly frustrating how it always returns server or internet errors and doesn't save my changes. It's a real pity because it was a very fun app to use.",poor
"I love the layout, structure and simplicity of this app. But it has one critical failure There is no way to view stats except how many times you have done a thing. ""Make the bed"" 23 times. In what timeframe? A month? A year? What is the percentage of days it has been made/not made? The only thing I feel like I have to show for this is virtual items. If you would add satisfaction with good stats I would rate 5/5! Kindest regards William",neutral
"I hate to give this app 3 stars, because I love Habitica. But while the website is fine, the app has some problems. 1. I couldn't find a way to turn off push notifications from new messages in your party's chat. This would be very useful to users in large parties. 2. I couldn't find a way to sort backgrounds by what I own. I don't want to have to scroll all the way down looking for my old ones. 3. I couldn't find a way to delete only some of the tasks from a broken challenge.",neutral
"I love the concept a lot but the actual ""gaming"" aspect of it leaves a lot to be desired. If there was something we could do or level up to or actually fight. Maybe pokemon sort of format for the game. That would really make it better and keep someone interested",neutral

"The latest update has shrunk the buttons, and I can no longer use this app to check off my dailies.",neutral
"Its a great concept. But i wish it had more engaging gameplay wherein we could actually fight bosses, dungeons etc. Without that those upgrades seem useless. Hope you try adding such a feature.",neutral
it would be so much better if you could walk around in the game and build stuff and talk to npc's like add a animal crossing/minecraft aspect to it that would be a whole lot more fun,neutral
didnt work out for me,neutral
"This app is amazing, it has a very user friendly interface. I'd say its great for developing habits, making short daily task list. But the only downside is there is no calendar view. So I can't plan ahead and time things for the long run. Thats why I'm giving it 3 stars",neutral
"The idea is wonderful, truly. But problems exist:
1) Bugs: to-do list, and dailies keep being empty. Refreshing doesn't work, only close and reopen app.
2) Monthly subscription seems highly excessive - I don't like paying for a service that remains static. This could, and should IMO, be an offline app. Particularly with the existing obvious bugs, payment is out of the question right now.
3) Tutorial is lacking: I had to figure a few things out by myself as a first time user.",neutral

"This app seems great. i've seen other apps gamifying your life, but what i feels really works, is that you can make a party of friends, and get productive together, while clearing dungeons and getting loot. if you make a group of friends, be aware that even if its just your friends in the group, a single swearword will get you banned. not a warning or anything, straight up banned. i got banned because i called my close friend a F-word C-word. mind you not in public, but in our little group, where that sort of banther is normal between us. Mind you, i'd never talk to anyone like that in a public group. i don't mind policing the language of users if they are abusive or using foul language like that in public, but to me its a bit much to ban people for a private conversation, where there was no victims, but its not within my power to change the community guidelines. hopefully i'll get unbanned so i can give the app a swing. it does seem great. only 3 stars for being so quick to jump the ban hammer. will definetly change stars for the better, if the community guidelines loosen up in regards to private conversations and partys. maybe add a report button instead?",neutral

This app seems to make me want to procrastinate more?,neutral
This app has a fantastic concept that being an MMO style game based around your success in real life. The game is entirely server based and I have a good internet connection but the app would constantly disconnect.

"Ok I like it, but know what? The experience points keep expanding but not with health. Simultaneously, you will be sent backward everytime you lose your health while to refill health you need to max up the exp point. Please fix this",neutral
Is there any ways to see your progress in graphic? Like daily task you've done and see it in graphic stats or something? Because i can seems to find one in the apps or did i miss something? I wsnt to know and compare my tasks daily. The UI and everything is good tho except for that graphical stats daily i cant find one here dev,neutral
"It's fun, a great concept, but the app itself needs work. It locks up constantly and has to be manually shut down and then re-started, and the reminders basically don't work at all. Honestly I think it would be best to remove the reminder feature for now until it can be fixed, because not having a way to set one at all is better than using the feature and thinking you'll get a needed reminder when you won't because it doesn't actually work.",neutral
I like the app and it's a pity that I won't keep on using it because of the absence of monthly overview for dailies which I need most from a habit tracker instead of useless strikes,neutral
"Game is great, can give back results where you put in effort. However when I last tried to put in a task everything was empty and I cant seem to log back in.",neutral
"The game is very buggy, I just bought a reward, then the app crashed, and the gold I've spent is gone, but I didn't receive the reward. These kind of experiences unfortunately decrease the gaming fun tremendously, and it could be such a good game otherwise!",neutral
"Love the idea but the app is so buggy and not too user friendly at points. First off, I can't change my character when creating an account because nothing pops up. It's just missing so I end up with a female characters. I have Galaxys10 and tried reinstalling app but nope, seems to be just a bug. Also, changing outfits just seems terrible to scroll through (the not user friendly part) The Good Idea is amazing! I really want this app to improve so I can incorporate this into my daily life.",neutral
"This is a good app to motivate, but wished there would be analytics to show progress like graphs, etc.",neutral
Looks good but lack of dark mode kills it for my phone. I can't stand any app that's mostly bright b white. Went with LifeRPG instead.,neutral
"Love the app. Love the rewards. But, I wish that it showed you past dates and all you accomplished on days previous, and I wish that the coloring of tasks wasn't so complicated when getting close to red or blue or whatever. Also, certain things are hard to navigate... but overall, I absolutely love this app. Use it every day. Not so much for challenges or battles, but for habit making and to do's.",neutral
I really love the idea this app has but it has some bugs. The first 2 pages are blank and when i had to make my character everything was blank too. After updating the app it was still the same. (Im using a samsung s8 if thats important) Hope you guys fix it cuz i'd love to use the app.,neutral
"The concept is inventive, but the execution simply makes this app less than enticing to use.",neutral
"App has been useful in helping me keep track of tasks and all, but lately the alarms I set on my dailies haven't been going off at all. Which is... unfortunate, because they're all to remind me to eat...",neutral
"First two slides doesn't load, the character in character creation & menu items are invisible, pls fix.",neutral
It doesn't work offline and when I'm actually online I need also a vpn to use it :-(,neutral
The to do list should allow prioritizing tasks by importance and urgency. It would be great if you could add that.,neutral
"Had a great experience when I was using it thru browser but when i installed it on my phone, it wouldnt record all my progress and tasks on my phone application. Even with the same account. Please work it out, I would love to keep using thru my phone.",neutral
"I really like this, however I'm not able to stay with it for long periods of time. This one and others I've tried and I just can't stay motivated....",neutral
"I liked, but in my cellphone had some bugs (galaxy A8+). I think if this app had a function to sync with the phone calendar (google calendar or samsung calendar) it would be much better",neutral
It seems so cool and I wanted to use it as soon as possible but it wont even let me log in. It takes 1second to load and then nothing happens,neutral
"Cute, but seems like it would benefit from a way to set eg monthly or annual reminders for bills and birthdays without going to a Google script.",neutral
"It's a cool app and it kinda helps me but you are forced to be a warrior. It says you can change your class in the settings, but there is no option.",neutral
"Friend was permabanned for calling another friend a ""mad c**t*"" in party chat, but here in Australia that's a compliment... TL;DR over-sensitive language filter, should allow party chat to be unfiltered.",neutral
"It needs a better way to Schedule the to do list. An easy way to schedule your day, week and even month. It needs a calendar to see things with a bird eye view. I like the game thing, but it needs more functions and to be more practical.",neutral
App is amazing but ios version is so much better than android version. It has many other settings while this one lacks them. i hope this gets fixed so i can change my rate to 5 stars.,neutral
"Não consigo mudar a linguagem, já fui nas opções e tudo mas sempre atualiza e fica no inglês.",neutral
"Okay But I wish it had options to increase exp and stays for example when you read a book gain x intuition when you run x times you gain x stamina, etc etc and get rewards and level that way. Gives more motivation for doing those things.",neutral
"Disappointed. Had the app installed for a few weeks only, I was enjoying it and improving my life and suddenly it stopped working. I keep getting notifications saying that there's no connection, I can't log anything, and once I decided to reinstall again and again, I can't even log in anymore. The screen won't load and it never goes past the login/register screen.",neutral
All my tasks are gone and unable to load anything.,neutral
The concept is great and it's a fun way to keep track of your habits. My only gripes are: -I wish there was a better way to see habit streaks. The number is cool but if we could see it on a calendar like view I think that would be helpful. You could miss a day and if streaks aren't set to reset the number remains unchanged. -Better explanation of the colors on streaks. I still don't know what they mean (going to Google it). -You can't use rogue skills because you get a blue screen.,neutral
"Ребят, конечно круто что вы сделали это в виде игры. Только вот, вы бы могли доработать такие вещи: - сбивается сортировка задач после выхода из приложения. Я хочу чтобы у меня постоянно была сортировка по не выполненим ежедневным задачам. - я закрыла прогу на вкладке ""ежедневные задачи"" . Хочу чтобы при повторном открытии она была также на этой вкладке.",neutral
"Neat concept, just not for me.",neutral
Why it is not giving me notifications for dailies?,neutral
Fantastic idea!!! I've actively been seeking something just like this for a long time. But the app itself is super glitchy. Most things wont load and everything keeps resetting. It might be my connection or my phone. I'm not sure. Hoping I can figure it out cause I love this!,neutral
######please make offline version because most of studious people cannot afford online apps so if you want good ratting please make part 2 offline,neutral
I like this app but this is the buggiest app i ever had i been using this for years and still havent fix them,neutral
"Great idea, it needs some improvements imo. Edit: after playing for a while i noticed some things that definitely need improvement. Faster loading times when changing sections or when receiving items, you shouldn't have to refresh to see them. That also applies when feeding pets where i dont see a progress in the bar unless i refresh. Etc.",neutral
"Enjoying the app so far, but the widgets are quite limiting. You cannot use check lists in the widgets, and sometimes they update rather weirdly. I have also had UI bugs throughout, but they haven't affected me too much. Overall good, but just needs some tweaking to make it more solid. That's not to say the service is bad. Just the mobile app.",neutral
Love this app. Its helped me with my motivation and procrastinating. I've been more motivated since using it. But I'm having a very frustrating issue that is driving my OCD insane. I try to move a task in my list... Only for it to disappear or move itself somewhere I didn't tell it to go. I try to keep my list in a certain order of how i should get things done and this is not helping me at all.,neutral
I love it. But the app keeps crashing when I try to invite friends to party and I can't buy gems.,neutral
Force closes when trying to create challenge,neutral
"I've been actively using this and I love the concept. App version could really use a new UI. Dark mode would be appreciated, and maybe letting users adjust Font or size of boxes. (Feels too large right now. It would easily hold more details, but space is lost to a big box)",neutral
It miss my data after updating.i can't use it easily.,neutral
"Decent app. Fun concept. Biggest issue right now is that some of the dailies that are supposed to be once per week are still showing up as an every-day task, which is very annoying. Sometimes the dailies will cross over into the to-do list for an hour or so at a time, too.",neutral
The app is great except for being internet dependant and lacking an undo button or a button lock for unintended log entries I know there is an edit your character section but there is no record of past entries to use as reference,neutral
Its a very good game and I like it but to buy most things in the game you have to get gems or a subscription which you both to pay for. Also I don't seem to get anything when I purchase the enchanted Armoire.,neutral
"It is a great idea, don't get me wrong, but why the need for a chat room?",neutral
"Over the years the platform has become stagnant. I was a huge proponent of Habitica, using it for a few years and even paying for a subscription to support development; but development beyond bug fixes never happened. It's a good tool with a potent gamification component, but they've failed to continue to make it engaging and interesting—and certainly not worth paying to support.",neutral
miss the dark theme,neutral
"Gamification is good designed but the app works kind of laggy, 5 star when redesigned",neutral
The app is what you expect.,neutral
Having some equipment related bugs,neutral
"Parece una gran app, pero no se me actualiza el idioma a español, a pesar de que ya lo configure para que asi sea. Una lastima",neutral
"Nice and useful app. Feels quite buggy though, and the party chat goes the wrong way if you're used to any other chat app.",neutral
Too complex as a game! The time I spent tried to understanding how it work could have been spent actually working!,neutral
"I love Habitica and I like the UI of the updated app, but I find it frustrating that the app doesn't show all the content that the website does. Normally this is just a small annoyance--but now, after paying for a Group plan for my family, I'm discovering that my kids can't access the group tasks list via the app! Which makes the entire thing a waste of money since the whole point was to be able to create tasks for family chores. Please tell me a fix is in the works!",neutral
"I've just installed this as and won't be using it due to it requiring you to create an account and login. It sounds like a fantastic app, but I'd much rather my data was stored locally where only I have access to it.",neutral
"useless, as you can not group habits, but gamifying idea is good, maybe they will fix it",neutral
Good idea but this isn't for me. I am much more for classic habit apps.,neutral
I really enjoyed the experience of using this app i like it but it doesn't work offline so I can't use it properly so please make it offline or at least se fundamental features.,neutral
I really enjoy this app up until about an hour ago. all of a sudden during a quest my party disappeared and my friends messaged me to ask what happened. I have also tried to join a help guild to ask but the app wont let me join a guild or post in chat at all now. please fix this bug so me and my friends can enjoy the app.,neutral
I'd love to see class selection. as an option when you start the game. I was forced to be warrior without an option to change. I even went to setting and nothing there to change it either...,neutral
"The app is pretty good, but I wish there was a way to put weekly tasks in. I tried setting up a task that would go off weekly but I still lost health for not completing it daily. It would be nice to be able to put repeating tasks on the app that you don't do every day, but repeat on a schedule, like laundry every Sunday or something.",neutral
I love this app but the latest update is buggy and does not record when I check off tasks. Please fix!,neutral
a great app! has some kinks that need ironing and I'll update when they're done. But I love this app and use it daily - as intended 😊,neutral
"This app has done a good job of helping me keep track of tasks. Dailies, Habits, and the To Do with checklists have been wonderful. I just don't like the new redesign. Nothing looks to be where it should be to me. It now feels bulky and clunky, and I feel like it will make me use it a lot less because it is now uncomfortable to look at.",neutral
"Idea is cool (not for everyone); I'm removing 1 star for not having any charts for the habits themselves; and 1 star for the funky behavior of tasks screen - I'd edit some task from Dailies and after it's saved, I'm placed back to Habits, for example.",neutral
best,neutral
"Finally is working, but I had to erase the data on my cellphone =/ Later I'm going to check what happened with the avatar. Until then the rating gonna stay still",neutral
why doesn't adjusting habit streak reflect in health and experience (say if i accidentally clicked + or - for a habit)?,neutral
"Bug: message cannot be displayed on app! Android 9, nokia 6.1 plus",neutral
idk if its my phone (android) but i dont receive push notifications nor reminder for this app :/,neutral
Interesting and promising but not refined or intuitive. Chat function is one of the worst I've ever encountered.,neutral
"Love the app, but I have a question. In the options under daily tasks, we can choose between Daily or weekly, What's the difference?",neutral
Missing a few good features and isn't always the most stable of apps,neutral
"The website is buggy, but enjoyable. The app, however, feel almost nonfunctional.",neutral
Fix the glitch where if you want to change the streak of a daily the keyboard pops up and gos down. super annoying,neutral
"The big CONS to this app: DAILIES tab always shows all of my weekly duties, instead of the DAILY ones. I change this in the filter but once I reopen the app, it switches back to showing EVERYTHING. What's the point of a filter when the app doesn't save it? (Galaxy Note 8) Also, why is there no dark mode? My eyes are screaming at night.",neutral
"I have been using this app for a while, really trying to get to grips with it but I've come to conclude that it's not me. If you feel like you need less complexity in your life them this probably isn't for you as this adds a new system that you have to get to grips with and plus the gamification aspect can be quite destracting and finnecky. I think if this were to ever be useful for me it would need a separate environment for tasks, habits and dailies.",neutral
Edit: Reverted to old version or something and issues are back :( Edit: Issue fixed and new update is great! Seems like you actually passed the issue along instead of making complaining subscriber have to repeat the complaint in email... Huge fan of Habitica. Used it for years. It was called HabitRPG when I started. Only to-do list app I have stuck to. Encourages you to build good habits in a fun way. Community-built. No ads...worth subscribing to support the app.,neutral
fun way to track habits. It would be great if you could update tasks without an interent connection and then just sync the next time your connected like many other trackers,neutral
"This app is very helpful! Total game changer for my ADHD. Unfortunately, after level 25 the app becomes a money grab and the items you find and the equipment you can buy with coins get severely capped. But overall I'm happy this app exists, it really helps me stay on track :) Perhaps if the game cost a few dollars to purchase the developers wouldn't need to resort to capping in order to create revenue from the app. I feel as though many people will quit once the RPG element is restricted.",neutral
"Having to find players to be able to do anything is a bit annoying, it's really boring otherwise. Reminders don't work properly - I set a bunch for last night that never happened, and a bunch this morning that never happened. It's not really built for proper daily routines including things you need to do twice per day so... It's not really useful for me.",neutral
"Incredibly useful service and thanks so much for creating it. The app tends to be buggy, but nothing that couldn't easily be worked around until the last update. Since the last update drag and drop sorting of To Do (and I suspect Dailies as well) subtasks/checklists no longer works which is really frustrating. At least the website works great as always. It's just frustrating to have to run down to the computer to fix my lists.",neutral
"Latest update is super buggy; can't change if I want my dailys to be every 2 days, 3 days, etc. because the keyboard jumps up and immediately disappears. Really annoying.",neutral
"Loving it! But are there themes on the horizon? Not a huge fan on purple! And where can see a weekly/monthly summary of how I'm keeping up with my dailies? Also I noticed a bug when I accidentally hit 'create' multiple times for a new daily, it will create multiple instances of it.",neutral
"nice, but not what I need for now",neutral
it has great promise but i cant use it offline so its worthless to me.,neutral
"Cool concept, but I don't have the attention span for it.",neutral
"very good app, but i wish it can be used offline :)",neutral
"Wants me to write a username, but says ""username already taken"", even when I put nonsense in.",neutral
i dont get the point of the game,neutral
"Clunky, annoying lag time after button presses, often won't update upon opening",neutral
timezone feature broken. the gamification was a little too complicated and too much for my needs.,neutral
Im giving it 3 stars. it deserves 5 stars for the app but getting 3 cause after i bought some Gems there were some shady withdrawals which means the privacy protection for my card was breached... and im 99% sure its from Habitica cause this happened right after the purchase. please increase your cyber security for card transactions.,neutral
"I love Habitica so far, with the exception that no one is able to get my party invitations! It would also be great if party members could trade pets.",good
"The graphics are adorable, and the UI is clean. There were a few things that were a little confusing to find, but there's a wiki that answers a lot of questions as well as the FAQ. The only reason it doesn't work for me is because tasks feel more like currency than progression. Other task rpg apps either chart your progress or show it as a literal path, which feels more like moving forward. Cute app, but more for those who like armor building in MMOs.",good
"It works, but it has issues... the thing is, compared to some other apps of it's kind, its not great. It could use some more customization, like custom items, and the tutorial is kinda annoying, especially with pre made tasks. But, it does what it says and well enough Edit: Thanks to the Habitica team for responding, some developers don't care, but it's good to know this app has a great community!",good
Please add the option to view progress monthly / year / week,good
Just change the colour of delete/save button in dark theme and I'll recommend this app to everyone I know.,good
Great looks and concept. Has some important features for accountability that other apps don't. Task scheduling not as good as the competition. Tutorial needs to be more explanatory.,good
"Just installed yesterday and have used it for a whole day. The app is very helpful is setting concrete habits to reinforce or discourage and comes in the familiar set up of a video game. I'd definitely recommend this to others who are trying to develop themselves. One minor issue is that in some dark app themes, the delete and save button can't be seen because the text and background have the same color. Other than that, the app works fine.",good
It's fun,good
I would really like it if there was an option to have rewarding sounds when completing checklist items in Dailies and To Do's. Thanks to the amazing team at Habitica. You rock :),good
I love those platform but the recent update is buggy,good
"It's a cool app, but I wished there was a way to know how much you have improved week by week or a similar record. It doesn't really push you to improve, just to do something, if you do less than before, it's ok, you just advance slower and you keep going slow. It would motivate me more to try and do better than the last day or the last week, but I wouldn't know how that was unless I took a screenshot :/",good
Great app and service! The user base is amazing and the staff is awesome. No notification when a challenge ends and no way to automatically remove its associated tasks. Can't read the full text of challenge tasks before joining. Most notifications don't work for me. The redesign looks really nice!,good
"Really good for motivating me to do certain tasks. I do wish that To-Do list items turned red slower as the number of sub-tasks under it increased, but that's just me. Edit: Feedback form isn't there.",good
"I love the new dark mode, I use dark mode for everything so this is much appreciated. The design has been streamlined and it's easy to use. I do check off all my tasks in one go, so the rewards popup blocking the last item on the list is a little annoying but workable. Just gotta wait a second for it to go away.",good
"This is the first of these gamified task/habit trackers I've tried that I liked enough to stick with. A bit buggy, but enjoyable enough to make up for it. Update: The app has a dark mode now, too!",good
"It it great. But, I am using Habit now. I like to know the stats of my habits as that app shows. No hard feelings, only personal preference.",good
It's really good really helpful. Please put a Goal feature,good
I love that's application but l Will to be in spanish version I love that's application but l Will be like to be in spanish version,good
"Super bueno, salvo porque estar en la app diciendo que hiciste y que no te resta tiempo de tareas que debes hacer",good
"Excellenct! Love it! But there is one thing Habitica DESPERATELY needs: A vision / goal setter! Means a function to set a specific goal or describe a vision, and add tasks / to-dos / habits specifially for this goal! It might even be a main tab at the bottom of the menu. Habitica can't just only do repetitive tasks, there ought to be goals too! Please implement this...",good
I really enjoy the app and it helps in keeping up with the goals. Congrats to the team Habitica for this creation. I'm rating it 4 because there are still bugs exists and I'm not satisfied with the idea of 'only team leader can end a quest in order to for someone to leave the party'. I was invited to a party by a friend and then he stopped using it when we grew apart which made me trapped in the party not able to finish a quest. I had to delete my account and restart for keep going. :(,good
Wow! Adhd helper for sure,good
"At fırst it seems complicated, but after some days you will find it handy and usefull. It really organized my day. If I could invite my friends via different social media it would be great. In the mean time inviting them via email is the only choice.",good
"Needs to push its updates more, I didnt know there was an update",good
Pretty buggy but good campion app for the desktop version,good
Great app but has lots of bugs. That's to be expected though for any app and they are doing good work.,good
"I like it but half the time when I press something, nothing happens and it doesn't like it when I've pressed more than 3 things while the app has been open on my phone, it will either freak out sending me somewhere I didn't ask for or it will close itself",good
Really fun and keeps you working on day to day tasks.,good
"Cool app, would be better if it was as functional as the site re: challenges.",good
I do like the app. It's fun and has me coming back after I do something. But I would like to get gems without purchasing a subscription. I'm fine if it's slow but I kinda wish there was a way,good
Would be better if each Habit had a separate reminder time.,good
"Wish there were different ""skins"" for the app beyond fantasy, e.g. sci-fi, horror, real life, etc.",good
Please add archiving for stagnant dailies,good
"Maybe implement something that categorises and levels up specific areas, such as creativity, language, programming, DIY, home, gardening, hygiene, fitness, culinary skills etc. Everything seems to just bundle into general exp.",good
Cool but really confusing,good
"I wish it was offline, like people may not have an internet connection always and it will be a little annoying to see that you can't move forward without internet. Also I can find an option to repeat my to do list . Like in Google task you can set a time for it to remind you what to do and also you can make it repeat. It's sad that a app like this doesn't have such a basic thing.",good
"This is a great app, I really enjoy using it! There are a few minor bugs here and there, but nothing serious that prevents functionality. You can access Guilds to chat with people about various topics and check off everything you need to do in a day with a little helpful motivation from party members. Definitely would recommend this app for those who are motivated for the next level up!",good
Great for getting Organizated. Not sure how the social aspects of quests and guilds work/play into dayily actities.,good
"É um App bem legal para organizar tarefas simples do dia a dia. Ainda estou aprendendo a usar, mas achei bem divertido.",good
Love it but would love it more if I could look into the future to see what I have scheduled easily,good
"I enjoyed using this app for over the past 2 years to improve my life, even if it was by a little bit. The community is kind and friendly. But I think it would be better if you could filter out what type of guild you want to join. I don't want to spend too much time scrolling down just to find the right guild.",good
App is pretty good but everytime I add an item to my to-do list or habits etc it goes back to the party tab. So annoying to go back to tasks every time I add something,good
This app has actually really made a difference in my life. I am so grateful BUT I feel it could be WAY better. Can you add in: A Timer (for workouts) and perhaps Minigames?? (The higher level your character the more powerful stuff like that 😀😀) Thank you devs!,good
"I really like the app but the downside is no offline mode, this will be a better app if it had an offline mode.",good
"It's a great app, and it's fun and intuitive to use! But I do have one concern. Clear notifications button is not working as of the moment.",good
Cute app. Could do with a more user-easy interface for the lazy out there but nice little motivator,good
"This is a fun way to build the keystone habit you need to make all your other daily habits click into place. I think the mechanic of guilds is probably one of the most engaging things about it. My critique is that in order to access the challenges available from the guilds you're in, you have to get on your desktop. This is super annoying because I'd rather only use the mobile app. Fix this and it's an easy five stars.",good
Perfect app but you need to add night mode,good
"Great interface and concept. What I appreciate most that other apps don't do is that they distinguish between habits, dailies, and to do's!! Props. Also I love the guilds concept as well. One suggestion is maybe have a clear visualization tool too see the progress made. But I get it the point of this app is to level up your avatar! Overall good job 👌",good
Love habit forming features! Wishing for more heirarchy in to do lists.,good
Need a combination for habits and dailies,good
"Turning your life into a RPG is a great way to stay motivated. If they can provide something like a monthly habit tracker, it would be great",good
"This app has become my life. I truly love it. It helps me work towards my goals in a very fun&supportive environment. My down points would be (mainly) because of gems. While the game is free, there are certain things you can only get through buying gems. Which is understandable, they need to be able to support themselves&the game. My problem is that while you can earn them for free, it's damn near impossible to compete with 200+ people in one challenge and get rewarded.",good
"I have used Habitica for a year now, and I would suggest this app to anyone who wants to meet people with the same goal of building healthy habits. I have met amazing people, battled in hard quests which driven me to finish my dailies, and joined a variety of challenges! The app still has some glitches here and there, but I mostly use the website.",good
Hi kindly show highest streak for a habbit. Which will act as high score to break the next time and we keep on improving our streaks!!! Sorry i took away a star.,good
"Hey guys great game but I'm a mage and my mana keeps changing itll go to 300 and then ill level up and itll drop back down to 268, its been doing that for a few days please help us :)",good
Good but have more levels,good
it has very very few bugs in the mobile app but i love it!,good
"Love it, keeps me motivated but you should add something to share and make my friends join, like an invite, not the one you share your level up",good
"Great Concept, good community functions but some additional advice/tutorial and examples for planning your day / tasks with this app would be great",good
This app is really cool and can help build many habits and keep track of to do lists. However I would like options to customizer the avatar more? Like I accidentally added glasses and there isn't a option for none. Can you please add it?,good
This app actually made me want to stick to my habits. The money/exp system is kind of broken and arbitrary. Fun way to think about your habits as life skills and the more you do it the better you get at it.,good
I wish there was more interaction with party quests,good
"Great to-do list app with addicting premise, but can't remove glasses customization option once they're on. Please change this! I don't want my avatar to have glasses and can't remove them since the option doesn't appear to let me do so. Will change review to 5 stars once this is fixed",good
"Great app for those who need extra motivation This is just my idea, but why don't add timed to-do (in image of monsters or something) that will reduce the health of the protagonist (or any negative effects) if they did not finish it on time It may as well push the user to work immediately later than procrastinate, I think I got more ideas but will be too long to write here, so... Anyway, nice app, cool app",good
It deserves more than 4.2★. I'd rate it 4.5 for productivity.,good
Neat!,good
"Good base. Needs greater rewards and harsher punishments. Include more visual/audio cues for success and failure. Take notes from other games that make a big show out to clicking a button, which heightens the stimulation the player recieves.",good
Nice,good
"The app is what you make of it. A big imagination will take you far. I wish it had better mobile support though. Many functions require a computer. And it'd be nice to be able to preview all the cosmetic options that cost gems (the cash currency). Without a preview, its almost gambling, especially with hairstyles",good
Amazing app. Really motivating with an online support team. But so long as its online only its hard to depend on it.,good
"I enjoy the app very much and it's helping me kick some bad habits. The only thing I'm not a big fan of is that it often times does not auto refresh after clicking an item or useing food. Other than that, I like the app a lot.",good
Need to register before use,good
"I love this app and all my friends use it and compete against each other. This is a brilliant concept! however the app seems a bit buggy. I was in beta programme and then I was unable to send invites or buy certain items. I thought it's because of beta being unstable so I opted out of beta and reinstalled the app, still didn't fix the issue. I'm the party leader and the group isnset so that only I can start quests, still anyone starts a quest without me knowing and I don't face this on browser.",good
"Pretty good app. However, there's a point where I'm not making much progress unless I have gems. I understand why the gems are there, but as someone who isn't willing to spend money on an app, it makes it a little boring. Overall, great experience and helped with my habit building.",good
"Getting my work done in a motivational way, with friends in a group! :D",good
"Love the concept behind the app!! I feel silly but it still works. I am able to complete most of my tasks. My only suggestion would be: please, let the characters not be pixellated.",good
"I was introduced to this app by a friend, and it definitely didn't disappoint. The task manager is very fun to use and is extremely customizable, and the events and group activities make it even more fun, though the menu navigation could be improved, as well as the rewards for doing tasks, because I don't feel too motivated to do the tasks still",good
The auto populated list of dailies was never-ending and repetitive. Who needs to floss 30 times a day? I died because i didn't take the time to delete each one individually. Honestly when i scrolled down to try to find the end i couldn't find it and felt i was making no progress in deleting the duplicates.,good
"So far I like it, however there are so many items on the lists when you first download it that it gave me anxiety. You can only delete them 1 at a time and it wants confirmation before deleting each one. If the developers see this I suggest only a few items on each list to give as an example instead of the 200+ I found on my lists that all repeated. Although the check here for downloading the app gave a lot of XP.",good
"This is one of the best apps for self improvement available for gamers. The idea, the execution, the design, amazing. My only gripe is that the error messages you get only sorta explain what went wrong and I have not successfully used the stat correction page once. Always error messages. Hopefully these bugs get worked out.",good
"It's cute, but the fact that I cannot view a calendar with my progress kills it for me. I am going to stick to Loop app.",good
Such a thoughtful self-help app. Life saving for ADHD. THANK YOU for the wheelchair option in the icon... the diversity was such a nice surprise. I do wish there were different task layouts to choose from for the front page -- I'm just easily confused I guess! Thank you staff.,good
"Love this app and use it daily! Great for task managing and motivation if you like games and collecting things! :) There are a couple of bugs though, and the app does not support some of the features available in the web version which i find a bit odd. The phone is the best place to keep a to-do list as it's always with you so i dont understand why the app isn't a priority. Im also missing an option to search or filter my inventory. Other than that i really like it.",good
"Great app so far, still not sure about how everyting works...please can you create some warrior monk feature? (like shaolin rope, ecc.) Good job anyway!",good
It's a good app.,good
It really is worth it to download this app. Thank you for designing this wonderful app! Thanks so much,good
"awesome app, love the prize feature. i would give 5 stars if these two issues were solved: 1. app does not notify me about dailies even though i set a reminder for 7:45am; 2. one of my hobbies that can be checked as both positive and negative stays green forever after checking once, does not refresh at night, is that how its supposed to be?",good
It was amazing! I just didn't have the time to set it up all the way.,good
"Habitica is the best productivity app I've used thus far. It lasted me for months. The quests are the most motivating feature, and I was able to take down a couple bosses solo. However, motivation dried up weeks into my first fetch quest because despite being extremely productive, I had no chance of finding even one shard. Unless you're comfortable teaming up with a bunch of strangers to take on quests, there becomes a point when being solo makes the quest motivation feature impossible.",good
"Сам сервис очень крутой, но пожалуйста сделайте более понятный интерфейс для «Habits», пусть они они становятся серыми или изчезают, когда человек отметил свой прогресс за день. Я банально не помню, отмечала я свой прогресс сегодня или ещё нет, а показатель в виде цифры или зелёного/рыжего цвета мне ни о чем не говорит.",good
Great concept! Has me waking up on schedule and doing my tasks so I dont loose life and earn exp! Just one thing. I cant do quests. I got the dust bunnies quest but I have no clue what to do with it. Help?,good
This app is awesome could use better graphics but overall the idea of it is legit af,good
"Great app! I would like more progression content. Resetting levels is easy implementation, but gets stale quickly. Mages do too much damage. But this app had been transformative and amazing. I will consider contributing to development.",good
This is wonderful but I really need to be able to use it offline as well,good
"I couldn't change the language of this software, I tried it again and again, but the language didn't change.",good
"I love this game. It has helped me do much It's a bit of a learning curve. It would be nice if challenges were visible from the app in all of the guilds, and I would also like to see the last day and time that a habit was marked, because the colors don't always change and if you have a lot of habits it gets confusing. Otherwise, this app is brilliantly done and will be getting my monetary support in whatever way I can afford.",good
Good,good
"lol i went to settings, change character value, and got myself 9M coins uwu btw is that cheating...? I mean well its right there",good
"It worked fine for a while, but now every time I click on a task/habit/goal to edit, the app crashes. I can tick off the task and plus on the habit just fine, but I can't edit anything now... Please look into fixing it soon? Edit: thank you, the latest update fixed it all!",good
Great for ADHD,good
"I've tried quite a few rpg-like to-do list apps and I must say this one is the only one that I find genuinely enjoyable, and actually kinda feels like a game. You can tell a lot of effort was put into the aesthetic, everything is very easy to access and is pleasing to the eye. Although I think there should be a way to uncheck to-do's. I keep accidentally clicking on them in the widget and remaking them every time is starting to get annoying.",good
Could be better if it was completely free.,good
"So far so good, you have to be willing to set on the app for a bit to figure it out. It's a rpg game based off of truth. The app does freeze fairly frequently but you just have to close it and reopen it and everything is back in order.",good
"I like this app, and it's really helped, but now I can't open it anymore. It crashes while loading, every time. I've tried troubleshooting, restarting, deleting the cache, but nothing seems to work.",good
"Thank you. I love the app and it's helping me immensely already. The only suggestion I can think of is, I wish there was a way of keeping track of my previously completed tasks so I could look back on the progress I've made. It would feel much more meaningful that way and serve as additional motivation.",good
"There are some things i feel need to be ironed out e.g. i found feeding the pets/mounts a bit buggy, but overall it has definitely helped me think more about my personal goals and how to approach them",good
"It has been an effective motivator and tracker for me to accomplish the smaller tasks that get me closer towards my bigger goals. But there seems to be a Bug - I can't seem to receive a friend's Party invite, though I am able to create my own party and invite friends to it. It's a one way street in my app! Joining guilds and the self-care, self-sabotage info have been most educational and helpful.",good
The ios app is lot better than this. please improve it as soon as possible.,good
Best app for daily Routine but there are some issue such as you can get lot of coins and increase your level to infinit though settings. You should improve that because Some one donot get motivated for doing task when you knew that you can change your level.,good
"I like the app a lot, but some features are a little annoying. I have a few suggestions. - More ways to tweak what the widgets look like (currently they take up a lot of space). - It would be nice to see the completed tasks together with active tasks instead of them disappearing. - Task subcategories! Please! 💚 - Biggest gripe: because of the way the entire list item is like a button, I keep accidentally checking tasks that weren't actually done. +Bugged unchecking. Pls fix. Thanks💚💚💚",good
"I just want to say that the tutorial was too much info, things like this should be explained in a short and concise way, at a good pace. It was just too long and too much to take in. I didn't even try the app though, I can't say what rating it deserves. I am unnistalling but I may come back to it in the future, it's not you, it's me. (Also, you can't delete your account on mobile but you can on desktop. I suggest people to try the desktop version since it may have more features)",good
"It's been a good way to get things done, and the concept of an RPG is very well executed. The reason for 4 out of 5 is simply regarding the interface. My wife uses it on iOS and it is light-years beyond what we have on Android. Much cleaner, more useful information, and less clunkiness.",good
"This app is an awesome (and fun) to-do list! I like it a lot and it helps me out with my life and tasks every day. However, the app crashes whenever I try to sort to-dos by scheduled and it's getting a bit frustrating.",good
Pretty good app that helps me stay organized. Could use a few improvements but overall I enjoy it,good
Habitica is awesome! Only thing that it's hard to feed your pets with the app.,good
"couldn't create my avatar at first, but after that it worked fine.",good
"Great idea and I'm enjoying it so far. Chores and errands are much more fun. My one gripe so far is that it seems like most items/quests cost gems, which are pay to play. I'm afraid i'll pretty quickly run out of free items/quests to strive for and then the app will lose its effectiveness. It'd be helpful if their were other ways to unlock gems outside of paying for them, like reaching extra high levels of productivity/habit building, etc.",good
"So far it's pretty good. I've been using it about a week. Sometimes it doesn't refresh, but the other users on the app seem positive and friendly. There is a lot that I am learning through users that isn't actually explained in the app. Like if you don't do all your daily tasks, the whole party takes damage. So yeah, no pressure! It would be nice for a better help options or a more detailed in-app-fist-time training/learning session. Every 'first' should option for more info!",good
"Really nice app that is easy to use. Would be cool to see a feature where you can build things, like building a village and materials for this are acquired through completing tasks/habits",good
"The app's a bit glitch-y, not gonna lie, but it helps tremendously in my day-to-day life. The community aspect of it is amazing, I actually feel motivated by all the kind words. Good job, developers, my life's a bit less bleak now! c:",good
Its pretty good so far. My dailies just seem to never reset though. I got a streak of 2 and from then on it never moved forward,good
This app is good and it's useful. Yes it's true that it has a few bugs here and there but the app itself is good and I like it. I wish it had an offline mode because I can't stay on all the time but I can see why we need to be online at all times.,good
"This app has really helped me get my stuff in order! It also has an active community and good challenges! It is a bit glitchy at times (things don't refresh, etc) but overall it's great! Edit: lol, the 'report a bug' is glitched on my phone :P I had to manually send my info over, in the middle of fixing a glitch where my day won't reset - been broken for a week.",good
"Not very expressive frame for activity descriptions, must be in the first stages of development. Guilds look incredible diverse, very surprising it is a social app. Seems the leveling function is standard gaming and well embedded. Hope open sourcing it make it better fit. Passing habits to to-do would be desirable.",good
"I'm easily motivated by things like points and streaks, so this app works really well for me to increase my productivity and decrease my anxiety. I use rewards for breaks, and find that I get unpleasant but short tasks done much more often, because I can earn breaks quickly by just getting them over with. I also get my long, complicated, multi-part projects done early. I gave it four stars because there are a couple of features I'd like to see, but it works great as is.",good
"I'm surprised, this app actually works for me! It helped me procrastinate less, but I also realised it works only if I remind myself to check the app a lot. I recommend it for those who have really bad procrastination problems like myself. Even if the game style of this app isn't your thing, it's a great to-do-list app for habits, daily reminders and general to-do items. Only complaint is it's glitchy for me when I want to customise my avatar.",good
"I've been wanting a habit tracker that is fun and this definitely is. There are a few loading issues every so often, if those bugs weren't there I'd give 5 stars. All around though enjoyable, easy to use, and a great way to keep track of good and bad habits.",good
"I really like the concept of this app, the style, the features, and it has done its part in motivating my studies and organizing my life. However, the app needs some serious redesigning. The layout is difficult to navigate and the chat function is almost useless. The way challenges are organized could also use improvement. All in all, I like using it (make an account a month ago), but the functionality needs to be improved",good
"would love, love, LOVE an offline mode as I don't have internet access at all time but adore this app to keep me on top of my life and mental and physical health",good
"Can this please get a feature where I can add tasks when offline and it uploads to the server whenever I connect to the internet. At the moment, it simply deletes everything.",good
"I love this format, only thing that would make it better is some form of active side scrolling gameplay element, build your character throughout the week and then try to beat a level sort of thing",good
"This is a very helpful and fun way to get yourself in the habit of doing things. The Daily Tasks are a fantastic way to get your daily stuff handled and check them off within the app. You've got the ability to create To-Do lists with due dates and notification reminders can make it ridiculously simple to get even the most complex task completed. On top of all this, seeing your character earn experience, new items and getting pets and mounts turns all the monotony into a wickedly AWESOME RPG.",good
"A great idea, and the app itself has been improved a fair bit, but still a little bit too slow to respond to give five stars. Seems a bit like server congestion maybe?",good
Very cool app!,good
"I've been using this app for about a year now, I think. I love keeping myself accountable, and tracking what I'm doing and what I'm not each day. Lately, I've been getting push notifications for every single message that members of my party are sending in chat, none of which mention me. I've switched off push notifications completely but they're still coming through all the time. This is the only thing stopping me from giving 5 stars!",good
The app is good and all. The only problem is that the reminder does not work.,good
"Fun for university students The only problem is they don't order the tasks by date, do you have to be careful not to miss homework. Now that i think about it, it's actually a big problem for students using the app. It is fun, overall, and I do homework to keep my avatars alive. Think Tamagotchi",good
So far I love it,good
"Amazing app. Some glitchy moments, but overall nothing too annoying. This app is so cool that I'm OK with some glitches because in a very short time its already brought so much value to my life! Brilliant idea to get you into good habits and out of bad ones. In my experience it actually works!",good
Fabulous tool for task management by those organizationally challenged. For five stars it would need to include a calendar function.,good
"Have been looking for a way to incorporate the elements of gaming into making progress ""In Real Life"". Even tried inventing something for myself but paper tracking was a nightmare and having it in this app is just fantastic! Really like it and it has made a big difference! The only reason I took it down a star is because it depletes my phone battery really fast if I am in the app for very long, such as when I am shopping or browsing challenges, so I do these things mostly on my PC. Overall, great job! Would recommend this to anyone that enjoys gaming but is struggling with motivation in the real world.",good
I wish I could control the reminders for my tasks more. Like the volume or what noise it makes. Other that that the app is great for keeping track of things that need to be done.,good
"Every other month, I think I'll do better. I try again. I download this app. Everything gets back in order, so I uninstall it to free up space in my storage. Then I relapse. I download the app again. This is a never ending cycle of desperation, loss, and hope. I will always download this app. I will always uninstall it. 9/10 would recommend",good
"Разработчик исправил ошибку, которая не давала начать и оказалось, что приложение довольно хорошее, но:Режим испытания - бред. Кто-то его использует по фану и исход решает рандом. Кто-то пиарит свой ютуб канал.Так же, нет приоритизации сложности целей.Т.е кто -то поставит сложной целью написать диплом, а кто -то сходить в магазин.Дорого,в игровой валюте, стоят квесты. За неделю так и не получил. Хотя целей было много. Удалил его, так как мне не подходит дизайн для офиса. Но это уже особенность",good
"I have been using Habitica for quite some time now and i must say, it has been the most useful in helping me establish a structure to my day. HOWEVER, the To-Dos are very limited in its functions. It's hard to implement a full task management (such as GTD methodology). It pretty much only supports next action steps, not any layers such as Projects or Waiting For. Also, syncing across devices can sometimes be problematic I hope they will improve the To-Dos and make syncing smoother.",good
Such a cool app! I'm in love with it! Sad that it doesn't work properly offline though :( also has bugs,good
Quite good,good
"It's a great start to improving your life, but it's more or less just a planner app!",good
Amazing app but the extremely buggy ui have made the app irritating to use and sometime unusable without a restart.,good
"I like it a lot. But it doesn't have as much of the GAME aspect to it. I wish there was a feature where you character could actually play in an rpg game using the equipment and skills you earned. You could have a little rpg game on the side and has cute little morality stories. Without it, it doesn't really incentivize much.",good
"It's amazing, I just wish there was goals and categories for tasks",good
"A great app for tracking goals and habits. It is also the most fun since you achieve virtual goals ""XP and Gold"" to level up your character! Will give 5/5 if it had a Dark Theme!",good
Quite confusing,good
Nice but why does it need data tho?,good
its ok little confusing at first i think some more of the features that are in the add a blah should be a bit more clear. also a report a bug option would be nice my entire phone is on silent cause im at work app still makes sounds.,good
This app can save your life. Love how you can pin widgets to your home screen on Android phones. Only suggestion is to add a calendar.,good
Great way to manage your tasks. Only downside is you set the deadlines and can knowingly chance them at any time,good
"INCREDIBLE for keeping motivation up, but the mobile app is intermittently buggy in odd ways. Definitely still highly recommend it, though!",good
Great app!,good
The concept is absolutely amaizing😊 but the procedures are very complex...😅 Can you plaese make another app with same concept👍 and with simple procedures...😊 [In simple words... Please make a simple app which has concept of gaming type rewards on completing important tasks...🤗],good
"Perfect app!.... but its missing an IMPORTANT tab... its already got Habits, Dailies and To-Do's BUT it doesn't have a Bucket List/Life Goals tab, for me, It doesn't feel right to put ""Learn a new recipe"" in the To-do Tab, I also want to put in my goals like ""focus on getting high grades"" or ""get a girlfriend"", I can't put these in other tabs",good
Buggy but awesome!,good
would be perfect if I could organize the to-do's by date!! they're random right now,good
"Very Nwice Hi, How can I sort my todos according to due date? Is there any way I can team up with local players? Also is any offline version coming up, just to check off tasks? Thanks.",good
"I used this all the time before, and it was fun in the beginning, but got really tired of the low res graphics! If they were a bit more high def, it would be amazing! we could finally see the equipment customization better - more motivating to continue using and complete tasks.",good
I'll give it a 5/5 once yall make it functional offline 😛 (like maybe allow us to edit/cross off tasks offline and let it automatically sync once connected to the internet),good
"Good app with good widgets one star deducted as I can't work out how to view completed tasks, dailies and habits",good
"I guess I love it as it kind of works? I mean this is as good as an app can get for it's purpose. It has the perfect amount of features and completely customizable. The biggest problem I have is at the beginning it's very challenging to keep alive (as you have no party/armour yet) and also as far as I'm aware I could only edit the order of the dailies, I wish they can be done to other sectors too.",good
Great app. I just wish there was a way to keep track of time on a task/habbit (built-in timer instead of having to open an external timer),good
"This app has been so helpful for me to be more productive, as i didnt take care kf myself before! i can't complain about anything, except sometimes when i first log in for the day, my dailies will be from yesterday and will take a minute to switch to today. I would love to see why so-and-so points are being deducted when you take damage from missed dailies! Like.... ""Clean (medium): -6 Health"" or something like that. I don't think I'll ever delete this app, and i look forward to any updates!",good
"it is fun. every time i get an egg/food/potion though, i have to drag down the spinning wheel to let it reload 😒",good
"The app version has so much more to improve. Aside from being buggy, a lot of features are still missing compared tovthe web version. Four stars because it helps me nonetheless. I wish the team best of luck and thank you for Habitica! ✨",good
"just started using and seems interesting, hope it'll help me to improve my life! one issue I have is that it does not give an option to sort to-do task by deadlines, which is better to see which tasks are urgent and not overlooked, hope there's an update to add this function!",good
"rlly good,just 4 for bugs.. but it's really good!!",good
"i cannot pin/unpin rewards after UI updated, plz fix it. i love this game😭",good
"with the new update, when you tap tasks or the eggs and hatching potions you have to close and reopen the app in order to get it to load. but otherwise the update is really cool",good
"App doesnt work without internet connection, everything else is great",good
"Excellent app, great habit tracker. I've found in this app an exciting way to be productive! There are some bugs and functionalities that need to be fixed, however, it's worth using it. I really recommend it.",good
to do list and reward system works for me when regular lists don't cut it. Chat in the app has a bug that keeps you from seeing what you are typing.,good
"Easiest way for me to use Habitica. Simple but motivating. I'm not sure if moving the plus button to the center was a good idea, it covers more of the text of the tasks there. Though it is a easy to forget that you need to pull down on the tasks section to see any changes in inventory/tables.",good
very help..,good
"Oh my goodness. I'm so sorry if I pressured you guys. I actually just listened to Thomas Frank's podcast with you guys from a few years ago and learned more about HabitRPG's history and its developers. I love how responsive you guys are unlike some other app developers. They didn't send me any feedback on an issue, neither did they try resolve it. Anyways, I'll just leave a 4-star so that you guys could be motivated to get a 5-star! Love your work! Shout out from the Ph.",good
"Make it easier to understand when you're activating quests. I didn't have anyone in my party by I was still somehow doing it and finished it by myself without realizing it. Make a design change/renaming so that there's something labeled ""start quest"". Still a fun and useful app. Growth is neverending",good
I am a big gamer and always found my self more motivated by games. thank you for making my life action list more fun and rewarding.,good
"Just downloaded the app.Loving the idea of adding my own habits & to do stuff which i used to tick off daily on notepad(uff) ,now I am glad its automated with rewards too!!.(yay!)Have a suggestion to make all sections of list tabs movable up/down (like the rewards section) to organise as per customisable preference.(-:)",good
"love the idea! but the execution is kind of clumsy. there's little to no guidance with regard to how parties or challenges work, and the rewards seem to be random at best. the graphics are adorable and the app definitely has potential though! but it would be more user friendly to streamline the app because it can be overwhelming with so many choices and options (i.e. mounts, food, eggs, etc) that seem mostly arbitrary.",good
Wonderful app.,good
"The app is great, but is it possible to see the tasks from your Group?",good
"How can I set it so that a task would show ""the remaining days until its due"" (like on the PC), rather than showing ""the date it's due""? I find the countdown of remaining days to be more useful than the date.",good
"Really enjoy the app, probably wouldnt recommend unless you have someone to do it with. Also, please set up a system of 'weekly' tasks, currently you can only set a daily that you complete once a week but it would be nice to have the flexibility of doing a task any day that week without being penalised.",good
"Great app, still getting in to and it looks like there is some content that is only accessible by paying real money but I really love the old school art style.",good
"I would have reported this as a bug within the app, but I found another bug when trying to do that. First one: when submitting a bug or feedback, it does not pass through the 'To' address into the email, so I'm not sure where to send it to. Second one: when editing a habit, daily or to-do text field, the keyboard pops up and disappears. A workaround on this (for my device) is to rotate the phone landscape. Using pixel 3. Otherwise, a very good app!",good
it really helps,good
widgets have disappeared?,good
"Guys - I really want to like this app more and give it 5 stars! Everything is there and I can see the work and effort that has gone into making it so thank you so much! But on Android the habits screen is quite buggy and won't let me adjust the streaks. The keyboard comes up but closes immediately so I can't do anything. The dailies work fine. I look forward to any updates you're planning but considering this is free, I think what you've achieved is great!",good
"We are using this as a group in my family and it honestly is helping us a lot with staying motivated. I have a difficult time with my anxiety and depression, but this app has helped me to feel a sense of accomplishment. I am experiencing inspiration a little more often and I have been struggling for years with this. There are some aspects I'm not entirely fond of that I hope will continue to be updated; however I'm grateful to the developers for making and keeping up with this!",good
"Great motivator, especially with the whole online and boss battle aspect. Far too pay to play, however.",good
I never enjoyed doing my todo list as much as this before! There are some bugs though...,good
Amazing App!!! But still you guys need make a lot of changes in UI for eg: I am unable to decide how much coins should i get with one positive And all task should reset at a specified time by user,good
Fantastic Habit Forming App! The staff is so kind and helpful. My reading skill and general cleanliness are castle improved. I love forming a party with friends and doing all the little quests together.,good
Great experience. This app has made me more productive and engaged! Love it,good
"I find it so hard fitting things in/remembering to do things, but this app makes it a breeze. Grateful to have it! 👏",good
Made productivity really fun.,good
Best gamification app.,good
awesome!,good
"Makes daily chores feel like a game. Habitica has this thing where you collect an extensive list of gears and animal companion when you complete tasks. I love collecting items, so choosing the rogue class out of the other 3 is probably the best choice for me. There's so much more to it too :)",good
I REALLY LOVE THIS APP. REALLY MULTIFUNCTION AND REALLY GOOD!!,good
Nice app tp start a new habit!,good
"Great idea, great app",good
Worked extremely well for me with getting organized and gamifying everyday tasks. Has a really helpful community.,good
Previous issue was fixed by developers. Thanks for getting back in a timely manner. Great application and is a fun way to keep yourself motivated. Being a gamer myself it is a nice change of pace to your traditional tracking app.,good
"Great app help helps me get stuff done compared to other so-called ""Adult"" "" serious, not childish"" app",good
"New UI design is amazing! Only one mistake... when I edit a task, the save button is not showing but I can click that...look into it. Edit: Its fixed now already, Thank you :)",good
"I love it :D I met great and fun people and this is the only to-do apps that really makes me do it or else I'll die oof. I love the concept and all but i kinda wish that there'll be more default costumes like the hair that is free, or some that can be bought by coins if possible. And maybe the background too? Anyways overall I love it, it was really effective for me. Keep up the good work, I'll look forward on it",good
"What would I do without this? Seriously. I don't know. This has honestly helped me work out, and floss. How dumb is that? I don't want to disappoint my party, so I have a certain amount of reps and chores to take care of every day. And darn it, I do them. I have 100% seen improvement in my muscle-mass. It seems... So weird. But this game/whatever you want to call it has started to make me buffer. And I love it.",good
"Best app I've used to help me stick with habits. They change colors, ranging from deep red to light blue, to show the how well you are doing with the habit. The support features and articles help you customize the app in many ways to fit your needs.",good
"This app is amazing! It's exactly what I need to keep track of my goals, cleaning tasks, and to-dos. The widgets were a game changer and allowed me to basically create my perfect bullet journal spread on my phone. And they already gameified it for me so I don't have to. Truly a blessing of an app.",good
"Habitica has been a massive positive push in my life. I dont make alot of game reviews, but i kinda felt like i had to for this one. I have adhd and it mainly affects my executive function which gives me alot of issues with procrastinating and putting things off and letting things like my personal hygiene and im ashamed to admit this, but the care for my animals go. Having a place to manage all that with an immediate repercussion, even if digital has been a wonderful motivator",good
"This app has helped my family and I maintain a daily routine despite the emotional rollercoaster that has been 2020. Updates sometimes cause bugs but they're rather charming & are quickly corrected. Whether you're using this solo, with irl friends, or ones you make through the app, habitica will help!",good
I wish it will be widget in next update Please,good
"Used to love this app, but recently, it's become very buggy. I can no longer use the check boxes for Dailies or To-Do's. Please fix this app. UPDATE: Appears that whatever bug occurred has been fixed.",good
I love this app! The new dark mode is great. You guys fix any problems really fast and listen to the people who use Habitica which I appreciate. Cheers!,good
"One of the most flexible productivity apps I have used. Works as a Habit tracker, daily reminder list, and a To-Do list, which is great if you want to have an overview of all these things inside a single app. Makes your tasks feel less overwhelming by keeping the theme light and fun. The devs add new content to it constantly and the community is able to create guilds and challenges, offering a more social experience than most other productivity apps.",good
"It's a nice to do list app for me. Separating things into habits, dailies, and to do's isn't something I really thought about. So it's helped me plan what I want a bit better. I just wish there was a late night mode where it acts as if it's yesterday so you can accurately reminesce about what you did that day. I usually plan things out at night. Also turning a to do into a nice grocery list would be nice too. Trying to put it in the notes of a to do doesn't really work since you can't check.",good
"Useful, needs a good internet connection (I can do banking and then find that my connection is not good enough for Habitica). I have used this for well over two years and, even at work, it's a nice boost to my feeling of accomplishment when I get things done. Great co-op with family, too. Very responsive Devs.",good
The best habit and to do list tracking app.,good
Increible! La mejor app para organizar tu vida!,good
This app saved my life,good
This makes me so much more productive!,good
This app changed my life,good
"I noticed how obsessive I was about getting an achievement in some video game..Like a new gun, module etc. I would grind for ages... I thought what if I did this kind of work in real life? I would be so far ahead! So I thought to look for a Gamification app. Habiticia fit perfectly. I'm using the same ""obsessed"" attitude and all my thousands of hours of childhood ""training"" I have to achieve in video games games for achieving my daily habits. Thank you, you saved me. Instant 1 year sub.",good
This is one of the best to do lists that I have used . Even Google's to do lists pales on comparison.I was surprised to find no constant ads or a pro mode which these things usually have. The widgets are almost perfect except for the hobbies make that 1x1 but it's a really good experience overall . I recommend using it . It helps a lot gamifying ur to do list makes you more eager to do them . Thank you for a to do list that is totally free . I definitely recommend this.,good
Quite fun. Actually started keeping up with good habits already just to hatch some pets,good
Idk why I still stop doing my habits,good
Phenomenal productivity application.,good
One of the few apps i can truly say that is life changing,good
"This app is amazing, truly. Sure, there are still minor bugs that existed from years ago when I started my first account, but the amount of progress it went through during that time period just shows how much the developers care and how much effort they've put (even just from the display!) in towards realizing this wonderful app for all of us who are looking to better our lives. Thank you so much!",good
"I absolutely love this app, it has helped me a lot organizing my time and creating positive habits!",good
"Edit: the app gets better with every update and I hadn't had any bugs for a while now. I absolutely love how it looks after the latest update - super clean and fresh. 5 stars and many thanks to the hardworking devs. Love habitica. I find the app often has one bug or another from update to update, so can't really give 5 stars, but the devs do a smashing job regardless so 4 stars from me.",good
Awesome stuff! I just wonder if its possible to have a choice for dates to be sorted from day/month/year since thats what im used to. Other than that great job!,good
"Thank you for the wonderful update. Been using the app for years. Because of the great update, I bought gems as gratitude to the developers. Thanks!",good
Wow new app ui is looking great,good
"Thank You for the Update, I have been waiting for dark mode since months. Best App Ever!!",good
"This app is really amazing! There are different categories to sort your tasks into to suit your particular needs. The RPG aspect is really well done: your productivity reflects on your avatar in a surprisingly immersive way. It's rich with a variety of items, equipment and cosmetic customisations for your avatar; the quest feature is a great way for people to socialise productively and hold each other accountable in a fun and creative way. I've never loved getting things done more!",good
"Love the new UI. Before, you can't look at tasks when offline. It's fixed now. You can also filter the tags.",good
Really helped with motivation,good
This app has been a game changer for productivity in my life. There is soooo much to do and explore.,good
"Amazing app, love it!",good
"I like this app. But currently there's a glitch which isn't letting me delete dailies and habits left over from older challenges which have been closed now. Please look into this. I tried re - installing, and using the website version, but nothing worked.",good
"Can't recommend it enough. Get a party, and you'll make friends super fast and get loooooads of motivation! NO ADS. No annoying popups. Only teamwork, motivation, and rpg magic. Perfect app. Can't thank it enough.",good
"This app helped me so much with acquiring and maintaining good habits! It's amazing, I adore it deeply, and will continue to support it 💛 I've bought a yearly subscription - totally worth it! This app is lovely, and developers deserve all of the praise they can get 💜💜💜 Love you guys, keep up an outstanding work!",good
The best way to help a nerd getting h*s tasks done! I use it everyday.,good
"Habitica isn't just helping me stay productive and organized, it's also really fun to use, and makes me want to do stuff I'd otherwise try to avoid. I love everything about the app, especially the social features like Guilds and Partys which make the whole experience even better.",good
Like it. It has items and you become a character that takes dmg and lvl up. Even got a pet. Love it,good
"I'm only a few days in, but I gotta say, this feels like virtual adderall. I'm excited to get things done now. My to-do list doesn't scare me anymore and I no longer deal with crippling anxiety about all the stuff I didn't do every night when I try to sleep. Definitely feels like I've ""hacked"" my reward system. Fingers crossed this isn't just a honeymoon period, because for the first time in ages I'm ENJOYING getting things done. No more stress - just dopamine.",good
Nice app finally some good frikin friends,good
Excelente para organização pessoal e ainda se diverte com o jogo,good
This app has already helped me so much and I got it a week ago!!,good
Great app that helps me keep organized and motivated. Fun spin on a to-do list!,good
Simplify your life with the leveling up system and - categorizing & organizations,good
"This is a very unique and interesting game, and it's really been helping me keep schedule during quarantine, which is amazing and really makes me happy, but it only gets four stars because sometimes it doesn't keep content. I used a royal purple hatching potion on one of my tiger eggs (I had two) and both items disappeared from my inventory but I didn't get my tiger, which is really disheartening. Very willing to fix this review if it suddenly shows up, but I don't think it will :[edit-fixed!!",good
nice app,good
Great app! Has kept me on track with my goals!,good
"The grindy gamer in me refuses to not be rich in coins buy in order to get coins, I need to finish tasks. I dont even feel like studying is studying anymore. Studying has become grinding for a game, making me want to do it more.",good
Awesome! The last time I used this app was about 3 years ago. Now I use it again and found the updates are amazing.,good
"The best habit forming tool ever, whether you pay any attention to the game aspect or not",good
"This app is great! I've only had it for a few days, and I'm addicted! It's so fun and helps to get rid of habits and create new ones, it helps me get things done. It's so cool! I love the fact that if you want something, you've got to earn it, and it makes you feel good about completing tasks! It doesn't always tell you to rate the app and/or share it which is another plus. 11/10, I do recommend!",good
"I love this app, it only app that keeps my interested. I love the to do list, habits and daily :) then if you want you have a change to challenge yourself. I wish they had a search bar to search up challenge, maybe a group and create group button and way to invite friends and become friends with your real friends so you can do challenges together but I would totally reccomend this app download it now you will not regret it :)",good
Best habit tracker app ever,good
"This app changed my life. Im more willing to do the hard parts of my day because I don't want to take more damage. Seriously, this app is a God send and I even subscribed!!",good
"I LOVE THIS APP VERY MUCH. When the quarantine started, I gained a few kilos, didn't exercise enough and would sit on my phone all day. When I found this app, I started to do things - even making habits that I want to have. Also, this app is also a semi-RPG game, so it's a really big plus. 5 stars, GUARANTEED.",good
This app combines all the features I've been looking for into one simple interface,good
I love this app as it actually help me to change habits.,good
Dame great app,good
"I am completely in love with this app. This app has changed my life completely. Which is why I want it to get even better. Here is a small recommendation. Make a 4 week calender system (A/B/C/D week) so that if you want to make a schedule where you take 1 day off after 3 days of work, It is completely possible to make a routine that will keep repeating itself. (4dayx7=4x7day) by simple math, once you get to 5th week, you are back to the same pattern as that of 1st week and so, the cycle goes on",good
Best productivity app ever.,good
This is a really fun and awesome why to help you sort your life with the bonus of dopmine fun things.,good
So far this seems super cool! I'm excited to try it more and leave a more informed review!,good
trying to be productive,good
"Just love this app,it's really awesome for managing your dailies and to-dos,for anyone who loves gamified version of work to be done this app is all yours ;)",good
Update made it working again... Hats off to the hard working Devs... Eager to try it....!!!👍,good
I love this so much,good
Love it! Such a brilliant idea and really well executed. One of the best apps I've ever used.,good
"One of the best apps that I've used so far... I'm a procrastinator, due to which my grades had suffered a lot... I came across this app on a site, and decided to give it a try... One of my best decisions",good
"I really really love this app. The gamifying is really good. And I especially love the guilds with various creative monthly challenges. Another pro is that most people don't spend too much time chatting. The chatting is limited to a healthy amount (cuz ppl r busy with tasks) and it is still social enough to provide enough encouragement, sharing of thoughts and pointless banter to take ur mind off stressful stuff .",good
This app has helped me in doing my tasks on time. It helps me to be more accountable and be more responsible enough. The gamified style kept me going as I see how much my character levels up.,good
Just like Solo Leveling,good
Best productivity app I've used!!!,good
"Excellent app!!! I would rate it 6/5 if calendar option somehow exist. Imagine you do have birds-eye view in days, weeks or even years. May not be a rating/review more kinda suggestions hehe. Admins and Developers great job! Salute to them for making this app awesome. :)",good
Great tool to develop new habits. I owe habitica a lot.,good
excellent app,good
By far the coolest darn app I have ever played in my life!! I love the whole concept of what is trying to be portrayed here. I doubt I'd actually be good at it because I kind of procrastinate on things a lot😂but it sure is fun already so maybe I've got a chance. But thank you developers for creating this. This can really help people towards their future😊🙏in the most bizarre but absolutely amazing and fun way🤗,good
Keeps me focused,good
"Love it. Pretty simple, and it helps me get things done, and even helped to break bad habits like sleeping wayyy too late and waking up at like 12PM. I haven't talked to other users all that much but from reading tavern messages, the community seems very helpful and supportive. I've been using Habitica for about a year now, and I plan to continue using it until I can finally get things done without having to be threatened by a party quest boss lol. 11/10",good
Very nice productivity rpg game,good
"This is the best! This inspired me to complete my tasks that I always seem to forget in doing. I also had fun at the same time! I really love the RPG-style theme. While using this I realized almost all rpg mechanism are in this but trading so I hope you guys put a trading system or item gifting or whatsoever in the next updates. Also, I wanna try becoming a subscriber for free so, hope you guys give me atleast a 1 mo trial hehe💖.",good
"I LOVE THIS APP. It helps me so much when I want to get something done, and when I need to do something daily, like take my vitamins, or wash the dishes. There are also so much nice people when you join guilds. 10/10 would recommend to a friend. Note: This app is way more helpful if you're into games, points, and competitiveness. (I'm very competitive 😅) But it's still super helpful even if you're not that interested in that stuff. Again, 10/10 would definitely recommend!",good
Actually for once in my life am getting stuff done lol,good
Awesome! I've become way more organized after starting to use this app. Absolutely loved it. Keep up the hard work dev.,good
It just works.,good
"Helped me get in control of my habits, helps me keep accountable! The setup allows me to select how difficult any task is and scales to it, very helpful",good
"I've only just started up, but this app has progressed so much since I last saw it! UI is really tidy and easy to use. It doesn't feel like everything is locked behind a paywall (though I plan to support). Tasks/rewards/etc. are easy to customize, so the game can be tailored to exactly what you need. I have ADHD, so an app that makes every task a fun/novel experience is fantastic. I'm hoping this becomes a well worn tool in my belt. Thanks to the devs for creating such a useful resource ❤",good
"Even without an RPG element, this app is robust enough to suit any of your habit tracking needs. Its ridiculous how much better this app is compared to other regular paid or unpaid habit trackers.",good
Really love this. I enjoy the complexity and the fact that you can buy 'rewards' for keeping up with stuff and that there and consequences for not doing your dailies.,good
"This app really changed my life. I was able to make my life work with this. I've been trying to get my life on track and out of depression, and this app showed me how. Now I am keeping my house clean, keeping up with my social life, doing homeschool with my kids, and keeping up with then 😊 I didn't think that was possible last year.",good
Its awesome,good
"Helps me SO much. Like seriously, commit to this, get into a ""party"" (kind of an online group for this rpg), and it may help you like it's helped me! I am really lazy so the progress I'm making is miraculous. It really kind of.. forces you to do what you need to do and it's my favorite mobile game there is. Hats off to the developers and anyone else involved!",good
"Amazing, creative and motivating. Kudos Designers love the Gameboy pixellated feel really made me nostalgic. Amazing app",good
"This app is very nice, it did help me",good
"Took me awhile to figure it out, the mechanics are interesting, the design is fun. It helps me build and quit some habits that i have been trying to.",good
Fun,good
"I've been using this as a motivation and self-rewarding To-Do list. It works, and there a lot of communities of people here! Ranging from LGBT to mental illness, it's great.",good
It just might be one of the best apps ever made. It has helped so much with my productivity and has such wonderful features. I love it!,good
I will reinstall this app,good
The app is really smart,good
Helps me turn my crippling depression into regular depression.,good
Thanks for free widget,good
I'm thoroughly enjoying this app so far. I've been a lot more productive and on point with my tasks as well as keeping up with my personal studies and hobbies. The game aspect has been great for me to hold accountability of my actions while finding joy in completing self-made goals and gaining experience and items.,good
Super fun way to keep up with tasks,good
It was amazing,good
"Great. I would recommend the following features: - Skills. When you work on a task, you could select which skills you will be working on. - A timer: keep track of how long you spent working on a task, and consequently on the skills. This would allow a summary of how long the player spent on each skill. - (maybe?) Skill trees. Being able to create publix skill trees for a project/hobby/etc... would be a very nice feature too.",good
"Very good app to help keep and develope new habits! Best gamification of tasks, habits and to do lists!",good
"It's hard to not get bored when I being serious on something. So, I always think that life is a game. And this is a great app that can help me to get rid from my boredom when I build my good habits. Thank you very much for the developer. 5 stars from me. 😊🤩",good
"Love the app so far. Great for motivation, but non-punishing, cute graphics, and lots of stuff to explore. Splitting up tasks by priority/type is awesome. It really has made everyday life feel more guided and fun! Would highly recommend for people who enjoy collecting, gaming, or seeing your progress add up. *One note is that sometimes, lists of tasks disappear/show tasks already completed. Closing and reopening fixes it, but would appreciate it if this bug was addressed.",good
Best productivity app,good
"The game aspect is fun, and can provide a little added motivation, but beyond that it's one of the best free to-do apps I've found. The organization is easy, and the breakdown of habits, daily (or other schedule) tasks on repeat, and a one time to-do list give much more depth than apps that claim to be more ""professional."" If you like the game-ify idea this app is great. If you want a solid, free task manager, ignore the cute icons and go with this one as well.",good
Very creative. and a good idea too!,good
Very usefull and fun,good
La actualicé hoy (22/07/2020) y se detiene cada vez que intento ver o darle de comer a mis mascotas. Por favor soluciónenlo 🙇,good
I'm here for the Ninja Cerebral,good
"Loving the app so far and has helped me stay on track with some chores and. My v small complaint is that the date is expressed wrong (for 90% of the world) as mm/dd/yy, wish I could change to dd/mm/yy, any way to change that setting on the horizon?",good
"The BEST app for motivation and tracking! Even putting the game aspect aside, I have never seen a more user-friendly app for habit/task tracking. I love how there are different categories for habits, tasks, and daily to-dos. It's customizable. Getting coins is motivation! Ive recommended it to everyone! Only thing I wish it had: a way to see your stats based on your missed to dos or frequency of habits. For instance: most health lost due to *blank* etc.",good
"It's been a week since I started using this, and I so already love this! Thanks!",good
Habitica is a lot of fun to use. It helps me more to be productive by applying RPG concept into my everyday tasks. The quests and collectibles are also fun to do - it is so rewarding.,good
"Habitica had helped me a lot in my efforts to improve my life. I've been using Habitica for 2 years now, and it really provide me with the motivation & support needed for me to achieve my objectives.",good
This is an awesome app idea for really anyone to use. Just a great app,good
Awesome app. Helps me keep track of my daily tasks and routine. I like the fun reward and punishment system in the form of an rpg game. Keep up the good work!,good
Great way to keep track of things to do on the computer and phone,good
"I didn't think this would work, but it really does help to build habits. The interface is pretty simple and easy to understand. The complexity grows over time. I'd really like a way to share to-dos with a group. Reward those for taking the initiative to take some of the teams shared tasks.",good
Super great!!,good
I seriously like it,good
Thank you this made a difference,good
"One of the best habit organisation apps and it gamifies on top, the only feature that I would really need is managing dailies in groups, like meals in group.....etc.",good
"What an adorable and inspirational app! I have actually done things I was considering putting off because I didn't want to lose too much life and thus important items I really need/like. I've even gotten my partner to download it! It also doesn't penalize you too harshly for ""falling off the wagon,"" so to speak, and not using it for some time. As in, days to YEARS. It's the perfect combination of motivational and understanding, which is the perfect recipe for success, at least for myself. 🤓",good
Really helps me to keep things organized and is a great way to keep myself on track!,good
Its great but I need to make a habit to use the app.,good
Just love it,good
"Does what it says, but unable to re-arrange the tasks to my liking via the app. Have to use the browser to do that.",good
Excellent for daily tasks and scheduling future ones,good
Life changing app. If you have any affinity to video games and want to better your life you're in the right place. This app saved me.,good
"Excellent app, they greatly improved the quality since last time I used it. I'm a user of the web page for 5 year now, and the app was a little outdated but know it is very complete and useful. Thank you!",good
"It sounds crazy but this app has basically changed my life. I'm more productive every day as this game motivates me to get my life together. I like how I can give myself credit even for the little things, the house chores no one will pay you to do or thank you for but that still need to be done. It can also be very social if you want it to be.",good
Amazing app.. One request from the developers.. This app is turning humans into better humans so 'the rouge' class should be renamed to 'the Ninja' or something as it affects the subconscious brain of users without even them noticing it..(this pure psychology) And this is how low of attraction works.. Never talk or think of things which you don't want in life.. You yourself would not want anyone to be Rouge. So please give 'ROUGE' SOME positive polish.. If you can. Only a humble suggestion.,good
"I have used this tool continuously since 2015 and it's a fun way to get yourself to do tasks that otherwise you might not be motivated to do. I've been a subscriber for almost two years. I would highly recommend Habitica, whether you prefer to do it all on your own, quest with others, take up challenges, or just keep track of your flossing. There's a lot to out and I've never gotten bored in almost five years.",good
Awesome. It really helps me to level up my life.,good
"Changed my life. The group feature, when you have a family, is a must have. Seeing our avatars morph and change while we level up our life, priceless. This app is worth it, it's one of the best decisions I've made for me and my children. They're excited to do chores, and I no longer procrastinate. I just can't recommend this app enough.",good
A good app. Love the concept. Helped me,good
This is the first time I found an app which can read my mind. This app really knows the scientific importance of reward. I really advice anyone to install this app and give it a try especially if you are a student.,good
It is awesome super helped me But I have a suggestion you can improve your chat session and to invite members to party you can make so we can explore users and invite them,good
I've never enjoyed accountability before this... Our whole family partied up and is having a blast PLAYING to do chores. Wonderful concept!,good
I'm really enjoying the fun parts about this game and hope that it continues to grow. Downside is the glasses and headband can't come off the avatar. So my character is stuck with them for awhile.,good
Super helpful for habits and breaking bad ones,good
"What an absolute boon. My boyfriend has ADHD and a love for video games--this app helps him remember and complete tasks much more easily than unengaging notes-app checklists. It really does wonders for motivation. Habitica is helping me survive grad school AND manage the mental load of day to day activities. I'm really excited for the new ""groups"" feature to be rolled out as well. Thank you so much Habitica!",good
Loving the app so far! Just a minor note: I can't seem to unequip my avatar's glasses or headband...,good
Awesome,good
This is great! After having played it for three days I was begging my mom for chores to do!,good
"Getting into it, following the mechanics and I feel motivated to do ans comolete stuff to earn Exp. I haven't used it much but I'm satisfied already. One small thing I can't choose to wear no glasses and I believe this is an unintentional error.",good
10 out 10 recommend for anyone who wants to stay organized and goal oriented without knowing you're doing it! This app is For beginners looking for a concept to start planing or motivating & go getters who want a fun and resourceful way to sort your goals and stay motivated.,good
"I love Habitica! I've used it for several years, both the browser version and the app. I love how simple it is and I love the social aspect! I've been able to make friends and find support through guilds, and my party really pushes each other to be our best and continually improve! This app has helped me focus on self care and get better grades in school. I'm building healthy habits and having fun with the creative quests and interactions! Habitica is amazing!",good
Has really helped me get more done and stay on task!,good
The best out there.,good
I love Habitica. It works to make the things I have to do at least somewhat rewarding and I can set fun goals for boring tasks.,good
"Great app. I don't even play video games but I love the set up of this application, the split into habits, dailies and tasks is perfect. The streaks and rewards are motivational, I like the capability to set reminders and being able to have a task list widget on my home page. I tried a couple other to do apps and none have kept me consistent besides this one.",good
"Great! No errors found, super useful, fun, good design, and small (I guess?). Super recommended!",good
"With your friends you can play this game. You progress by completing tasks you set for yourself. Often i see t the app and think, well, 10 pushups isn't that hard, might as well do it. Without the app i wouldn't have thought that. Set small tangible goals. It motivates me to do the things i want to do but can't get in the habit of doing.",good
Fantastic app.... I have tried many other productivity app and used to find it difficult to follow them every day. After I switched to this app.. it became all fun and I am getting motivated to complete the tasks as I earn rewards Suggestion to developer: I use browser version more than mobile app. please add reminder feature to browser version as well. Also please add auto date parser while adding the task. It will save a lot of time in entering the task. You ca take reference from ticktick app,good
"I love the interface, the overall concept and easiness of interface. Rewarding and fun to use, has helped me alot with my life goals!",good
The only app that really helped getting through my really busy schedule,good
Helpful and fun,good
"Love this app. If you need help sticking to a schedule, meeting goals, or want to better your life in any way this app is for you. Guilds and challenges promote productivity. Separate categories for habits (positive/negative), daily tasks, and to-dos keep the app structured. Wish there were more items and rpg aspects after reaching a certain level though.",good
"I love this app. It keeps me on track and I have fun while doing it. Whatever aspect of you daily life you want to improve, you can set tasks and goals to help you achieve it.! 💯🙋🌄",good
Really helped me stay on top of online classes this year!,good
"I love this app. It's helped me so much. There's only a few things that bother me about it, like how you can't change the order of dailies but besides that it's fantastic.",good
The best app for people with or without ADHD,good
"This app is fantastic! It helps to organize tasks and bring new positive habits into your life. And does it in a gamified, entertaining way. You should at least try it out!",good
Thank you,good
Very nice app. Let´s you make reminders and actually feel rewarded once you do it.,good
"The app has improved over the time I've been using it. There are a few things that would be useful to have. For example, the ability to search for challenges like in the website. On another point, this app has really helped me improve in different areas of my life.",good
Love love LOVE the idea behind this!,good
"The best app to become a better person and acheive your daily goals developing great habits! The whole community is cheerful and i may thank you for taking the time to develope such great considerate features for free, you've really helped us all 💖💖",good
"Please keep tinkering, and improving. Thank you for this app",good
"I love this app. It's amazing and has made me a bit more productive with the few days I've had it. I just wish there was some sort of game that comes with it. I know it isn't the point of the app, but I feel like if some sort of game was added, there would be more incentive to do all your tasks. I know it's probably just me who has this issue, but a game really would add a lot to the app (even a tiny one).",good
"App keeps crashing when launching, couldn't even get past the title screen. Edit: After signing into the website version, tried to install the app again and apparently it worked!",good
"WHY? Why my habit streaks keep disappearing every single day!? :( Edit: Thank you, developers! I didn't notice that option I love this app❤️",good
"So far the best productivity app, with this being productive is fun",good
I soooo love this app. I am not a gamer but gamifying my habits makes it more interactive. You wouldn't want your avatar to die so you'll do your tasks.,good
"This app has helped me make my days more productive, and I like the way it's put together. Two suggestions for the devs: 1. Introduce an option to stay indefinitely at one level, only needing that fixed amount of xp to refill your hp. With the ever increasing xp requirement, eventually I won't be able to keep levelling up and will start dying, and that'll be demotivating. 2. Make a holiday mode that has a different set of dailies/habits. I'd like to have different goals on holiday.",good
I am in the unique circumstance of liking to gamify my life and also being horrible at incentivizing doing daily chores. This is literally the perfect app for me.,good
"So far, I love this app and the idea behind it. It holds me accountable for my tasks and habits which i really love. I would totally give it a shot.",good
"I moved to a new phone and can't restore my paid Pro login, so now I'm limited to the features of the free version.",poor
This app is really pretty annoying. it said I didn't allow any permissions but it gave absolutely no further instruction. So for a $1.99 I figured what do I have to lose. Well I have a lot of time to lose because I spent the money I now have the premium app I set the timer and I got the same message. It says you have not set permissions but it gives no instruction as to how to set permissions and no button that I click works. If it wasn't too much aggravation I'd be asking for a refund.,poor
Heart breaking to see that even app allow list requires premium membership. Please try to help people out and we are ready to support you through ads. I hope to receive a reply from the team.,poor
"REVIEW UPDATE: Not sometimes, now it's frequently happening that I can close the forest app and bypass the whole purpose. I can then use my phone to its full extent and forest is absolutely useless to me. I will have to try some other app. Old review: Sometimes the app lets me open apps and get through. The option to select 120 mins is great but they need to patch this bypass bug that's been happening. I'm on a pixel 2XL",poor
All the tree just got premium Leading to less free content,poor
I buyed new mobile and tried to login using it but wasn't able to do that.. I also tried by signing out other accounts but then also I couldn't.. Look into it,poor
"i just want to restore my acc, im just logged into it on my cell phone and i still can't",poor
Not able to restore my account in a new device. Very worst.,poor
It is a TERRIBLE app. It always says Forest has stopped working.i hate it. Dont download.,poor
"I have already installed it but i cant see it in my computer, i dont know what is wrong I installed it from google drive and....i cant see anything in my computer, if you can please tell me where can i find it , i would be so thankful!",poor
"I have been facing an issue with the app for quite a few days now. I stay on the app but my tree still dies. And after that it still gives me the notification that my tree has grown. So in essence I get neither my grown tree nor my coins even after I was on the app the whole time. Please fix this, as otherwise the app is really cool.",poor
"It often doesn't count exceeded time, which makes me frustrated. I already purchased premium and I regret it because of this problem",poor
Can't turn on Deep focus mode,poor
"I had to uninstall the app since it didn't open and kept stopping, when I reinstalled it all my progress and data was lost .",poor
"Worst app ever. Whenever I open it, THE ONLY THIHG IT DOES IS STOP.",poor
so disappointed with this app! I purchased the pro version then i changed my phone. I cannot log in my account they are asking me to purchase the pro version again. I purchased the pro version again but I'm really really really disappointed I WANT A REFUND THIS SO UNFAIR.,poor
Its not installing in my phone,poor
在app内付费了两次！没有升级到pro版本！restore显示error且没有refunded！I NEED MY MONEY BACK！！！,poor
Erdfyg,poor
"Poor service. I purchased the premium version, but I can't login again. When I choose the login function, the app always asks for redemption and has no function of filling in the account login.",poor
"Paid for the pro and im already annoyed. I have several dead trees they want me to pay to get rid of just because I was canceling to fix the ""deep mode"" settings that you cannot turn on after you started, but it doesnt even warn you its not on until you start, so its an automatic failure you can't rid of. Dumbest and most easily avoidable issue",poor
"Very useful app! The only thing I wish you put on the app is a pause button or something to point different moments in the work block. Excelent app I bought the pro version 'cause is very accesible. I wish you put more things to make this app the most incredible productivity app! 🤍 EDIT: I need help with the premium purchase!!! I send an email and one person responded my email but the problem was not solved. I want a refund please, I like the app but this problem is a Headache, sorry. :/",poor
Nope not a good app I can't log in it I'll find a better app,poor
"Disappointed. I have paid for the pro version. Due to space issues I had to delete this app,however I reinstalled it. Now I'm not able to restore my pro version as an error occurs nor am I able to login to my account. I have logged out of all other accounts as said in the error, yet I'm unable to use the pro features it's asking for payment again. On top of that your support doesn't even care to reply. Already mailed them twice. Seems that you only care until your customer buys the pro version.",poor
"I can not restore purchased, I already follow the instruction.. And then send email but get no response..",poor
I paid for preminum version but they took the money twice out of my account and didnt even activate my version. Kindly do the needfull,poor
Após a última atualização ficou péssimo o app.,poor
A sloth is faster than this app. Literally.,poor
This app is so annoying I mean already bought the pro version and I am locked out of my account. This app is a waste of time.,poor
"I already have subscription but still I'm not able to login . Everytime I click on login or sign-in ad for subscription comes up though I've 1year subscription .This happened after I upgraded it to the newer version. I've already paid for it, Please look into the matter.",poor
These people can't bring flora app to android as they consider iOS are rich,poor
"Todo era muy bonito hasta que pusieron todos los árboles guays en modo profesional. Los que conseguí hace tiempo con sudor y lágrimas me los van a quitar a final de año :( Mi vida ya no tiene sentido en esta app, estaréis contentos...",poor
"All beautiful plants are now in pro version...and for Students like me whose parents won't allow me buy pro version ,this app is now not that good. The update is very bad...I don't like it",poor
⚠️ Scam alert ⚠️ this is what happened. I purchased the app few weeks ago. It was great no issues in that. Then uninstalled it and reinstall it again. The problem is it didn't log into my pro version account. I contacted the support they asked me to do stuffs like clearing catches and other stuff. But I realized the problem was in the app. It didn't recognize me as a pro user and I have the PROOF OF MONEY TRANSACTION. I mailed then couple of times but no reply. I NEED MY MONEY.,poor
"I want to love this app, but every time I use it and every time I try to upgrade to premium, I get an ""Error 599"" message. Tried factory resetting my phone, even! Definitely a shame, as I was looking for an app to recommend to my students.",poor
hey why is it so hard to log in to my account. i need to restore my premium first to log in but the restore button isn't working. now im stuck with the free features. please fix your logging in interface,poor
"i paid for full version but im unable to restore after i reinstalled,pls look into it",poor
money wasting app,poor
"I update for new version but it cost money, then dont say that this app is freeeee!!!!",poor
I cannot log in myself to the app even though i just paid for it. The restore button doesnt work. It keep saying error. My 100php is wasted.,poor
I had planted many trees and finally after a long time I was able to earn 500 coins and purchase the sound of night sky and also had around a 100 coins left out with me. Two days later the app automatically went back to the initial form(like the way it was when I first downloaded it)and my hard earned night sky sound was gone and also the remaining coins (approximately 100 coins) were also gone. Ps:I did not change anything in the app.(This app has glitch). UNHAPPY :(,poor
I was a big fan for the longest time but with the newest update? Uninstalled.,poor
It was good at first but then I don't how but they asked me to unlock the various trees and forcibly asked me to give them coin.,poor
great app until the update. I really loved the app and accidently Uninstalled it but then remembered and downloaded... thinking back it was a great choice .,poor
Apps been goood. Helped me a lot Free features have now been changed and are only available on pro mode.,poor
"Edit: i am unable to restore my pro version back from the same account that i had purchased it, i have sent mails, To the premium support and to support forest. I'm getting the same reply that login from the purchase Account, but i am trying to login from the SAME ACCOUNT from which it was PURCHASED. yet I'm unable to LOGIN. I have shared the screenshot of the same in the mails, please check and help me.",poor
"I really liked this app until they started forcing me to upgrade to premium. It asked me to update and I did, turned out it was rhe worst decision I've made. I saw the responses to other ratings like this and I understand why it was done but couldn't you keep SOME nice looking trees?! I really hope you consider this over and make some nice looking trees for the free-version users. I won't delete this app yet but if this doesn't improve it is almost guaranteed that I will delete this.",poor
Pathetic update!! This is totally unfair! I am gonna uninstall this app immediately.,poor
Latest version 👎👎👎👎,poor
"I like tu use this program, but when ever I open the app , it says : unfortunately , forest has been stoped. And then it closed I don't know whats the problem and why?",poor
Why is everything set to premium? I am finding a open source version of this app.,poor
Was a good app but now many species can be accessed only for pro users😥,poor
It used to be great but now coins are useless since every cool looking tree is now behind a paywall.,poor
Worst update ever,poor
"It won't let me restore my premium account. Same phone, same google account.",poor
kinda sus that they made almost all of the trees and plants premium.. they really wanted people to go pro so that they can unlock new trees and plants.. this new update is honestly so unmotivating,poor
"It's not the best option for beating distractions, the makers of this app are extremely money minded.",poor
"Waste, concept is good but it was not wroth paying premium.",poor
I wasn't able to login to my account actually I'm a pro customer it's a bad experience.,poor
Old version was much better..why were the beautiful plants were moved to pro version?,poor
Not working at all.,poor
"This app was very benificial at first. But after you added almost every tree in premium version, I lost my interest. Even after the update, new tree added is not free. This is sickening.",poor
I am not able to sign in in this app.....,poor
"Attention. Can you add custom list of loud sounds endings of pomodoro app. You app should interrupt me after end of pomodoro , but I don't hear anything.",poor
"Unable to get new trees, store won't load (Error code 2903). Error message asks to reply via in-app feedback system which dosen't seem to be there in the settings plus FAQ and support page dosen't open either. Have updated the app to the most recent version, yet problem persists. Kindly resolve.",poor
I didn't like the upgrade. I couldve had various kinds trees!! Now I need to have the pro to get it :<,poor
Just give an option to go back to the old version. So unsatisfied and feel demotivated after the new update.,poor
"It used to be a really great app but then the problem arrive. It told me to update to latest version to see a new species but it was the worst update that could be ever made. With the new update , most of the good looking tree species have now been reserved for those who have unlocked the paid version. I'm really dissatisfied and disappointed cuz i have been using this app for the last two years. :(",poor
Mad Game App,poor
You can't unlock most of the trees until you pay for pro version,poor
The app was very good before the update. But now for everything they ask you to buy the pro version. non pro users can't even buy new trees to plant. It's really a shame.,poor
"Been using this app for over a year, it used to be great and many things were free but now they need you to PAY money for half the content. I have thousands of coins but since you need to buy with real money there's nothing to spend it on. A lot more intrusive ads have surfaced when before it was optional to get extra coins (yes we do notice these things). Been a disappointing downhill since its glory days but there are better apps now that do the exact same thing.",poor
Sooo baad game,poor
it keeps crushing down,poor
"My rating to this app just dropped from 5⭐ to 1⭐ mainly because of this company's marketing strategy on how to pressure someone or the previous users to buy their pro version. There were many beautiful trees in store where you can purchase for free with free version. Now, it's only possible by having the pro version. It's quite disappointing that this app doesn't allow you to feel motivated and pull you down by offering their worst trees masterpiece. I won't give my 5 ⭐ till this issue FIXED!",poor
"Amazing app for concentration and motivation. Would really appreciate it if there is an auto pomodoro function i.e. 5 min and 15 min breaks between 25 mins of work. Would seriously consider buying the pro version if it is available! Edit: Instead of improving functionality to incentivize users to buy the premium version, they paywalled most of the trees. Kinda beats the purpose since there's no incentive anymore.",poor
"Opened my app today just to see that almost all of the trees and plants are now behind a paywall. I understand the reasoning behind this decision but it's disheartening to see. Especially, since I've been saving up for wisteria for so long and now just can't access it. I don’t use this app often enough to justify purchasing the premium. Guess I'll just look into other apps like everyone else then.",poor
Unable to download...its already showing downloaded but it's not downloaded in my phone,poor
"This 1star is for new updated version....prev bersion was beautiful but new one sucks, it doesnt count time if phone is in battery savings mode...",poor
Well.....i have started today only....so later i will explain it,poor
"I give one star because I don't like this app because it like a mobile timer , in my mobile already timer",poor
"Can't even reset my password because every single time I get ""An error occured""",poor
"The attracting feature of this app were the variety of trees; this was also an incentive to study more, as that (if you used the app correctly) was the only way to unlock new tree species. You've taken this feature away for most users and kept a few, bland trees, as an obvious tactic to boost purchases, which is annoying. What's even more annoying is the disingenuous replies of ""pirated software"", (09/09/2020 response). Was going to give a 2 or 3 since it's now just an average app, but now a 1",poor
I HATED the update all the beautiful trees are now in the premium suction it was way fun when I was able to choose what ever tree I want and buy it with the money that I earned from the time that spent focusing now I'm earning money for nothing like what's the point ?,poor
"Helpful in staying on task or to not use my phone so much in distracting or unhelpful ways. Concern is that I was trying to get trees and now, just today, I noticed that certain species are no longer available. Disappointing. Edit: A lot of users are also finding it unfair that you took away an exciting part of the app. Us regular/ non- premium users are very disappointed. Change it back. Please stop generating automatic responses. Edit 2: Just as suspected, an auto response. No action.",poor
"All those nice features it says you can use? They sound pretty great don't they? Only problem is you have to pay for them. Like all of them. Yeah it's free, you just have to buy the premium version to do LITERALS ANYTHING. I was excited for this. I'm certainly disappointed.",poor
"Very bad decision doing that the most of the trees became a pro version, for this reason I uninstalled it.",poor
App is not opening in my phone. What may be the problem? I love to try this app. Please help me out .,poor
Awesome app But developer is Chinese Boycott China We want made in India app🇮🇳🇮🇳,poor
"Not working properly for me , The app crashes everytime i open it which is so stressfull . Im running on a andriod 4.4.4 which the devs claim that is supported although it litterally crashes as i open it.",poor
Not so good app,poor
"I'm lowering bcs of the now update. I find an awful decision to block most trees under pro. As other users have pointed, it takes most of the fun away from free users. I was very excited to rebuy some trees from other times I had the app but now I can't. I'll be uninstalling the app",poor
"It's a very bad app because I changed the settings too , but the tree 🌲 would die everytime if I opened another app or turned off my phone",poor
It's not working on my tablet Huawei T17..plz solve this soon..i rate it 5 bcz It's helping the environment...now i change it,poor
Without buying pro version u can't enjoy this spp,poor
I would give 5 star before the last update I used to do hard work for those expensive plants....Now i think i will uninstall the app son,poor
"Everyone's hungry for money and so is you,now I can't even plant those trees which I have already unlocked.Keep your app don't need this now.Uninstalling...",poor
"I purchased a big bag of time crystals on 28th of September. I sent a complaint because I was not able to redeem said purchase because there was some kind of error. The response team said they were on vacation until 5 October so I was patient with them. It is already 10 October and I already asked for multiple follow ups, and still no resolution (redeem or just reimburse me) of my problem. How long does it take for you to fix this. I've paid actual money for this. I love the app but response 👎",poor
It doesn't work for me. It always get out of the app,poor
Support tablet landscape mode please. Uninstalled,poor
The main aim of the app is to maintain focus while we are doing any work and hence it should provide app locks during our work but that app provide these feature to only paid members which is not bad but I think you should provide some main feature to free members also which will satisfy our wish of focusing. you can provide some additional features to paid members but to lock app is just main aspect you should provide it for alll,poor
"The app is crashing everytime I open in my Mi Pad, Android kitkat 4.4.2 device! Even unable to submit bug report as well!",poor
Error code 600 when I try to insert a friend code,poor
"Since the latest update, where you now always have to assign a tag, I will choose one, because I have to now, and then when I check on my timer a while later, the app will have changed the tag to something else for some reason.",poor
I cant believe the majority of the trees were moved to premium users only. I've been using this app for years and have watched tons of adds. Ill be looking for a new productivity app now that there is a ridiculous pay wall to use the different tree species.,poor
"I used to like this app and have motivation to actually use it, collect coins and buy new species of trees. But now all the cool stuff is only available in the paid version. Disappointed. Upd: stop with this pirated software BS. You did it because you're greedy little devs. Unfortunately, you will only lose customers instead of making money through ads. How sad",poor
Not at all satisfied about new update. Cannot unlock beautiful trees without pro version searching for similar apps and uninstall as soon as i find it,poor
Why can't we edit the tags rubbish gold diggers...,poor
why did all the trees have to be in the pro version it was not like that before this just makes the app so focused on money this sucks,poor
I cannot recover my vip purchase,poor
Disappointed me when asked for money : (,poor
"With the recent update I lost all coins and all my unlocked trees. And now I find that all the trees I had unlocked are blocked for the pro version. Not impressed, will be uninstalling this app",poor
"Really great app that works very well. Unfortunately I have to give one star because of the poor customer service. I would love to purchase the pro version but I was having issues, so I reached out months ago, and there was no response. Please fix this, I would like to support your app but this is not good at all.",poor
It's just not fair... I have been using this app for years. I can't buy the pro version because of the country where I live in (Iran). You just took everything away from the non pro users. I used to love this app but I see no respect. Deleted it. Sure looking for some other app,poor
"Disappointing, every tree that I wanted is in a pro version??? This used to be my favorite app.",poor
I can't FOCUS if my plant keeps dying. 🙂,poor
"All was well until the developers literally forcing me to upgrade to the premium version. I understand that everything CAN'T be for free BUT the numerous advertisements which I watched since last 2 years didn't generate any revenue? The trees which I bought with my coins went all into the premium version and now they are saying that I can't plant them until I upgrade. What the poppycock is this?! Without much ado, let me move on and get a new productive app.",poor
Why all the trees in pro version ?? they were free before... now i can't have those plants. change it....... change it now.....,poor
Very boring and irritating app..... Unusually robbering people.... Truely the new update is worst,poor
Loved this app until a lot of the trees were placed behind a paywall. There are similar apps out there without this feature.,poor
B AD,poor
I love this app but after the last update it won't work at all. :(,poor
Not working. Keeps force exit the app.,poor
It doesn't work anymore:(,poor
the new update locked several of the trees behind a paywall. this is disgraceful because all users should be able to unlock them by using the app. there is no justification for taking away important parts of the app that were previously available to everyone and now only premium users can access them. the devs must change this back so that all previously released trees can be unlocked by anyone. edit: there are many other reviews with the same problem but the devs don't care. LISTEN TO THE USERS,poor
"Used to love this app, but I got a new phone (Pixel 4a) and its all screwed up now. It won't let me restore my purchases and the buttons are misaligned so the back button is hidden under the camera. I get stuck and have to close the app to exit the screen. Really disappointing.",poor
"it is extremely disappointing that most of the trees now fall under the pro version and the developer is basically forcing the free users to buy the pro version and pay money,, and it's not like I didn't contribute to this application's revenue since I've watched thousands of advertisements over the past few years so this new update is really frustrating. what's the point of allowing people to download it for free if you are just going to restrict it so much and take away so many features?",poor
I already bought this app a year ago. I just got a new phone and it keeps on pushing me to buy premium when I've already bought it. Logging will also push you to buy the premium. I've tried to click Forget Password but it send the email VERY LATE.,poor
"I am highly disappointed by the latest version of this app, all the beautiful tree species have been limited to pro version and I don't find any reason to let this app be in my phone. Probably going to delete in few days. :(",poor
"I really love this app, as it really helps my focus on my work. But the recent update took away all of my motivation to collect coins to buy new species of trees. I'm not a premium user and not being able to collect all of the species makes me very sad.",poor
It used to be great but ever since it updated it doesn't work and it let's me go onto other apps while in use which defeats the purpose of the app. I was going to upgrade to premium but now that its not working I don't dare risk it if even the basic features don't work then I doubt that the premium ones will.,poor
"This is the worst app ever. My password was breached and my information may have been leaked to third parties. It won't let me delete my account or even change my password. You should be ashamed that you made an app that takes people's information like this, and then you don't have the courtesy to give them the option to delete their account. Literally the worst. Get yourselves sorted.",poor
"For a producticity app they sure are unproductive. I sent them messages regarding some glitches in my app. Four months later, no follow-ups, no solutions.",poor
why did you take away the option to unlock trees with coins? that's dumb. edit: i've read your reply and believe that better services were not provided and operations were not improved,poor
What's the problem!!!!!!! I don't like it coz it always says that the game has stooped u nfortunatelly,poor
Not bad.,poor
"Awesome app, really motivates to ditch the phone but I just purchased premium and the app didn't get updated. It says your payment was cancelled even when the amount is deducted and the bank showed ""payment successful"". Did I just waste my money? Please solve this problem. I have the latest version of the app... it's up to date. I also wrote a mail but there has been no reply till now.",poor
Force closing after recent update on all samsung devices.,poor
Very very bad,poor
Dont know what they did but this app doesnt work on my Android 10 device anymore. Lags for ages then just stops working and shuts down. Not helpful. Now my forest wont grow and will become neglected because I am uninstalling this app next and I doubt I'll ever use it again.,poor
This is worst app....single star dena majboori th...nhi to wo bh n deta....mera premium ke liye 129 rupees pay ho gya aur yha pe premium bh nhi mila....ye log bina login ke payment krate h...to kya proof h ki kisne payment ki.....this is worst app don't pay,poor
I was thinking about buying the pro version when i have the availability of all the trees for the other benefits but at the very end they put all the good trees in pro version kind of forcing me to buy it. That sucks and makes this app good for nothing.,poor
"Too many ads, find another alternatve with no ads or at least not as many.",poor
"Hearing other peoples experiences really ruins the app for me. I'm a pro user, I didn't know that all the trees were behind a pay wall now. But to make that change, it's really disappointing. It takes away all the fun, all the hard work people have made to buy trees. And you guys don't care, you just copy and paste the same trashy response. I honestly don't think that putting everything behind a pay wall will ""prevent pirated software"". Won't people want to pirate it more when the fun is gone?",poor
Fazol app,poor
Premium should be free,poor
When I downloaded it is coming fail to try,poor
Good app,poor
Not bad,poor
"Dear Forest. As a loyal user I'm deeply disappointed in your current business tactics. It seems your team has not understood how to go about this. Perhaps you need to consult with someone, cuz you're not only frustrating potential new customers, but also old ones. I cant believe every feature for new users is blocked- how am I supposed to get someone to purchase when they cant experience the app? Ive unlocked every tree, have 16k+ coins & feel betrayed by this new referral nonsense. Get help.",poor
"Everything was great until developers started literally pushing me to buy a premium version. Now I found out that all cool designed trees are moved to premium version.Sorry not sorry,yet there should be a little piece of respect towards your loyal customers who have been using these app for years (personally I've been using it since 2017). I understand that there couldn't be everything for free but still you could keep at least some nice options for other users. I'm so sad yet I will delete it",poor
Everything is locked in premium. No use for basic version,poor
Its not even opening 😠😠😡😠😡😠😡😠😠 this don't deserve even one star. This is just a wastage of time and data .,poor
i am not able to login kn my account. i have a pro subscription. please help,poor
I am not able to log in There's not option to log in They ask to register again,poor
after September update it's annoying,poor
I'm a premium member...After updating I'm unable to get that pear tree house..pls look into this issue,poor
The app is not working on my phone. It keeps crashing. I've complained multiple times. I've also sent emails detailing all the problems but i haven't gotten a single reply. This started as soon as i bought the premium version of the app.,poor
"Cant restore in app purchases so I paid again the pro version Then, my trees didnt come back after signing in my account. Can you fix this?",poor
I liked this app this is verry nice aap,poor
Used to be great until they became too pushy to upgrade to the paid version. Now you need to be on the pro version to buy designer trees as compared to the early days where you could just purchase them even on the free version. Quite disappointed with the development team frankly.,poor
I don't know what's go in on cause from yesterday my forest It doesn't work I'm so sad cause I love this app please fix it,poor
"doesnt really work for me personally, you might feel it differently however",poor
Wow,poor
"App just sucks. And don't say you made changes to prevent piracy, that's just a pathetic excuse. This is just a BLATANT MONEY GRAB! YOU FOOLS ARE PATHETIC! GET A DAMN LIFE LOSERS! Revert this app back to what it used to be and you will find people coming back in DROVES! Until then, just watch them all leave.",poor
Horrible update,poor
Very good app for students,poor
"I really liked it until the new ""pro version"" update",poor
It should be free for all and focused defined,poor
I bought premium and reset my phone and I can't get my pro account anymore. Can y'all fix that or something,poor
"Why everytime I try to login to my account, the software ask me repurchase. Right now, I am unable to login to my purchased software.",poor
It was a good app. I made premium purchase yesterday and unknowingly cleared my data today. Now I can't login and asking me to buy again. Please look into this. Many of my friends facing the same issue. Please make login a feature in the app 🥺🥺😭,poor
"Lost My Premium Account Due to a recent update , the app kept crashing , hence I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it again. Ever since then I'm unable to recover my Premium account and have lost all the special trees, data about my studying hours and basically everything. I have tried contacting the company through mail, NO Response. WOW ! That is not the response a customer would expect when he is robbed off the app he just purchased. No reply for the Mail either. People dont buy this Sham",poor
Why do you lock everything in new updates? I used to love this app but I'm uninstall it,poor
"Multiple times they showed that coins doubled after rewarded ad but in reality only half the amount would be added. What a trick to get your sponsors their target and fool us, didn't expect this!",poor
It is useless. Even after planting the tree app does not stop me.,poor
"I bought the pro version, however it doesn't unlock the tree species?why is that?",poor
"I really loved this app. I used it regularly and planting my forest really motivated me to keep going on. Unfortunately from the September update on almost all trees are behind a pay wall now. I understand you cannot do everything for free, but the trees should at least be available for coins you can earn for using this app. I'm not sure if you are really reading this, but you don't have to copy and paste your standard answer to my comment as well. You already did it to a bunch of others.",poor
"It's a bit pathetic that rather than adding new features to encourage people to switch to a paid version, features have been removed to make the free version less appealing. The number of trees available to purchase no matter how many ads you watch is now nothing compared to the past.",poor
"I liked the app so paid for the premium edition, however it doesn't let me log in on my primary phone. The login screen keeps sending me to new purchase page instead of actually giving me a login. Both my devices are android phones. Disappointed.",poor
This app does not notify me when the pomodoro is done. I just end up working for an hour or two. Useless.,poor
This used to be a great app but the quality has gone down over time,poor
"I was using this quite a bit, but now I'll lose trees about half the time from things like notifications from android manager, voicemail notifications, etc, and it won't let me add any of the phones system apps to my white list. *edit* I've reduced to one star after getting a new phone, was unable to switch with this app and lost all my progress. Also so many features are pay walled now! I can't even have a white list anymore unless I pay.",poor
I found a replacement for you now and I am very happy 😊. It's the study bunny app and has all the features which your pro version has in free . Uninstalling this app .,poor
"I HAVE PURCHASE PRO MODE BUT MY LITTLE SISTER ACCIDENTALLY UNINSTALL IT, AND NOW I CAN'T LOGIN AGAIN BECAUSE I HAD TO PURCHASE IT AGAIN. I CAN'T EVEN RESTORE IT! PLEASE FIX IT SO I CAN LOGIN AGAIN! PLEASE!",poor
It's very bad,poor
"help when i try to log back into my pro account when i press restore it wont let me, saying to use my original google account and log out of my other ones when i never changed my google account at all???",poor
"Ever since the update I been unable to log in to my account despite only having the account I purchased the premium and can't even do forget password as it won't send me an email. And seriously what's the point now with the new updates, small trees size and look bland. This used to be good.",poor
It doesn't work on multiple devices,poor
It would be 5 star but 1 star for you dammm new update which is purchasing plants😤😤😤,poor
It doesnt guide me back when i leave the app,poor
I used to enjoy this app but with the most recent update I have no more incentive in using this app because there's basically no more trees that k can buy without paying for the pro version. I'll be looking for another app to use instead of this one.,poor
Got much worse after update.. I LOST ALL My paid trees that i had purchased...... i am looted...... return my species,poor
"Just purchase pro version. Can't sync through my devices, can't restore purchase also. Totally scam Ps: already tried your suggestion and not working. I purchase other app before & not have any problem even I use many phone",poor
फर्जी,poor
"I used to give this app a 5 star rating before the new update... it used to be such a fun and helpful app to keep people motivated by letting them collect all those pretty trees.. now non-pro users barely have any trees to choose from☹ i was planning to do themed gardens each month, i guess now thats down the drain😞",poor
"Loved the app, was saving in game currency for a weeping willow that was listed as free. Only needed 100 more coins to purchase it but with the recent update almost 60% of trees have turned to premium...throughly disappointed.",poor
Not able to understand how to use this productive app,poor
"App used to be great, until the update .. 😢 Please consider making some trees free again for free users. I really miss enjoying this app😞😞. I understand how they need the money.. But they didnt have to cause such an inconvenience to the free users by leaving them without any good stuff 😣😣 EDIT: seriously An Automatic reply?... shows how much y'all cared.. disgusting",poor
I bought the pro version and now I am not able to login again. Everytime it's asking me to sign-up again and for that you have to buy the pro version again. I don't know is this is the problem with the latest update but I am not getting option to login,poor
their should be alarm type sound when we complete some task,poor
"Extremely frustrating that the free version has been strip-mined and had pretty much all content locked behind the premium wall. I'm really fond of the app and its functionality, but it's very discouraging to have had the 'fun' aspects removed from the base version.",poor
"Earlier this app used to have a large varieties of trees available, which could be bought by the coins that you collected from your study sessions. But now, all those varieties of tree species can be unlocked only after buying their PRO version. So there isn't really much use left of the app if you dont want to get the pro version",poor
Initially it was a very great experience with this app but nowadays the app suddenly gets closed and the tree gets dead.,poor
This program has gotten worse by updating. This is not acceptable,poor
"No real objective, I dont see the difference from a simple timer. The app is still good, but you can't really look at your forest and say ""wow"" and get motivated. I think this app doesnt keep its promises :) Also I have no sound so I dont know when the timer goes off which does not do the job (it works for others people tho).",poor
I think that forest is so good,poor
"I bought the app , but when I change the handset it is failing to restore the pro version. It is very annoying.",poor
"I left the app and my tree still didn't die lol like I could still use twitter, instagram etc.",poor
This app has big issues. It allows other apps to be used even though they have been restricted from use during a tree planting. This is despite blocking those apps in the allow list It kept crushing so I uninstalled it and put it back on. All my progress from when I started planting trees was lost and I use a pro version. One should be able to recover those planted trees surely. After all I'm using the pro version .,poor
Used to like this app alot but now I have less motivation in earning coins since I have to get premium to get the trees i want. 😔 Saw the developer's reply in others' alike review but I hope they make an effort to create trees that compensate the update.,poor
This is good app but very stick app I give 2 star because little little I don't understand this app.,poor
"I don't mind giving pro users some advantages but this is too much! way too many tree species need to be unlocked with money now, and I looked forward to unlocking them! I was even thinking of buying the premium but after this update I don't want to anymore. Very dissapointed",poor
The app keeps hanging . I have to uninstall and then reinstall it once every 3-4 days. Please fix the bug.,poor
"I did love the forest app.... UNTIL the recent update. I hardly EVER update my apps! Now its not possible to buy new trees, they are only available for pro users and not with coins. Lame. Super lame.",poor
Totally a black screen coming when ever we are trying to watch an ad to double up coins plz fix this issue,poor
"Hi can you please add pershian language? 🥺 So you mean you can not add pershian language? 🥺 Some of our people are use your app to. And Please add a stop feature to your app So that in the moments when something happens to us, we can stop and not think that we were reading the whole time we had planned (doing the useful work) so that our trees would grow more fully. Tanks 🌻",poor
WE NEED AN ALARM TONE AFTER TIMER ⏲ IS DONE. 📣 (PREMIUM USER) I often went OVER time because I don't notice my tree has already grown. (I turn off the bg music cuz it's distracting for me. I prefer piano music.) The excess time I went over could have been used to grow MORE trees. PLS ADD AN ALARM TONE! Thank you.,poor
"Does everything the app says and it's good. HOWEVER, you cannot restore your pro version no matter how much you try. Once you log out, your account is good as gone. Don't buy the pro version until they fix it.",poor
Bought premium on one device which worked well. Have recently changed device but am unable to login due to a pop-up asking to pay for premium. *Edit The new device is also android. I ended up rebuying premium,poor
Absolutely loved this app when I first got it. After the new update I'm very disappointed to see that most of the content is locked for non Pro users. I had an entire plan for which trees I still wanted to get and the newest species looks awesome! But now I have to PAY to unlock it? The little trees were my number 1 motivation to use this app and get my work done in the first place... now I can't even do that.,poor
"Initially I liked the apk , but later many times the time was not counted phubing. I am really disappointed bcoz I purchased the apk to early without knowing this glitch.",poor
The last update is soooo wrong. I'm losing my hours.,poor
I didn't like it.😐😐,poor
"I really loved this app. But I'm not happy with new version at all. It was motivational for me to focus more, gain more coins and buy expensive trees. But now you have omitted all of the interesting species for free version and it is not enjoyable for me any more. I live in Iran so I can not purchase the pro version and I am pretty sure I'm not alone in this. I hope you find away to get back everything to normal cause I am definitly in love with this app.",poor
I really liked it at first and one of the main reasons that attract me was. The beautiful trees and now free users can only have limited trees and I don't even like one of them so I'm removing this from my favourite app list. Time to find another one. I'm really disappointed...,poor
It take to much time,poor
I was genuinely considering buying the pro version because I really liked this app but the latest update made a bunch of the trees premium only and I had just saved enough coins to buy another and now I can't get one of the ones I wanted and I'm very angry so now I don't want to anymore.,poor
"This app has definitely helped me put my phone down, but you peak fairly quickly in the unpaid version and run out of rewards. After using it for six months, I've run out of trees and plants to purchase, so there's not much more to ""add"" to the experience in terms of utilizing my coins. When I get a new phone I wasn't able to transfer my account and discovered that the unpaid version has even fewer options available than before.",poor
Helps me focus greatly but I cant connect to my other devices. I bought the app with my iPad but I cant log in through my android phone to access any of the data or my trees,poor
"I used to LOVE this app. It felt really rewarding to have focused long enough to buy a cool new plant you've been saving up for.... Now, those trees are locked behind a ""premium"" wall... they're charging you for content they offered for free before. It seems like they're taking advantage of their users and charging money for an app catered towards helping broke college students study. Seems wrong, especially during such hard economic and social times. I'm a long time user offering 2 stars.",poor
Used to be a good app. Now it is limited. Students don't have that much to pay for every app they use.,poor
Nothing interesting unless you get premium 😕 at least let us buy trees by watching some ads,poor
"time to find another app........ the pro version is really good and i understand it is needed to provide good services, but there are plenty of other versions rather than making only 10 trees available for free version users. put more adds, add in-app purchase to purchase like coins or an upgraded coins like every game app do, make special tree more expensive in coins... this update really kills the appeal of this app.",poor
"I'm writing this review while my tree is growing. I can't turn on the android focus mode, but facebook works fine, so what is the point of this app? I've enabled all the permissions, but it doesn't block chrome or facebook.",poor
Used to love the app. They make you give phone access to be in leader boards and buy premium for interesting trees. I understand they are worried about pirated software but they are sacrificing their user base in exchange.,poor
"App is very useful but most fun part - planting trees is annoying. There are very few species available. Even though I bought premium I still need to ""focus"" approximately 4000 minutes just to buy 1 2k tree Another feature I would like to have is arranging my forest as I want. Currently trees appear randomly.",poor
I have been using Forest for a few years now and I have switched to an iPhone 11 now but they are asking me to purchase the app to access it. The app is free on android so should I pay for AppleStore?,poor
App is really good at a time. But after the last few updates you made everything premium. We can't even buy new tree species that looks good. That's boreing to plant same kinda trees everyday . Then what can we do with in game money if we can't buy any of them. What are you trying to do. You will loose too many of users by doing these kinda things. So please do something with this stuff please........ Its a request please reply if you agree..,poor
"1) If I want to be in leaderboard, I need to give the app permission to all of my private things. No thanks. 2) The achievements always show there's a new achievement unlocked, but there's actually none. This bug is often fixed and then reappears, which is annoying. Otherwise the app is alright. Lots of bugs but they get fixed fast. The part I hate most is the privacy issue because I used to be encouraged by the leaderboard, but I'm not going to give an app such access. Sad. I miss the feature.",poor
It keeps closing the app.,poor
"I enable those options, but when I close the program completely, I can still enter other programs. Please help",poor
"I loved it. Great concept, but I need a calendar and planner too.",poor
"It's a good application overall but... The thing which I remember came with an update the trees you can not plant all of them, thats the reason why I am giving two stars trees make it more interesting and what made the application with pay to plant is bad.",poor
Love it but had to leave a review bcz of the policy so that I can get that lovely free plant,poor
"So far good, it would be really good if the developers added a pause function to the app so that if something comes up during your study or focus period, you can easily pause and come back to where you left of. As the time is just going when other things come into focus.",poor
What is 599 error??? It just stop me using this app!! Hate that!,poor
It seems your pro app for most android user has error: 600 when they use referral codes for friend invitation. I hope you fix it as soon as you can.,poor
"Hi even when the deep focus mode is on I am still able to go to different apps, and at same time my trees are also growing..!! I saw a youtube video od 20 minites and meanwhile.my 15 minute grew completely. I am 100 sure that deep focus mode was on, as it told me in the app. U should check on that..",poor
feelings disappointed bcs i paid for nothing. you should've let the premium user get at least 5 or more new trees. it was such a large amount of money just for a tree and some little feature.,poor
"This app used to be the app I rely on everyday to focus on my studies but after the recent update, users are literally forced to upgrade to premium to unlock a variety of tress. I understand that the organisation needs some sort of income but still, to make most (80%)of the trees unavailable to free users, I am utterly disappointed.",poor
"Reducing my rating because after their new update, you cannot unlock most of the trees unless you upgrade to premium. Really affects the experience",poor
"Entiendo que todos debemos ganar dinero y que tal vez la situación no está fácil para nadie. Sin embargo, se podrían poner más anuncios y dejar más opciones de diferentes árboles para quienes no somos premium; lo emocionante de la app consistía en concentrarse más seguido para ganar monedas y así comprar el árbol para el que ahorrarás. Ahora, con las limitaciones, ya lo es emocionante... Igual es muy funcional pero era mejor. En todo caso, es entendible y respetable las nuevas actualizaciones.",poor
"This app was good, until I purchased the Pro Version. I was saving up coins to buy a 2k tree. When I was finally able to buy it, the system keeps on saying that I did not have enough coins. I tried buying a 600 coin tree and suddenly, my coin went down to 500. From 2k to 500, and I only bought a 600 coin tree. It happened twice already, and this is frustrating.",poor
The most inconvenience I have faced is that the notification sound is not even audible after the tree has completely planted. This make me even more distracted to keep checking on this. Hope forest will take this issue into serious consideration as I was so disappointed by this bug after I have purchased the pro version.,poor
pay money for tree 🌲 :(,poor
"I really enjoyed using this app until the September update forced all free users behind a paywall with just a few basic options. In consideration of the pandemic and many folks enjoy the simplicity of this focus app while getting a handle on their own lives, I disagree with the decision of this move. I am not sure what to do with the coins earned since I have all the basic options.",poor
Since the update I am not able to open the store,poor
Cant log in after an uninstall. When i press log in i get a pro pop up. But i already have pro. Just let me log in!!!!! Furthermore it just gives me an error when i try to restore purchase. Incredibly disappointed. Loved the app but now i feel robbed. Please fix,poor
Had this app for about 2 years. I had earned almost 5000 points. I got a new phone and everything I had is gone. I have the same number and my email addresses are all synced.. but none of my earnings or unlocks are here.. I feel sort of reluctant to use it now.,poor
"There should be a notification once you are done with your task. It'll help. Please update this thing in it. A notification, a beep or any sound please",poor
Drain phone battery when not using it,poor
Its good,poor
"Until recent update it was a 5 star. If you bring changes make sure your customer services are reponsive too at that time. The friendship redeem option didnt appear in settings after update, so i reinstalled same device,now i cant restore at all, ""error says sign out of other accounts"" i use only one email and i will not factory reset my phone for one app. Dont go blind over money, I really want to help plant trees, now everything looks like money grab.",poor
"I use the app for years, on my iphone and laptop and I love everything about it. However, I purchased a tablet lately, I downloaded forest and when I try to log in, there's nothing but the pro-version ad. Sadly I can't use my account.",poor
This app nothing help in focused because i start this app timer after that i can easily open any app but the timer going on continuosly the tree cannot shrink. Please fix this problem after than this app rate 5 stars.,poor
Even after I've enabled deep focus I can use apps that are not in the allowed list. Sometimes the blocking of apps doesn't work.,poor
Good apps,poor
Good job,poor
Looks cool but i had to uninstall the app because it wont go to sd storage.,poor
"I wanted to like it, but many dealbreakers. No alarm at end of session. No way to automatically go between breaks and work sessions, no way to automatically alternate between short and long breaks, no way to customize alarms that signify end of session. Contacted premium support re: no alarm- no response. Also- when you enter your birthday to register for premium, it's in a calendar form- it's much easier to enter a birthday by typing mm/dd/yyyy or to use a drag down menu for m, d, and year.",poor
"So disappointed. I love this app and it's made my study life so much better. I used to recommend it to everyone. Just when i save up enough coins to buy the maple tree i want, i go to the store and the app has updated, making 90% of all the trees except plain GRASS offered only for premium subscription. Super disappointing because i love the app but I'm not paying $3 just to get a virtual maple tree smh",poor
"Stupid premium, upgraded version for planting trees 🌳. Not fair 😑",poor
"The new update was ridiculous. I have tried so hard to get enough money for my favorite trees but they had been moved to pro version. As no more motivation I have, I uninstall this app",poor
Cannot login to my pro version after reformatting my phone. :(,poor
Okay,poor
"Hey, I am unable to restore purchase on a new phone, is there anything I can do because there is an error after i clicked restore purchase",poor
I live in Iran.I can't use the app because of payment problems. 😑😒 I have to uninstall it.,poor
"The new update is worse. I used to love it but the new interface is not at all good. Almost 60% of the trees are now in the pro version, which leave almost nothing for the non pro version users. And the trees look very small which selection in the new layout. Previously it was good. I hope all these shall be rectified in the later versions",poor
The new update is really disappointing. I was truly enjoying the app and watching my forest grow.,poor
"I like the concept and have found a lot of utility out of the free version. I bought the pro version for 1.99 to show gratitude, but now I can't double the amount of in game currency I earn by watching an ad. You use the in game currency to buy different types of plants, and with pro, most plants are almost 10x the price. So with pro, you earn 50% in game currency and need 10x to buy most plants. That's 20x the time. Seems like a shameless way to try and hawk micro purchases of in game currency",poor
This used to be such a great app... But since the new update we cannot purchase new species of trees... Additional to that the promotional adds have increased. The iOS users aren't paying a single penny extra for anything either pro version or having a group timer even all the species are available. This is not done... You have snatched the mere basic content of the app from Android users.,poor
"La aplicación no da ninguna notificación posterior al tiempo que seleccione por lo que no sé realmente cuanto tiempo he estado estudiando ni sé manejar mis tiempos de descanso. Ya realice los pasos sugeridos por la aplicación y aún así no me notifica nada. Mi celular es Huawei, no sé si esa sea la razón.",poor
"I love this app and would have happily given it five stars or more, but all the trees ive unlocked were relocked and im very unhappy. Ive always had the pro version, i should have my trees.",poor
There is some problem. It no longer gives me warning and redirects me back to forest when I use some other app.,poor
I wish I could set 4 to 5 hours at a time. And I hate those ads popping up whenever I open the app.,poor
"Agak sedih karena ada yang berbayar dan fiturnya sedikit, tapi enak sih buat ngatur waktu doang mah",poor
Just stay off your phone 😂,poor
I now have a strong dislike for this app. I've had it for a little while now but the fact that I now have to pay for pro for most of the trees is ridiculous. It was fine before. Why do these app developers mess things up like this?,poor
Guys what the hell is pro version.. I collected coins to buy the 2k tree but now I can't 😒m giving u two stars cz I aced in my exam cz of this app.. But the pro version is really disappointing..😢,poor
I request the seekrtech team to please add some tree species to the free version. Please! It is a humble request 😔,poor
Edit: I've had his app for a long time. I was here back when the app whitelist was a free feature. In the latest update the free version is much more limited and free users can't even buy all the trees anymore. It's frustrating to see all the good features of this app being hidden away. I understand new updates like the detailed stats and planting with friends being exclusive to the pro version or making newer trees exclusive but please give the old trees back!,poor
"I would like to see different colours of trees depending on what their tag is (eg. study, rest, entertainment etc.) so that I know how exactly I spent my time with just one look.",poor
"Incredibly disappointed with the new update. This app used to be visually pleasing because of the vast variety of trees, but now you have to pay for every good aspect of this app. While I understand the developers need (and deserve) money, there is a limit.",poor
basically if you don't have the pro version you can't use 90% of the app such a good app but you have to pay for each and every new options for studying like pie chart trackers 😒no good,poor
This app is really very good ....but I'm disappointed with the new update.... majority of the tress have been added to the pro version ...I happily updated to see if any new species is added ... I recommended it to many of my friends .... but I'm seriously very disappointed,poor
I realy like this app. Rhe thing is that you only can buy some specific trees and for the others you need the pro version and befor you just can buy more trees.,poor
"this app has become more and more money driven. as someone who has been using this for years and across multiple devices, this is really disappointing. more and more features that used to be free are being locked behind a paywall. hopefully someone comes out with a similar app because the concept is good but now everyth needs to be paid for.",poor
"Sad that the feature of being able to pick which apps can be blocked are for the pro version only :( as well as many of the other tree species :(( i've saved up some coins to be able to buy one of the more expensive ones but now i won't be able to unless i buy pro which is a shame :( what species left for the free version is also very few now :(( not as fun to use this app now, but i guess i understand the need for money.",poor
"I loved this app and there was so much to look forward to, until i got limited to 7 trees and everything that actually getting me excited to work harder just got locked. I can understand the reason for making the pro version better but I dont see why u had to make the free version borderline useless to do that.",poor
It say over 25 mil downloads and there are only 10 mil downloads,poor
"They just had to lock away half of the unlockable trees. It was hard earning coins day by day hoping one day to unlock all trees. Frequently, I'd watch ads to double the coins I'll earn. But now since they locked them up for good. I guess this coins of mine are only good for deleting my record for dying trees.",poor
I hate how I now have to get the Pro version to plant the trees that I like. Maybe give more trees in the free version or give more veriety? The nine free ones don't really give me motivation to finish anything.,poor
"Who would want to continue using the app for free with such limited trees? I guess this app isn't student friendly, such a shame. It was really a big help to me, it's sad to finally uninstall after a long time of use.",poor
"The ads don't always give you double coins bc there are some you can't close and they just loop when they're done, so the only thing you can do is close the app and then you don't get double coins. Edit: bug is mostly fixed. The way to opt out of the second ad now appears after ~5 seconds. Unfortunately the update locked most of the unlockable tree species behind a paywall so the app just got a whole lot less interesting for me :/",poor
Quite disappointed after the recent updates... You are trying to monetize everything... You may end up loosing your worthy and loyal customers by this predatory approach...,poor
"What motivated me to keep using the app was collecting coins to unlock different trees. Now, to unlock must of them, is not enough to collect coins... now you have to have the ""pro"" version! I was earning to get the sunflowers... Why? WHY!? I'll have to found another app. Also, I don't think it's ok to only plant trees in real life only having the pro version :( use ecosia browser instead (not sponsored) and stop monopolizing our planet's health.",poor
I used to love this app but I'm disappointed with the new update that has so limited free tree selection. Please fix that!,poor
Băgați și limba română!,poor
I liked it before the new update :(,poor
Era bom até atualizarem e você ser obrigado a pagar para desbloquear outras plantas :/,poor
He ha,poor
"I used to love working with this aoo and it was helpful. But the recent update is frustrating. It sounds vast inequality among your paid and unpaid users. And it seems foolish to paid only for some species while you can get other effective apps for free. Mu aim is to upgrade my focus, not to buy trees. So really upset for this unfriendly update and yes, uninstalling it.",poor
I am really unhappy 😞 with this app now .....I was working hard to buy a new tree and now you have converted all into pro version..... Irrespective of thinking of people who can't afford🙁,poor
"It's a good app to block your phone if you want to focus for some time. The thing is, it is not as good if what you want is to stop over-using your phone altogether. Also the last change of moving certain tree species (most of them, almost all) to premium is kind of lame, since so many functions are already only available for premium accounts. Couple that with how much time it takes to get a tree and this change seems unnecessary (since use time also means more adds watched and more revenue).",poor
The last updated is so bad 😔 i used to use forest about 2y and now i uninstall it im so sad cuz its been like my friend and do help me alot in terms of studying i cant buy the pro version bye bye forest 💔,poor
I really don't like the new update.All the trees are locked and you need to buy the pro version to unlocked it.,poor
"I'd give it five stars but the last update ruined it for me. I was collecting coins to purchase more trees. But since almost all trees are locked now, I lack the motivation to use it.",poor
He guys,poor
I tried a couple of time but still can't install it. I tried other apps and they are ok,poor
I used to love this app and use it always but why have you made all of the special trees only for pro users? I used to continue planting trees to earn coins for new trees but now my coins are for nothing,poor
My app updated and now almost all the tree options are locked behind a pay wall? This is such a disappointment when I've been saving up my coins! Not a fan. Uninstalled.,poor
The latest upgrade is so mean!! You could've added all the upcoming trees for the pro version gradually. But almost all old trees are now for pro. Seriously? :(,poor
"The app is really cool, but now almost everything is going to be premium? Just make it a pay app",poor
"I used to love this app. Unfortunately, the new update took away the features I liked the most unless you pay for premium (used to be free!). The app white list is now premium only, as are many of the trees I used to have before getting a new phone. Very disappointed, will need to find a new app",poor
"It worked well initially , but then started crashing each time I opened it. I reintalled it and it was working fine for the first week , but then again crashed . Everytime it crashed, all my progress was lost",poor
"App keeps crashing. Edit: App is working fine now! 5 Stars :) Edit 2: Crashing again, have to uninstall and reinstall to make it work",poor
Whatttt!??!?? This app is connected to my other account...??? And I'm not able to change it. I can't pay right now for the pro version because it's connected to a different account. How do I solve thisss????? Help!!!!!!! :-| The app is nice and I need the pro version. !?!?!?,poor
The controls don't work sometimes.,poor
Great concept until I noticed how intrusive this app is in monitoring user activity,poor
"I was super excited to use this app, as it was the only one of it's kind I could find that allowed me to choose apps I could still use. As a collage student who uses a time-table app, this sounded really useful! But then I found out that this feature is locked behind a paywall. Every other prenium feature is fine as prenium, but I cannot get behind this one being locked. I'll have to find another app.",poor
Isn't really helpful because one can tap on the home button and continue using phone while the tree is still growing.,poor

The app is getting crashed. Please fix it.,poor
Seema Pant I think this app is useful but in this app we have to pay also but its an nice app,poor

Keeps on crashing :(,poor
"I am facing problem from the past month. Whenever i click on forest option to view my forest, it shows that i had planted 0 trees but i had planted nearly 100 treez! After refreshing 10 times that to back button behaves as refresh button i could see my forest!",poor
I paid for the premium version. Now it asks for crazy intrusive permissions just to function properly.,poor
"The app interface is pretty good, but alot of bot's if you check global settings so It doesn't give a realistic feel if you are checking or comparing yourself. It would be great if they can verify user status !!",poor
Bekar experince...after 1-2hour there is a crash in app,poor
Awesome ...increase ur productivity,poor
Not what I was looking for,poor
"You can off the closing app , beside it has time for dont use it didn't say how much do you use you phone , nothing , but you can off your phone up to 120min , only",poor
"It has a ckiche. Everytime i try to open the app, it closes. I have to uninstall to get back to the app",poor
Hey actually it's the best app for productivity however every other day it keeps getting crashed and I have to reinstall the app again the next day. Please fix this issue at the earliest.,poor
I would have given 5 stars but this application crashes a lot. Due to this we have to reinstall the app and all our achievements are lost. Kindly look into this.,poor
idk if it only happens to me if you do not apply for the premium membership my app gets crashed and it does not open but other times it is really halpful. :-),poor
Its really nice app for making us focused but every day it doesnt opens and all my data goes ad every day i have to install uninstall very annoying now fed up plzz fix it as fast as u can getting so much irritated 😠😠😠what d hell. Yar every two days this app is geting crash and doesn't open just tell wwhat to do such a headache am fed up its notgetting right this is 6th time i have been installing becoz it works three days and fourth day doesnt opens updating also done then alsoissuenotsolve,poor
"The app is great except that after the update, it stopped working. I lost most of my data. I really love it so I gave it one more try and reinstall it. Then it stopped working. I reinstalled 3 times and it still stopped working. I was really mad. The app idea is great but why the programming so bad?",poor
It was really good at first and I loved it. But then the app was not working properly. So I had to uninstall it.,poor
It worked properly once later its asking to upgrade and app is not opening Rest the features and everything is good,poor
One more feature should be added with extra is that there should be A timer becoz sometimes some important works comes in middle of the time set by us .. If we just start a timer then exactly how much we work that can be recorded as we don't want tree dead ... This feat should be added additionally with the existing feature,poor
I got Pro version. App worked fine for 4 days. But now its crashing a lot. Again n again need to reinstall and there is no guarantee that i will Login in 1 try. You need to fix this,poor
App keeps on crashing while starting,poor
I had to uninstall this app as the app crashed a lot of times. I used it only once and then it abruptly stopped working.Could you please solve the issue.,poor
"Great app and concept... But please in the next update please add an option to PAUSE the timer. Also make it an option in settings, not in deep focus mode. Because there are some thoughts that need to be addressed for a few minutes and if not addressed can ruin all the session. It can also help in plant together because I have seen many people that gets an urgency but don't want to give up which breaks the loyality and ultimately breaks the purpose of planting together.",poor
The app keeps crashing.,poor
Worked well for 7 days then it keep shutting. I have pro version too.,poor
When installed the app works fine. But after a few days it does not work at all. The application just does not even open. And I can't even save my forest. It gets me demotivated to start again.,poor
"Great concept, but unfortunately have to uninstall as it's a data privacy risk. Our firewall detected (and blocked) hundreds of attempts to servers in China when the app was sitting open but idle. For its function, this app should be able to run locally without call outs unless there's an error state. Combine this with the permissions required, and it's too risky for my comfort. Hope to find a safer option elsewhere.",poor
There should have deep vibration mode after completion of 25 min...initial version had that setting...I am unable to notice the completion of task as it vibrate for a moment only..plz rectify it...Otherwise this is an excellent app!!,poor
Super,poor
"This is good, but i can't use in my phone for more than a day, Its not opening in my samsung note10 lite. Please suggest a way to rectify this issue.",poor
"The purpose of this app is great and is very affective till the time the app opens normally. However, every other day I have to reinstall this app as it stops working, which is very annoying. I might have to look for an alternate app. There are serious bugs issues for android which needs fixing!",poor
I just update this app & now app not responding 😥,poor
Edit to reply: You never used to need all these dodgy permissions. What changed? Why do you need to read my notifications now? Update: used to love this app. Now it needs a bunch of sketchy new permissions to do the same job it used to do: keep you from using your phone. So so disappointing as now I have to let the app read all my notifications (????) or it becomes useless.,poor
Crashing again,poor
can't open this app,poor
I have enough Google Play Credits for Pro Version but while making payment a lower amount is shown. What's the problem?,poor
"App is not even opening, wt is the point then",poor
"doesn't work anymore, I can not go to the store to purchase different tree species anymore, forest stops responding and I'm back on my home screen. I can't have any sounds and the coins I earn disappear ): I don't like it anymore. it's pointless, but these glitches have actually made me more desciplined, and I don't use my phone even without the fear of the plant dying. the app sucks and I can't care more about reaching out to the developers /:",poor
The app is not opening please fix it It was running smooth before.,poor
Its a good app. Its crashing on a daily basis,poor
"(pro user) I've been using this app for a long time and never had any problems with it but recently the app keeps crashing and even after re-installing it (works for a couple of minutes), it crashes again! The only way to actually use it is to use the forest extension on my laptop. This is getting really frustrating and I actually liked the app. Can you please fix this issue? Because it seems a lot of other people seems to be experiencing this.",poor
Nice,poor
"The app is good, but there are glitches. After some time when the person tries to open the app. It showed to clear the data of the app. This deletes all the storage of the app the coins collected, the forest made. This leads to the disruption of the person's analysis of their focussed work. Hope you'll soon rectify this error. And hope the soon comes early.",poor
App kept on crashing. I had to delete and download the app three times this week alone. I love the app. It has been very helpful. But this issue has been very annoying,poor
Very nice 👏,poor
"It requires some pretty intense permissions in order to provide the best experience. It may work for you, but it didn't really work well for me.",poor
"The app's good but after the update I'm having issues like the app's not recording the info after the completion of the timer, it just crashes and starts from the beginning.",poor
This app is still not responsinh in my phone it keeps on closing i have upated it for like a thousand time,poor
This app stops working everytime I install it. I have already taken its subscription but now everytime I open it crashes. I have reinstalled the app several times but the problem isn't solved.,poor
start crashing right after 2 days..but the idea is good,poor
It is very good but if i don't use it everyday than all my coins are gone and i have to replant it.,poor
"This is a good app.... but the only problem is I cant use it properly.... because if I have planted a tree and come back to plant another one.... or to use any option in the app, I cant do it. It shows that ""unfortunately forest has stopped "".... there is no problem with my phone.... please repair this problem.... I liked the app.... but this problem is just annoying me....",poor
"This app is wonderful but every time i click the store icon , the app stops suddenly If this issues is solved by developer I'll definitely give 5 stars",poor
The app was amazing but lately it's been crashing a lot and i had to uninstall and reinstall it and yet it keeps in crashing i lost my data and it's frustrating,poor
Everytime when i open this app it gets closed and says forest has unfortunately stopped. And two stars for i think this is the best productive app for studying and focusing,poor
"From the beginning of downloading this app everything was perfectly fine, I would have given it 5 stars about 2 weeks ago. Now I have given it 2 stars because as I try to open store and get new plants and trees the app crashes and closes so I am unable to get new plants. PLEASE FIX!",poor
After updating ..the app is crashing ..its not working,poor
"Well I saw a lot of people using this app, and base on they're ratings they say it's good but for me It's not, the app constantly crashes if I click some buttons inside the apps, It always crashes whenever I try or need to use it, Please fix it I really want to use this :<",poor
Not working great,poor
"Please check fast.. This app is not working properly.. When I open the Store for taking another tree, then the app exit.. I reinstall But again it shows the same problem...",poor
The App is crashing while unlocking new trees.. I am not able to Unlock New Trees though I have enough coins with me,poor
Worst ap,poor
"It was working fine until i had to install it again.Once i had installed it, it woukd come on as normal but then when i went in settings to put my premium in (Since i bought that) and then it just shut off abd said it wasnt responding no matter how much i tried even re-installing it..didnt work.",poor
"It is awesome app..but if it would contain the 'PAUSE' button..it would be more meaningful, as when one need to attend something in between the activity..he can't give up the tree. Moreover it leads to false analysis of focussed hours.",poor
"I hate when the sounds ads come out out of nowhere, eventho i close this app in the background",poor
"App was useful, but I was very disappointed when a large number of trees were moved to premium without warning. I had been saving up and watching extra ads for coins for weeks, and then found there was nothing I wanted to spend those coins on. It felt underhanded - I thought the deal was that I watch ads, app gets revenue, and I get a nice tree, but then that deal changed. If you're going to move features to premium it would be polite to warn users so they could spend saved coins first.",neutral
This app really helps me focus I can study with a go,neutral
"Love the app and all the trees, but 2 negative sides 1- the goal is to put aside the phone and so get a wonderful and lush full forest . So why is it that if a set a 120 min strike I got 4 trees but if a do 12 times a 10 min strikes, I got 12 trees... See the problem here?!?! To be less focus get me more reward. Not coherent 2- What's the Crystal ?? Really, even after buying the PRO Version I should pay real money to have these trees?!?! Not gonna happen and deceiving",neutral
Nice app,neutral
"No login option unless I repurchase, pressing restore keeps telling me there's an issue with my google account but I can't fix it by doing what it says. Can now try to login using reset password because the pop-up closes when I go off the app to see the email then brings me back to entering my email so I can't enter the code. Also had to delete and redownload in the first place because allowed apps doesn't update as I download new apps.",neutral
Can we have some more tags? I have a lot of subjects and I need to track how much time I spend for each. It would be nice if we had the option to customise our color tags. Thank you.,neutral
"I really loved this app at first, it's super helpful and I love watching the little trees growʕ ꈍᴥꈍʔ. Bit when the new update came out, almost all the time trees in the shop became available for premium users only :((. I've had this app for years now, but when this shift happened, I felt defeated. All the coins I've saved up we're pretty much useless after the update. Before I would have gave 5 stars but the new paywall really disappointed me and so many others.",neutral
"This app used to be very useful to help me stay focused on studying, but now that I'm graduated and busier, I don't always have control over how long I'll be able to do a task for. Sometimes things come up and I can't stop my timer without ruining my tree. It would be nice if I could set a stopwatch sometimes instead of a timer when I want to focus for as long as I can and cannot guarantee how long that will be.",neutral
A helpful app. Helping me focused in such a cute way,neutral
😎☺️😍♥,neutral
I used to love it but now almost everything requires pro mode :(,neutral
Thats a good app for students,neutral
It works good,neutral

"it's useful, but kinda sad that they have now made the cute trees a premium function :(",neutral
First i rated 5 star but there is a bug . If a remove it from background it does not work anymore. Fix it,neutral
"Great app but I think I may have found a problem. I don't know if this is phone-specific, but the app stops working when I clear all apps. The app seems to be working in the background but it doesn't forbid me from using other apps like it's supposed to. I request you to rectify this asap.",neutral
"Hi, I purchased the pro version of forest app on 22/10/20. Payment was successful and the amount of 180/- got debited from my account but then some error in the app happened.

After you change it to pro version I have no motivation to study because I dont have tree Iam a student and I can't buy pro version But I love your app very much before pro version Please return it to free version,neutral
Good app,neutral
"Nice app ,but does not suites me",neutral
"I absolutely love this app & would give it 5 stars if not for the glitch I keep encountering. I purchased elixir to increase the number of coins I earn & also have the ad booster on my pro account. If I use the ad booster with the elixir, the ad booster doubles the number of coins earned based on the original number earned without the elixir as opposed to the number earned with the elixir. This glitch makes it pointless to purchase the elixir as I would earn more coins with just the ad booster.",neutral
"i love this app and expect that i could have so many trees from the first day i install it. but this app always become not responding in the next day and it happened every day, so i must clear the data first and then use it again. so all my tree gone. :(",neutral
Great,neutral
Great app but can't restore my premium purchase :(,neutral

good,neutral
"i used to love this app until the most recent update. you have to unlock the 'pro' version to buy most of the trees, which is very disappointing. i used to motivate myself by collecting money and buying an amazing tree, but now you can only buy small plants with the free version.",neutral
"Disappointed when you change all beautiful plants to be available only after upgarding to pro version. It will only discourage people to download your app or even lose existing users. Suddenly it's pointless for non-pro users to save coins, the purpose of helping us focus would also be hindered.",neutral
I just downloaded it I don't know what it's experience,neutral
"I think it helps you stay focused but the app needs work. It has a lot of glitches. Emailed the devs even, but none of there tips have helped.",neutral
please add the widget because this app almost perfect!!!,neutral
"this is one of the apps that is WAY to confusion for me to use, it's nicely put together but it's confusing and hard for us dumber people to understand. it could use some work but it's okay..",neutral
Its a great app but the fact that you have to pay for a full experience sucks😔,neutral
"Got e new phone, can't log into my pro-account and can't restore purchase. Would have to buy it once again. Lost a lot of time with that instead of studying.... Otherwise nice app, like the idea and it is motivating",neutral
I just updated the app and I can't use it anymore cause it suddenly closes:(My android version is 8.where can I find the previous version to download? I'm sooo sad:(((,neutral
Good,neutral
Very good app for focused working.. the interface n graphic works are very good. No Alarm or Sound notification for session time completion.. that can be easily incorporated in the app but missed.,neutral
Nice,neutral
Great app. New update doesn't allow me to restore my pro status for some reason. Keeps saying I need to log out of other Google accounts but I only have my one Google account.,neutral
"I don't know who else has experienced this but since last 2 updates, when I receive invitations to plant trees togheter, I don't see anymore the type of the tree , and for how long they want to plant it togheter, it's always a 10 minute cedar, so only after I accept the invitation, I can see what tree they actually want to be planted.",neutral
I've only tried it for a few days but so far it's good,neutral
Good,neutral
Nice,neutral
its above average,neutral
"I hate the fact that not all the trees are of the free version. Not even a few new releases are in the free version. Please release a few trees for the free version also! Otherwise, it is an amazing app!",neutral
I'm quite dissapointed about the new update. I'm a Free user and I bought every Tree using my coins but when I updated it all the trees I spend were gone or it's only available in Pro. Since i can't afford the Pro I'm just dissapointed and sad that I can't unlock my trees unless I'm in Pro. I've been using this app and it was the best but now I'm rating it on 3 stars cause I can't unlock or use I spend in a year. Please help me get my trees back I'm sad right now ;-;,neutral
I don't like the new actualization that the app have. I can't buy any other tree unless I pay with real money. I don't know what is the point to earn coins if you can't use them.,neutral
It's a good app and was very helpful. However when the app updated it signed me put of my account and apparently I can't restore it. Would be helpful if you could fix this,neutral
Love the app but I can't sync my devices any more for some reason,neutral
"Nice app to stay away from phone, it will be more good if they provide free for like, to plant a real tree so that more people can plant the real one, especially for teenagers as they dont earn money..",neutral
"Now that you have to upgrade to a paid version to earn most items, there's a lot less motivation.",neutral
"It's a shame you force to buy nice trees for real money, it lowers the ambitious to use the app.",neutral
I think more trees should be added which are not included in pro version,neutral
Really helpful!!,neutral
"The app is giving good, but if i delete recent tab of this i can easly access any apps which aren't on white list without losing a tree. You need solve that problem. Omg how the hell i got this idea, now if i put on focus mode i use other apps by this trick, plz update.",neutral
worst app ever........ how can an app demand money for white listing....... i would suggest everyone to use yourhour app.,neutral
Good,neutral
"A ideia é boa, mas o fato de que TUDO que você faz precisa passar por uma tela de loading agonia bastante",neutral
Was nice but stopped working. Now I can leave the app and do whatever without the tree dying which defeats the purpose. I changed all my settings and even deleted and redownloaded the app.,neutral
Nice,neutral
Good,neutral
Happy,neutral
"It's all good and all but it doesn't help with productivity. Plus, without premium, a lot of the features cannot be used which is a sad thing for a broke student like me. For me, it's overhyped.",neutral

I love this app but I have one problem the app doesn't allow me to sign up - shows error has occurred. Help me fix the problem please,neutral
This app is amazing....,neutral
after the upgradation the plant is often become wither automatically; why?,neutral
There's no alarm whatsoever to notify me when the time's over. Please help me out.,neutral
"How can I not have an alert alarm when I start to grow trees? It beeps loudly regardless of the sound setting of my phone. Whether it's muted or vibrating mode, it beeps!",neutral
"Updated review: This was a 4-5 star app, then they broke the app, but have mostly fixed it now. I preferred the original app functionality. This version doesn't work for devices that don't allow certain permission. It also doesn't work for anything that autoplays. If I click on a youtube notification, it will play and I can listen even though I can't interact and my vision is obscured by the overlay. This does make the app less effective for me because my brain is a jerk and a dopamine fiend.",neutral
App size is too big,neutral
"Great for focussing, it's a shame about the latest changes to the free version",neutral
"Love this app, Pro Version is definitely worth it. However... my referral code would NOT pull up, and I missed an oppurtunity to refer someone. Adding friends and creating a ""Room"" together is way too difficult, and I would also like to see the option to delete tags. Rather difficult to navigate app regarding all these things, but I am hopeful to see what modifications are brought forward.",neutral
"I really love this app, it's calm and adorable in a way other focus apps aren't. But the paywall most of the trees have been put behind now just makes me sad. If you care about planting fun trees be prepared to pay.",neutral
"Thank you so much for the app! I have a great difficulty on focusing to do stuff and this app helps me with it and even let's you choose the kind of cute plant you re going to plant, thats what motivates me the most! BUT now with the new update i can only chose what?? 6 types of plants???? You just took the most motivacional part of your app, and I even spend the whole year to get a new one in my birthday....do you guys think even about people who won't spend $50 on a fake tree??? Congrats...",neutral
"Very useful in my studies. But i cant hear the 'time' s up' notif sound(alarm) whenever Im done with my time.. I usually ended up doing my stuff overtime because I cant hear the sound that its already time to end.. Also if i set time 1 hour continuously, i can only plant 2 trees.. But if i set time only 10 mins i can plant around 4-5 trees per hour.. It doesnt make sense.. But overall Thank u for this app..",neutral
"I paid for it and I like the features except the fact that after using a while in a cellphone, when I installed the app in my new phone the tags haven't had the same renamed names as I've done before. - Awesome way of focusing on activities with gamification.",neutral
"I really enjoyed the app before the update. It was motivating to see different trees at one place. After the update, I can't buy the trees that I previously could:(",neutral
"it's alright, it sucks that many things need to be bought. otherwise its awesome",neutral
"i really love this app and it motivates me to study,&i was really excited to use the cute app & the pretty cute trees,but after i earned enough coins i found out that so many trees can only be bought if i had the premium version.i was also upset when i found out that only a couple of trees could be bought without premium. a student without a credit card & my parents refusing to pay for it,i was really bummed & upset.i would have given five stars in the past when there was no premium version.",neutral
"I loooove this app but after the update half of the trees were only for premium members , I get you need a way to get money but really the only reason I was using the app was to get cool trees. This made me kinda less motivated after the update ....",neutral
Nice app but free users have only limited features,neutral
اون قسمت با دوستان باز نمیشه,neutral
"Muito bom! Mas falta uns ajustes, como sincronizar os contatos com o celular, Instagram ou Facebook. Depois da última atualização, ficou com um design muito bom.

I love this app and use it all the time. However the selection of trees are now unfortunately limited due to a recent update :( I was lucky enough to get some trees before the update however the way it was before used to motivate me to continue studying,neutral
How disappointing that most trees are now exclusive! The version before the update suited most people as I can see. 5 stars going 3,neutral
I really like this app it got me off of my phone in class time until my tree had grown I got sooo much work done.,neutral

"I loved this app a lot. However, after a recent update, I got very little trees that I could buy. I am not a pro version user and when I saved enough coins to buy a tree, I updated the app before I bought the tree. It was to my greatest disappointment that the tree I wanted to get was now the pro version and I could not buy it. Can you add more varieties of trees for the non pro version? I feel that the previous version was better. Thank you",neutral
"Me pareció buena idea la app, pero al entrar en la parte superior en ""plant mode"" que te da dos opciones no puedo seleccionar ninguna, ayuda por favor",neutral
"I really love this app. It helps me so much to focus on my work, and seeing how my forest looks after some hours of deep focus is really motivating, despite that, I unfortunately have been having some issues with the app. I use the whitelist and I've noticed that when I'm planting my tree, I can access not only the whitelisted apps but all of the apps in my device. This is a real bummer and a hope you guys fix that, please! Nevertheless is an awesome app and I cannot recommend it enough!",neutral
Used this on iPhone it was amazing however it doesn't get the data from iOS to android which is a problem.,neutral
"App molto comoda e semplice. Peccato che dopo l'ultimo aggiornamento gli acquisti possibili senza la versione pro sono diventati veramente pochi, rendendo l'uso dell'app poco stimolante.",neutral

However, I purchased the Premium version and have been unable to restore said purchase after resetting my phone. The app is good but this is frustrating.

En general la app esta muy bien pero depronto me dejo de funcionar y no importaba cuantas veces la instalara me aparecia lo mismo😐,neutral
no bad,neutral
This is so good app but after completing the time duretion of studying there is no alarm clock and every things are good actually excellent.,neutral
Hey Forest Team! Seen your progress grow over the years loving the new favorites and tags interface! What would make it better is allowing multitag selections! This is one pomodoro app that doesnt have breaks. Pls add a break timer after each sess. Would be nice under your new UI! No trees would be selected or planted of course! Customized break times can also be added to favs! Thanks & lots of love,neutral

"Things you can do for free is becoming more and more limited. Most of the trees are exclusive for the paid version. You can't use combination without the paid version. Most of the updates are only for the pro version and some features previously free now must be paid for. The free version used to be good too but now get ready to spend some money.

"I like the overall idea behind the app, but I think that it's becoming more of a distraction, than helping me stay focused. 1) I'd prefer to set pomodoro sessions with breaks between them, rather than having to do that manually everytime. 2) Also, I don't understand why there is not an alarm after each study session and I have to check when the time is over. 3) I don't like the way focus mode is designed. I'd prefer to not receive notifications from the apps, rather being unable to use them.",neutral
sometimes it does not shows when break is over.Its only when i open forest it shows break is over.,neutral
There's no more option for double coins after the last update. How do i bring it back? Since the trees became so much expensive,neutral
"Used to be the best app for staying focused...but bcoz of the new update maximum number of the species are are now only available for the pro version, and the normal users are only left with the species costing 300 (which are only 8 plus three free ones) ...and I'm also facing a lot of crashes, I have to reinstall it but the same thing happens after a few months...pls fix this problem",neutral
All the trees open only after taking premium 😑,neutral
"I love this app the only thing I would change is the idea of logging in with premium, I got a new phone and can't go back to the moment where I had so many trees planted all my trees are gone 😭😭😭",neutral
Very nice app. Helps me keep focused,neutral
Free and great,neutral
Hey this app is so very usefull.But the only thing it is lack of a music after the completion of each slots,neutral
"Idk if it's my phone or this app, but I can't get it to work properly ever since I got a new phone. The allow apps feature should only allow a few apps to be used but when that's turned on I can access all apps regardless of the list making it pretty useless. I allowed everything for this app in my phone's settings but still no change. Disappointing since I used to love this app.",neutral
"No, I don't want to try SleepTown. Yes, I'm sure I don't want to try SleepTown town. Yes, I'm absolutely sure I don't want to try SleepTown. Please stop asking that often. Thanks.",neutral
"I love this app, but since the last update I can't open the store to unlock new trees, for the love of mother earth please fix this, I need more cute trees aaa",neutral
"Not able to restore purchase, keep saying I need to log out other account, but I only had the exact account on my device, I contacted Dev they said could be my google play store problem but I also tested on other devices (can't restore) and contacted Google, which google says is the app sides problem, still waiting to fix this, I purchased the pro version just few days ago",neutral
I dont like the new update,neutral
"limited amount of motivation amd support , i'd personally prefer for it to have a pomodoro timer too...",neutral
"All is great, but I don't get notifications when time out. How I can fix it?",neutral
It was a great app. I loved use it while I studied and in return I got to earn coins to get new plants. Now most of the plants are pro only and I hate it.,neutral
"Helped to focus. Very useful app. But, what now every time i update the app, it stops working, and i have to uninstall the app and re-install, so that i lose the progress i made till then. Very sad!!! But, the heart breaking part is that, almost all the lovely plants became available only in the pro version, many of them already unlocked before.",neutral
it really helped me to get out of my addictions and live a days to its fullest. But ads are the main ⚠️ problem,neutral
"I recently unlocked the pro version but I have experienced a lot of difficulties: 1. There is no sound notification even I followed all steps 2. I added the plant reminder but still there was no notification. I hope you find solutions for these things. I really love this app, yet due to the troubles that is why I gave 3 stars. Waiting for the new update and I will change my rating if the problems are resolved.",neutral
After completion of planting time it doesn't plays sounds notification. And because of this time exceeds in one task more than one and causes mismanagement! Kindly fix it!,neutral
It doesn't let you take a break when you finish your study sessions. I love the app and I've been using it for a long time but the last weeks it doesn't work correctly. I'll come back to it when the issue is fixed.,neutral
"If only I still had access to my old trees, not needing to purchase the Pro version I would be so grateful. Nevertheless, great app.",neutral
"Used to love it but all the trees are now Paid version-only. That really sucks, I barely have the motivation to collect more points. Might just uninstall.",neutral
Can't buy the pro version. I love this app tho,neutral
"I'm giving this app 3 stars right off the bat because of ad walls, but heres why. I understand that app developers need to make money somehow, but there are multiple ways to do it and this is not the right choice for an app about PRODUCTIVITY. Productivity is about managing your TIME. When your developer makes you sit and watch an ad its a waste. It is immediately sending the message that they do not care about your time, and therefore they dont care about your productivity. Just your money.",neutral
"Fun, challenging, frustrating at times without premium",good
I have one question how to use sunshine?,good
"This app has been helpful to me in focusing. I wish it has a ""break mode"". Nevertheless, I am happy with the app and I look forward to my Forest.",good
Please add more trees! baobab is amazing! Great incentive for funny trees,good
Is a great app to focus on doing your homework or the work you need to do:),good
I really like it but there are some things that I need to pay for them..,good
I like this app so far it seems cool🙂,good
The App is very good But i want to add a ring when the time finished It will be an excellent app when this Future in it,good
Really cute app and I love it. But I wish there was a feature where you can pause the timer? Take a short break then resume studying. It'll be really nice. edit: still nice but its boring now not gonna lie. And I find it so unfair that we have to pay again? For a more exquisite tree when we already did? My motivation just drops-,good
I can't pay for the premium version.,good
"Having less screen time now, but I hope that instead of just having virtual trees, real trees were planted everytime we have reach a certain time for not opening our phones. 😄",good
"Really cute way to help you tackle the negative effects of smartphones on your attention span, still testing...",good
App is good working but I can't get notifications when time is over. I hope to that's just a little problem.,good
They asked me to rate them,good
Good app,good
Aplicativo top. Abraços,good
Is a greap app to stop looking at the phone every 5 sec and getting distracted,good
I hope this gives more opportunities for people without pro version as mostly students are using and we can't really afford to pay.....Overall I love this apps and helps me so much :)))),good
This has been really helpful for me to be more productive. I wish that there were one or two more trees available at the start as this would motivate me more to make my forest look different and I'd spend more time earning more coins. Its a slight incentive but it would work for me. I like the fact that I get the redirect message if I happen to tap on an app that I shouldnt be using.,good
The App is good but uninstalling coz almost many things are premium. That irritates me,good
Постоянно что-то всплывает и деревьев мало,good
"I absolutely love this!! I love using the deep focus mode often & it keeps me from getting distracted. I love the concept of growing your own forest—it feels like a game & that's really lovely! I like all the ASMRs. They put me in a study mode and is really useful. Edit: removing a star bc I dislike the new update. Edit2: after reading the replies, I've understood. Still feel like it's a dirty move. At least make new trees available for us for a day or smth & then lock it for premium.",good
I like the app I can manage my time more but I'm confused why it's not ringing when the work is done,good
Nice app to keep focused but the premium it's ok but the app soo good,good
Overall nice app but it shows a update notification every time I open the app which sucks but apart from that very nice app for measuring productivity.,good
Best but paid.,good
I love it but would it be possible to have a pause button in case the user diverts herself from the task by reason of bathroom breaks or any other just cause? I love it though. Thank you!,good
Nice app 👍 for students,good
🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤗😶😌😉🙃😑😤😶😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘,good
"Not yet used this time, let's see if i can avoid making the exception list to long",good
Good app!,good
Referal system is a little wonky but its great for studying,good
Awesome app to focus in study,good
Help you to foucs and also activate the reward system in your brain.,good
an alarm would be a perfect addition.,good
Very nice nice but..............,good
"Hi forest team, I do love your apps so much and it is able to help me focus on study. I just bought the premium version fews day ago. However, currently I am facing problem in sync the old phone forest data into the new phone. The new phone showed need to pay only can log in. Can your team assist me on it ?",good
Great app. Fun to use. Would have given it 5 stars if you could take 5 min break on the same plant then continue growing it I like working with the pomodoro method,good
Интересное приложение,good
"Hi ! Wonderful app. Works great , does its job well ... It's simple and easy to use . On recommendation... Please add timetables to keep track and set how we want to spend our time ... Otherwise , SUPERB .",good
👌👌👌👌,good
I have premium but thought it would be better if there are more trees available. Since players are able to build their own biome eg. Desert. That would add more fun to the app.,good
"The app is great, but how do I get my account with Pro version back? It says there is some kind of an error and I need to log out of all the accounts except for the one I bought the pro version with, I did so and it didn't work.",good
The problem with this is that when my phone screen is off it doesn't give a notification that the tree is planted. Even though do not disturb is off and silent mode is off and the notification are on. Please fix this,good
Good for studying and doing revision,good
"The features were great that's why i upgraded to premium immediately. However, whenever my time is up,the app does not notify. Hopefully my concern will be solved",good
This is a very nice app but some free features are kind of limited to use until you get the premium features. But i still use it though.,good
Is it a Chinese or Taiwanese Official app ? Ans me,good
I love the app but I personally would love it if I could plant trees with the coins I made. Since I have forest I am a lot more concentrated.,good
"Love the app, it kinda sucks that they moved so much stuff from the free version the the premium version but the premium isn't really expensive so it's ok. The only thing I'm sad about is that the new trees that have been added recently don't change over time. Whether you plant it for half an hour or two hours, it'll end up looking the same. And that sucks cuz letting my tree be more beautiful if I plant one for longer is a motivation factor for me. So I'd like to see that change :)",good
Good,good
"Great app; I wish plants and sounds were cheaper. Basically, you get coins for planting trees and you can use them to buy other types of trees and different background sounds.",good
"I really love this app, it helps me focus. I recommend it",good
Honestly this is super helpful. Little sad half of the tree choices are only available if paid for. But the rest of it works really well.,good
"Useful, aesthetically pleasing and great motive to be productive #plantatree!",good
Very nice app.,good
"Love the app. The paid version is 100% worth it. The only thing missing is nested tags. I'd like to be able to tag a tree as ""Study > Econ 101"" for example.",good
"This app is so good, but premium is very is not very good as before it was released lots of the now premium trees where not originally paid for so i think that there should be no premium.",good
It's a very useful app for the people who wants to concentrate for a big amount of time without checking their phones. I'm a student and I use this app every time that I do my assignments for the day because it helps me to stay focused on what I'm doing.,good
Good app to focus,good
I wanna get allow list but can't buy pro version in our country,good
"I love this app and use it religiously while studying, it is a life saver. I use the app along side the desktop chrome extension and I tend to start both timers at the same time, this messes with my stats and the length of time I have ""stayed focus"" is doubled. I wish there was a way you could chose to limit multiple devices at one time. now I don't know how feasible it is, but it would be really helpful and really add to the experience of using the app!!",good
So good,good
I like trees,good
I think this app is very useful because when I didn't have this app my little brother can't finish his homework on time but when I setted 30 minutes for the forest my little brother already finished five homework in 30 minutes.,good
"It is actually really nice and good at keeping me productive, it's a shame we miss out on so many features by not having premium",good
Amazing tool for studying,good
Good,good
Good,good
very cute and helpful app:)) I just wish we had more plants haha,good
It needs a lot of buying which disallows us to use basic features. Majority of users are students so it isn't convenient for them to spend money on it.,good
Its a great app to focus and check progress...,good
Its a goof app but it wont let me tern on deep focus mode pleas fix it and ill give a five star,good
"Good app.. Helps me focus on the things that I need to do first.. Too bad you have to pay for it.. But its unleashing my ""green thumb"" 👍🏼😊💚",good
"it's a good app. it does help me focus, but not all the time. i still get distracted, but that is mostly my fault. however, i wish that forest would notify me while staying on focus to make sure im still doing it.",good
Nice app and very helpful,good
"Very good app I enjoyed using it, I hope ut has more expanded time and theme",good
"This app really made me look forward to studying and is helpful cause it gives you breaks as well as different options instead of studying like sleep, meditation and a lot more",good
Help to stop getting distracted by phone,good
not bad,good
Wow a nice app east to use and I get a lot of fun,good
Very interesting to keep people focus and see the amount of progress they are making in there life,good
most trees are premium now sigh,good
Good app. Liked it .Helps to remain focused,good
Great 👌,good
Please add a stopwatch timer that is my only wish!!!!,good
Helped me to be productive.,good
This little app has been great at keeping me focused while at work. Set a time goal and pick the plant you want to add to your forest and then get to work or study :),good
It's hard to pay in China mainland,good
Good positive reward n feedback system based app for focused stay,good
Great!,good
เป็นแอปที่ดีเหมาะกับการฝึกให้ตังเองโฟกัสกับการอ่านการเรียนการทำงานได้ดีเลยค่ะ แต่ข้อเสียคือถ้าอยากมีแอคเคาท์ จะต้องเสียเงินเท่านั้นอ่ะ ซึ่งมันแย่มาก เราแค่อยากมีแอคเคาท์ ไว้เก็บต้นไม้ของเราเฉยๆ ถ้าอยากได้ออปชั่นอะไรเพิ่มเราก็คงจะซื้อทีหลังมั้ยอ่ะ ทำไมต้องให้เสียเงินสมัครเป็นพรีเมี่ยมถึงจะมีแอคเคาท์,good
"I was liking it a lot,but when the new update came,I am unable to choose any type of Tree and I don't like that😣😣😣😣😣😠😠😠😠😡😡😡 PLZ fix the bug🤕🤕😿😿😿😾😳😳",good
This app is good thank you,good
Many stupid annoying bugs!,good
Love it,good
"For whatever stupid reason, it works, and it's adorable while it's at it. Don't let your trees die! I want the ability to add multiple tags to a tree though. Sometimes I want that 2hr tree but will be doing more than one type of task",good
"The app is great, but there some glitches and ways to access other apps, also there should be an option for creating a list of apps that you want open during the session, like calculator or any other useful, or the other person wants to use.",good
"Very effective app ,I love it 😍",good
"Great! Wish you'd release more trees though more often, love the artwork!",good
"It's okay but all of the cool are for the pro version. I am not going to pay to study,but it's ok.",good
Good,good
Very nice and calming.,good
Helps me with paying attention to my work,good
It only give me 10 mins option. That's it,good
"I love the app. It really helps me focus on my work and organize the recorded hours for study, work, rest, etc. I only wish that they put a break time when we study because if I pause it either kills my plant or I have to restart planting again. I always study +2 hours but I like to take breaks each hour. Also, the plants you get are VERY limited. I had this app for 2 years and they used to not charge you ($$ not coins) to plant cool plants, but now they do. Other than that, it's a great app.",good
Has really helped me stayed motivated and focused on the task at hand. I can set specific tasks to what I'm doing and timers to go along with them. Then to make it fun I can change the type of thing I'm growing. Really good for youth all the way to professionals,good
"Great app, very helpful and really cute interface. I just want it to go with deep focus mode without asking for so much of permissions. Otherwise it's really great app",good
"I wish I could do 4.5 stars because the only thing I don't like is that most of the trees, sounds, etc. are only for premium users. I read your replies to others and I respect the reasons, but it is a little annoying.",good
"I write this after the first use and yes! I will be using this for studying, cleaning and what ever else I need to focus on. I love the art and simplicity of this app. The unlock of different trees makes this into a little game as a side bonus. If I try to roam into different apps on my phone it will tell me to get back to business. *they took away the unlock trees* Paying for the nice looking trees is something I won't do. Not happening but the app still works well and does as stated above.",good
good and very focused app.. to make up everything,good
I love this app so much it really helps a lot whenever I study. But I hope you could give more features for free?. 🥺👉👈 It's a great app.,good
"4/5 , it deserves a 5, since it really helps with staying focus for a period of time, yet I would suggest to somehow overlay a social place in order to focus together with friends, and that if you paid for the app(which I did gladly), get more currency ingame. Kinda sucks to pay for premium and still need to grind for new trees. At least open a few more for premium users so they would be more motivated to unlock more trees.",good
It has been fixed! Thanks <3,good
"This is very good app but I have to get premium get access to work essential apps, overall very good",good
"The app keeps on crashing everyday I open it , even after I got a pro account . This feels really irritating . Edit(15-10-2020): The problem was successfully resolved by the team . And apart from that , the app runs smooth , and is highly helpful and fun .",good
overall experience with this app is good ..its cute ...works great,good
I love it 😍,good
Need alarm,good
A handy task timer.,good
Good,good
"This app is great all in all. It helps me focus and reminds me to have breaks (which I usually forget). It's sort of a mini study assistant. On the down side, if you don't have the pro-version, you miss out on alot of things. For example, you can't actually plant real trees without the pro which was the main reason I choose this app. Im not a fan of buying things in apps like these so I was pretty bummed.",good
"Helps me focus when I study, sometimes I just like to look at my phone some video of some sort and study but forest allows me to hear nature sounds and help me focus",good
You will waste your time anyways its just this app will keep you aware how much your phone using hinders your productivity,good
This app has helped me a lot,good
It helps but you have to focus yourself tho,good
I loved it.,good
Nice all,good
This is a very nice app. I loved it. But I am not able to open other spieces of trees. It says upgrade to Pro version...instead you can show some ads instead of paying for it...if this issue is cleared ... I'll change the rating to 5.... It's a request..please look in to it.,good
Nice 👍 one,good
"Its okay. I unlocked a tree, it took my coins, but when I went to plant the tree it said I needed to unlock it (all my coins were still gone)",good
It is a very good app,good
There are still several bug even I get pro,good
"The app is great. But since I use it primarily on my tablet, having landscape mode will be very appreciated. Hope this feature will be added in the near future!",good
Good,good
"Awesome app! Helps keep me focused, the friends feature keeps me accountable, and it let's you track your time to really measure your productivity. Only flaw is that we can't use phone and computer at the same time without duplicating results. I get distracted by both computer and phone apps. I also think we should be able to see the trends of our sessions on the PC. The tree store should also be accessible on PC. Otherwise, highly recommend.",good
Really enjoy using this app. The only problem for me is that it doesn't tell you when the time ends so I continue doing what I'm doing until I realize it's time to stop.,good
Good app for focus,good
Useful app help in increase productivity......,good
Add public rooms. Where we can catch up with people preparing fr same exam.,good
Great app.. Makes study more fun,good
"It's a wonderful app , this app keeps me away from phone and makes me study well, I planted one tree and next I was curious to grow trees and make big forest, overall I was happy with this app",good
Helped a lot!!,good
Free version lacks any motivation to actually get off your phone since the tree grows no matter what app you're on,good
Nyc,good
"Helps with focus, but menus are not intuitive.",good
Great,good
"Okay so I've actually had this app for a good eternity. However, I never used it because I'm rarely productive. Since I've been more busy and I need to focus my time on certain aspects, I'm starting to use this app more and more. The only reason why its not five stars is because I WANT MORE SOUNDS!!!! Otherwise, its perfect.",good
This app is so amazing. Before I was not doing study but when I downloaded this app I started studying. It is very helpfull for me. I would request that you should make more apps like the forest app.,good
Good☺,good
It is a good app,good
Great!,good
Gd app,good
Very good graphics!,good
I love this app is so cute and also help me but some i have to pay,good
It's a good app,good
"Absolutely love the app. The graphics are marvelous. However, the only tweak that should be made in my opinion is for the timer to be atleast 3 hours longer.I understand people could take advantage of that, because some could do it while sleeping. But with the pandemic, 5 hours would be nice maybe 7 for people doing school. The phone for me has been extremely distracting for me . This app helps me heavily but when the timer is only 2 hours MAX. I inevitably take advantage of this. Distraction😩",good
Amazing,good
Nice app.Do check out. All the best.,good
"This app is very good, the only problem: I was on Deep Focus mode, with the music turned on, I was cleaning all thr apps to not get distracted and accidentally deleted Forest. Now the music won't stop! The timer has already finished and I cant use my phone, there is a RAINFOREST song on the phone. I would like some help.",good
Very productive,good
In statistics I cannot see how many hours I have spent on each tag which is really frustrating. It only shows percentage. It will be really helpful if you add that feature in future.,good
Great ! Error 600 trying to invite friends tho..,good
I really love this app and my friends and I have created a remote study group using it. One suggestion I have is I wish my friends could join into my group study session at any time after they've been invited and just plant a tree for how long the rest of the session lasts. If I am using deep focus I can't communicate with my group about setting up another study session and at what time. It'd be nice if they could just join for the remaining time.,good
"4 estrelas porque o app é ótimo para ajudar a manter o foco, e tem uma iniciativa positiva com relação ao plantio de árvores, porém eu tava juntando moedinha pra comprar a love tree e logo quando eu consegui ela virou exclusiva 😭😭😭😭",good
Love the idea of this app!,good
Good,good
Amazing app,good
"There are stuff to buy with true money like more plants , backround sonds etc. It should have been better if these things were free",good
Time limit is maximum 180 min ki. B hOni chahye!,good
Love this app,good
Good app butif we want to plant tree,good
Good to use,good
The app is great.,good
I love this app. It provides me a method to avoid distraction. But ever since they locked most of the plants with a paywall I don't know about that. Now I can't buy the plants that I want without paying.But I understand they had to do this at some point ☹️☹️.,good
"n tive paciência então desinstalei, mas é um game legal",good
Loving the app🌻,good
Deleted old tags show up again when installing app on another device. Also my timer doesn't start automatically in plant together mode and I can quit even when room owner started the timer. It takes 10-20s to sync the countdown timer.,good
"It s a nice app. Keeps you focused. But i have a suggestion: It would be nice to make the forest ground different like with snow, with rain, etc. And as well it would be cool to be able to rearrange the trees how you like them to be. Please try making this happen ^^",good
Great productivity app!,good
Original,good
"I had pro version already so I didn't lose access with the update but its a crappy move to lock everything behind a paywall. They still make money off most of us because the ads after every tree for doubling coins. I make a lot of small trees too because its easy, small goals make for l u s h forests. The time crystal currency that lets users get missed event trees for a couple dollars is a good idea though. They can make their money and people who had a hiatus or started late arent left out.",good
If i purchase pro version on my one phone and after a month i changed my mobile so after that can i use my previous pro version in new mobile,good
Good,good
هايل بصح خصرتوها كي درتو التسجيل بالدراهم,good
The limited no of trees in the new update upsets me :(,good
Liked it... But would have been better if it had more of a game like feel. I mean... If we did not use for like 40 min. May be there could be a bird. If we did not use it for another 40 min. May be she could lay an egg.. In another 40 min.. That egg may hatch... Like that.. It's just an example.,good
Its a very productive appp .i really love it tqu,good
This ap is very important app for student... And topper student... Thanks❤,good
Good for keeping track of your time.,good
good in maintaining my study focus,good
Great visual to keep you motivated.,good
"Best productivity app, my only suggestion would be to allow syncing between ios and android once you've purchased it on either platform.",good
Amazing concept... Students must download this app if they are doing self study,good
We can easily close the recent apps and can use another applications in the deep focus mode.Please fix this issue.,good
"I feel bad if u were to leave the plant die, so this does help me focus so I could keep it alive.",good
"I dont always use it when im studying, bc i dont always need it, but if im having a hard time starting tasks or keeping track of the time its a great thing to kickstart getting some work done. I love looking at the little plants when im done!",good
It motivate us,good
I'm a premium user and I'll be very glad if you can persuade me to spend more time with the app.,good
"Very nice app. Helps me focus, and it has cute trees😊",good
I know this app from my sis. 11/10 would be focused again.,good
Productive app,good
I loved this app so much. Really useful and easy to use. 10/10 <3,good
I love it,good
Nice,good
Amazing app yo stay focused and relax too😜,good
Simple easy to use app. Has massively increased my productivity.,good
Nice,good
Its an amazing app to keep us away from distractions,good
This app is amazing. It definitely helps me focus on my work and get things done. If you get it I suggest buying premium cause it's a small price for a very great app. 10/10 recommend. I use this app everyday.,good
It is a really good application I really liked it. It helped me to increase productivity,good
Amzing app,good
Nice,good
Best.app.ever. really helps me.,good
Very useful app,good

"Just discovered this app thanks to other students, love the ""plant together"" mode!",good
Helps me focus on my work but the downside is whenever I close my phone it takes 10 to 15 minutes and shuts down maybe this is because of my phone or something but nonetheless I enjoyed using it.,good

This app helps me a lot ❤️🤧😊,good
"This app does exactly what it says! It has beautiful plants such as star coral and flowered bushes. The sounds are very relaxing and I like that you can set the time and reason you want to focus. Overall, very good app.",good
"I really like the app, and it's very very helpful for me. Especially the plant together feature. It's the only app I have purchased the premium version so far. The only thing I would like to have and I don't is to be able to change the forest's floor, sometimes the green doesn't match the theme of my forest, but that's really me being nitpicky. Great app!",good
"This app is great for staying away from your phone when studying, sleeping, or simply relaxing. It is great for practicing mindfulness.",good
This helps me get so much done! I would definately recommend getting this app!,good
"I enjoy using this app, however the only concern I have is when I grow trees with friends, I am unable to see the duration of time. It would be lovely to be able to see it. Also a suggestion, perhaps add a new feature where we can customise our own tree and have it named. That would be so cute haha.",good
Great app!,good
I love this app the trees are absolutely lovely and the restrictive mode really helps me even with the free version it's so effecient i should use it more often,good

"Purchsses HabitBull now Habit Tracker.. years ago...found the receipt and emailed them several times....no answer. I tried writing a review, no answer... I tried Google searches for head office...no word from them , so now I make a tradition to warn everyone against paying for this....besides there's a FREE app thats just as good called Loop habit tracker. Try that first.",poor
Notifications and reminders don't work at all. Defeats the purpose.,poor
SATURDAY Please Make Saturday as an option in the days week starts with I'm a premium user and there should be a response to my suggestions by at least replying my email,poor
"Drinking water task only let me respond once, then stopped reminding me. I'll go thirsty with this app",poor
stupid app with adds,poor
i sent them email for help regarding premium purchase and they never responced...it has been months or more.,poor
Previously I use to get those quotes and will be able to get reminder with sound. But now nothing is working. So disappointed 😞,poor
I'm sure it's a fine app but I can't create an account or login with social.... Unusable,poor
"Wouldn't let me register, said no Internet connection when on WiFi and 4G",poor
Bad vvvvvv bad,poor
"I rarely rate, but this app is ridiculous. It's half broken, with terrible old design, very little functionality and the developer is charging £4.50 a month! While there is so much better app in every possible way and completely free without adds. Just uninstall this rubbish and try Loop Habit Tracker ;)",poor
"I've bought the app in long 2018. And since that time I haven't used it. Decided to return back, and discovered that my ` HabitBull Premium + Extras` is nothing. No visible way to restore premium Wasted 5$",poor
"Very bad, I purchased it and I couldn't registered or sign up to be a member. It keep getting error. Already email to teh developer and no one response... Sad",poor
I bought the premium version back in 2016. I wanted to start using this again. Its been many days now and I have not heard anything about getting premium back.,poor
Don't start,poor
My rating reflects how well this app fits my needs... not how well the app works ...,poor
"Last update ruined notifications! (Pixel 4a, Android 10) I no longer receive daily reminders (which I loved) and I no longer get an inspirational photo, only a blank white space.😟 I love this app and it's truly helped me. Please fix these issues so I can change my review back to 5 stars!!!",poor
"Can't even create an account. I tried several times to open the app and start using it, but it says I don't have internet connection. My internet is fine, the app is not.",poor
It was a meh app. Good for a while and then the server crash. I cant even login anymore. I already purchased the premium version but cannot use it anymore. So sad to say this but i really regreted buying the premium version. Bye dev.,poor
Causes my phone to consistently crash anytime I try to log in.,poor
It doesn't allow me to log in even though I type correct email and password,poor
"Notification Bar is to small. The notification that I receive after setting up everything (including but not limited to alarm sounds) is very small - just a 0.01x0.01 png image of a bull and the app defaut alarm sound - but there is not any visual effects [I have the volume turned up, and I went into the system settings to make sure that the app sound overrides the system to pop up on the screen] and I was wanting the display to illuminate over the whole screen and/or open the app up.",poor
Only 5 give at least 10 habits for free,poor
Login with Facebook doesn't work and neither does registering with an email.,poor
Notifications don't work,poor
App crashes upon logging in to facebook.,poor
Unresponsive widget,poor
There is no a daily checklist where i can see what is remaining for today,poor
App is good enough ; but hanging / not working / making bad your phone ; Don't download it ; it will make your phone worst situation 😔😔👎👎👎👎,poor
"I added an ad blocker, and now my habits won't activate reminders. I paid for this app, I shouldn't have to allow special ad access.",poor
It said hello super(wo)man which was pretty annoying. Uninstalled.,poor
Can't use the app because it won't let me in! Keeps telling me to login but nothing happens!,poor
Can't even sign in. Error notif says I have no internet connection.,poor
Suddenly stopped giving any notifications. Without these the app just isn't useful at all.,poor
eh pretty good but i dont like it 😞,poor
8/8/20 Update: Signed in 3 devices. Added 7 habits. No sync on any of devices. FAIL. Original post 7/31/19: I bought Premium in 2016. Worked great. Was a 5★ app. Recently had to uninstall/reinstall and now won't sync.,poor
"Sync not working, cannot export content and widget is malfunctioning.",poor
why do email ID and password Aap email id qu magate ho eese aapako kayaa 👎👎,poor
"Do not use this app, lost all my data (something like 3 years) go ahead and read other have the same problems, I even have premium. Now its impossible to login back with FB or email. Really, really disapointed. Developers dont answer any emails.",poor
"None of the reminders work, notifications turned, only when do I open the app do I get reminded of my activities",poor
The notification and alarm functions don't work.,poor
"Very frustrated with this app. Was using it to track goals, paid for it so I could save data in preparation for switching. Setup new phone, try to login and FB login no longer works and email not recognized. Great app, not worth paying for at all.",poor
Just 5 habits free !!!!!!,poor
"Worst app,, Now I just know that only 5 habit can track freely , there above premium, also payble Back up, But Developer are never inform first.....",poor
No longer reminds me to do stuff. Looking for another app now.,poor
"There is a big banner of a cat and a dog with sime motivational lines on the home page. Also, i can't set up reminder every 2 days although i can set up a habit every two days.",poor
limited number of habits only 5,poor
"[Privacy] Don't install this app. I purchased pro version [IAP] of this app in 2017. In 2018 dev mysteriously resets my account and when I contacted him, he gave me a password in plain text. So, he has my email address and password. I hope you understand that he has my data. I would urge you to switch to any open source app. Please care for your privacy.",poor
App keeps crashing,poor
The widget doesn't work properly. It only works when i open the app first and then go to widget again. Kindly fix this,poor
"I purchased the premium app back in 2014, and now that I am trying to use it again it won't recognize me as a premium user. I've contacted support and they have never responded any on my tickets. Poor customer service. I want a refund, or my premium account.",poor
Does not allow tracking of more than 5 habits without upgrading. Unable to remove or hide features that are of no use to me. Do not recommend. Waste of time.,poor
Worst App. Requires premium membership to sync data even after signing up with Email. What's the use of signing up with Email if you cannot sync the data. It's just a calender without premium membership. Better to use default inbuilt calender app to track your progress than using this application. I've lost all my progress that I've been tracking from 300 days. Shittiest app ever.,poor
Can only track 5 habits at a time,poor
Really liked the app and have been using premium but now I want to transfer to a new device. I can only doing this by signing up but whenever I go to the sign up section and type my email and password nothing happens and it asks me to sign up again. Really frustrating. If you guys can solve this it will definitely be 5 stars.,poor
Limited free goals.,poor
"This app seemed to have all the features I wanted, but the sync did not work after I paid $10 for the sync feature. I emailed their support with no reply. Very bad customer service.",poor
"You cannot add more than 5 goals in basic, and the premium is expensive",poor
U bought the app but can't reach my premium account,poor
Limited to 5 habits in the free trial. Waste of time. This is not a useful free trial for me. I have 7 things I'm tracking,poor
I have tried a lot to set up reminder..but unfortunately it's not working which is pretty excruciating as a new user. It seems good initially but this is pissing me off. Do ler me know I can fix up this ..,poor
Force closing on Android 10,poor
Haven't been able to get a reply from customer support since August 2019 - if you can't get your email registered you can't use this across multiple devices. Super disappointed.,poor
I've been using this since 2015.now with new phone. It didn't sync and expect me to upgrade again. Fix it please. Else. It will remain at 1 star. My feedback 👆🏼 posted few weeks ago was ignored. Uninstall for good!,poor
Was really enjoying the app but now the widgets stopped working.,poor
Only 5 habits,poor
"I bought the premium access and then when i change my phone, i never could get access to the premium version again... I wrote them an email 2 month ago and i havent received answers yet.",poor
DON'T PAY FOR THIS APP IT'S OUTDATED AND NOT SUPPORTED BY DEVELOPPER ANYMORE.,poor
Last updated 2018 really!!!! I am a premium user and it crashes sometimes. Bad investment.,poor
"After purchase, sync is not working. Then y sholud I purchase this app. Profile name is empty, while editing it says ""something went wrong"". And app is completely crash now. Not at all opening.",poor
Only 5 habits. If you dont want to pay it's not worth having.,poor
"Couldnt create an account, wouldnt let me past the setting up account page",poor
Such a bad experience. I bought the app and now it says they can't find my email id in their database. I am trying to reach them for 4 days. No response. just automated mails. so pathetic.,poor
"Many bugs: - Some deleted habits appears suddenly, combine with current ones - Some habits: successful days not linked each other. (I'm a premium user)",poor
"Confusing. Used to be better long time ago, not anymore. Confusing usability.",poor
Stupid app,poor
It doesn't work or show any reminders whatsoever and no picturea as it says. I wasted my money,poor
Sync problem is a deal-breaker. All that info is now lost. I used it for over a year. :(,poor
For anyone who wants to use this app: Devs stopped updating this in 2018. So they won't reply to your queries and/or issues. Look elsewhere...,poor
I'm unsatisfied with this application Not show negative feedback so it can't best app,poor
Twice lost all data b/c wouldn't sync. Had over a year of data. Had premium and still didn't make a difference. Moving on. Just done. So upset!,poor
"I love the app, but it won't sync.",poor
The Premium version of the App does not sync across multiple devices. I use an android phone and a chromebook and it still does not work. Don't bother with Premium.,poor
I have an error that makes me unable to sync due to a connection error though clearly I am connected to the internet. I am a premium user. The app is great but please help me with my problem. I'm tired of taking screenshots of all my pages every week as my remedy for the sync error.,poor
"I just bought premium and realized I made a mistake right away! It told me to register to sync my data and I did. Sync option wouldn't do anything. I wasn't able to set a username because of some unknown error all the time. Then half the screen was empty and I decided it was a glitch and reinstalled it and now ALL MY DATA IS GONE! So stupid! I just paid 10 bucks to be able to create more than 5 habits and I lost everything! Don't recommend this app, so disappointed...",poor
Guess I can't use this app after paying for premium 😧,poor
"Update 2020: sadly they didn't reach out to me despite me paying for premium version. Lost my account and no means of logging back in. Otherwise, the app is good especially the UI. Like this app but until recently I had to change phones and the database could not locate my email and the app changed names and logo so it's all confusing. If you could help me locate my account as I bought the premium version but couldnt log in to my account. Please help because I want to use this great app!",poor
"App was good in past but not anymore, it has stopped sync and many bugs creeped in due to no maintenance and update since. As per details in app Page, last update was on 28th Jun 2018, but still it is the first thing that comes in results when I search for ""Habit"" 😲 I guess Google should stop advertising an app that is not managed since years.",poor
"Used to be good, now support is gone and can't sync devices anymore. Pity",poor
"The app itself is great. I used it quite regularly a few years back but when I tried to use it again it seems that the 'new' owners don't acknowledge their 'lifetime' subscription. Sure hope my emails get more results besides ... /ignore kthnxbye Sent an email ... they said they opened a ticket and then ... crickets. Nice .. thanks, downgraded to",poor
Not updated anymore. Unstable,poor
"Don't buy the premium version of this app. Synching doesn't work. Stick with the free version, which would be 4 stars",poor
NOBODY USE THIS APP. Read all the forums. The app does not support the sync once you've bought premium. Everyone's saying the same. And the devs DO NOT RESPOND TO HELP REQUESTS. I have an error that makes me unable to sync due to a connection error though clearly I am connected to the internet. I am a premium user. The app is great but please help me with my problem. I'm tired of taking screenshots of all my pages every week as my remedy for the sync error.,poor
Ugly ui jiss. Fb login dosent work.,poor
I bought the Premium version and it will not sync. I have snet numerous requests to support and have received no responses,poor
"Used to be awesome, now I can't sync, log out or save changes made to habits. The quotes is stuck on same one. I have changed passwords, uninstalled and reinstalled, emailed your company and all but deleted app as it no longer keeps record. Please resolve .",poor
Spamming me to rate. Well here you go....,poor
"Update: dropped 5 star rating to 1star. App will not sync. I have it on Android and iPad,and neither one of them will sync to the server. App store shows 8 months since any updates. Would not have paid for premium if I knew it wasn't going to be maintained. Original review: I wanted to make something like this myself, but they've already done a great job. I feel more obligated to the daily habits I'm trying to build, and it's great that it tracks my completion streaks.",poor
App crashes,poor
This app lost all my data. I would sync every day but when I had to reinstall and tried to sync-nothing. I had paid the money for premium but now it wants me to pay again.,poor
"The idea behind the app is good. Although, after paying for premium, the promised cloud sync does not work (several users mention the same issue). There is no way of backup the data either. I cannot see any feedback from devs here. Switched to a different app: ""Habits.""",poor
"If it's a passion project I'd be willing to support the creator, but this seems to now be held by just a shell holding.",poor
Premium does not work. False advertising!,poor
"Find a new app. Overall if you havent noticed, the dev's left this app. As of recently, the servers are dead. This means you cant make an account, forums are gone, motivation pictures gone, etc. Find a new app,",poor
How do i get a refund?,poor
I was enjoying this app and decided to buy the premium features. But they took the money and provided nothing at all. I tries contacting the developer via Email and no answer at all. Stay Away.,poor
"I have been using the app from the last 3 years. I am a premium user. When trying to sign in a new device and sync, it's not syncing. I need my data. please help with this issue. Even after reaching to the support team tonnes of times no one is responding. So i am changing the rating from 3 to 1.",poor
Vorrei avere indietro i miei soldi visto che il login non funziona e che non sembra esistere un'assistenza tecnica. I want my money back since I cannot login,poor
"Don't install this app.This is forgery. I've used this app for more than 2 years when I changed my mobile phone I couldn't login when I logged in it says ""this email account is not in our database"" I have the mail to prove that I had had the account in the App.I mailed the company 4-5 times but there's no reply. 2 years of my habit data is lost.",poor
"Decent, but premium features like Sync do not work, can't even reimport data you exported yourself. Had I realized this I would have never have bought the app, it's just false advertising. I now have to figure out how to port my data to another app where it won't be inevitably lost.",poor
"Do not pay for the app. Sync doesn't work , they dont support the app but they are always ready to take your money.",poor
After installing this app my phone received an increased amount of spam calls. After removing the app from my phone I received fewer spam calls. It might be a coincidence... But it might not be.,poor
"*Update* 11/02/20 USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! As expected, no contact from developers. App has not been updated since 2018. This app was great for a month until it kept freezing my phone. A de/reinstall has now lost all my data and looking at other users with this issue, it looks like it is lost forever because of the sync function never working and no contact from developers. Very upset and disappointed.",poor
"The app itself gets the job done, but it will not sync and the developer is not responsive to questions. Don't waste your money with premium. You won't get what you pay for.",poor
"I paid for habitbull premium for the sync functionality, which fully does not work. I've tried reinstalling the app, reinstalling android, getting a new phone. No luck. Emailed habitbull a month ago and still no reply. If I want to take a backup I have to screenshot everything. not ideal Apart from this the app is decent. It's got a cute meme",poor
"stealing in 2020: make an app, call it HabitBull, make people buy it, remove it from playstore, republish the same app with a different name.",poor
Paid for premium. Sync does not work. Publisher does not reply. Started reading reviews and found numerous people with the same problem. Going to try to get my money back. Nice app if you don't care about backups or syncing between devices or customer support. Switched to Goalify and finding them extremely responsive,poor
"Updating my previous review. I recently hit the two year mark on one of my habits, yet the app only shows me of having 30 days. This is the same bug I reported last year. It appears that it does not recognize some of my habits over the New Year. I've reported this problem four times now and have never heard back from anyone. I'm giving up on this app, and suggest you do too. ""I've used this for a couple of years. There was a bug where one week of my tracking wasn't recognized by the app. This happened the week of New Years. I reached out to the developer five times about it and never heard back. Unfortunately, this has become an unreliable app for tracking.""",poor
This app doesnt sync data.,poor
"The widget and sync functions does not work on premium. I get the widget error telling me to log in but I already have and even reinstalled the app. Nothing works. Developer, please fix this.",poor
"No further improvement. UI is kinda suck, there are many better alternatives",poor
"This was a great app but it hasn't been updated since 2018 and sadly it be can become unusable in an instant with no fixes in sight. I cannot recommend this app. I would try something similar maybe open sources, or with dev support",poor
"Paid for premium so I could sync between devices, but it doesn't work and customer service will not respond to my inquiries.",poor
"Paid premium, it doesn't sync at all. Costumer service unresponsive for a long time. Don't spend money on Premium, this app is dead, the last update was in 2018",poor
"Good app, but no updates even after sending few suggestions. What is the point in buying Paid version.",poor
Sync not working. Don't buy in-app purchase.,poor
Paid for premium. Does not sync.,poor
Failed to connect to Facebook,poor
Facebook login fails with an error from Facebook saying the login method hasn't bee implemented correctly.,poor
Lost all my data when I moved to ios,poor
Hyper masculine tone is very off-putting and irritating. Hint to developers: Women try to change habits too! At least give us the option of just having hints in our own words...,poor
"Paid for the premium app last year, now there is no history of my email address ever being registered despite me having the confirmation emails from them when I first paid for it. Lots of complaints on here. Get one of the open source habit trackers & back it up yourself to cloud storage rather than spending money with devs who change the app name slightly & try to charge again. Seen this happen so many times.",poor
"Does not sync across my devices, which it claimed it does. Only reason I purchased. Looking for my refund.",poor
It's working anymore after paying for premium,poor
Does not log in. After 5 minites it's still trying to log itself in.,poor
"Had accumulated 5 habits that lasted 17 days and counting (now using a different app.) This pathetic app that I paid premium for, would not sync. ""Check internet connection"" every damn time. I paid for the damn app, sadly probably past my refund day!",poor
"Unsupported. Doesnt contain sync feature. Wouldn't issue refund. To the makers and google, get on your hands and knees and repent to g*d",poor
"Why are you counting inactive habits for the 5 habits total? It's ridiculous! There are many other apps that don't have this silly, cash grabbing limit.",poor
Online sync is no longer working and last update was June 2018 which is more than a year. Is there a reason why I should continue using this app?,poor
"ABSOLUTELY DO NOT UPGRADE TO PREMIUM. It does not work. It does not sync. The developer does not respond. Google Play will not give a refund. The frees app is flexible. You can track yes/no and count per day habits. The count per day can be any criterion you want, minutes, calories, quantity.",poor
"""High background usage"" Sorry, can't waste my battery spyware like this",poor
"Very bad premium services, developers are not taking care of this app anymore",poor
Please ADD REMINDER 😭 or show me how to sett,poor
Lies! No multi-device syncing on premium,poor
"Abandoned by the devs - hasn't been updated in over a year. Sync doesn't work at all, which was its main advantage over rival apps. Don't waste your time.",poor
Premium subscription for such a simple app is greedy.,poor
"Expensive, old and without any support. Also much better alternatives are available now.",poor
"I like the app, but I don't like rating apps, and this one constantly nags you to do so with no option for it to stop. Even with the paid version, so 1 star for being annoying after I've given them my money",poor
Files Lost Forver. No updates and broken,poor
awsome application.. i purched it.. but i just want notifation should be blinking on phone like alram clock .. plz add this type of features.. the thing diplys in notifaction should be flash on main screen From last 10 month it's not getting synchronising.. Plz do something @developer We paid for it,poor
"Very expensive for a simple app, and quite useless without buying the premium. Only tracks 5 habits? Lame. I can't believe this is the app advertised in the play store, and still has a high rating because it is garbage. Sounds like even if I bought premium it would be worthless for transferring data to a new phone as the app claims, I won't even risk it.",poor
"Broken! So far, not impressed. I bought this expecting multi-device sync and haven't seen it do that. It wouldn't even restore a backed up file after logging off then on.",poor
"Developer is non-responsive. For some reason when downloading the app from the play store it associates with the incorrect Google account. I have verified I am downloading the app with my intended account, however it continually associates with the wrong account. It's not really a big deal, but I was planning to upgrade to premium with my play store credits. The account this app associates to does not have any.",poor
"App hasnt synced in 190 days. Won't let me log out. Still loads all my old data from last sync. Hasnt been updated since 2018, that should be the best clue. Dont buy!!",poor
"I loved this app. I've been using it for years. Today I have updated it and mh2 premium account just vanished! Now it prompts me to buy Premium again. What happened? Could you help me please? After a few years and after the second time paying for a premium membership and after no one reacted to my complaint, my premium membership and all my data vanished again without any backup as promised. This happens everytime I buy a new phone. Very dissapointing. I will not fur sure buy a third premium!",poor
Only 5 habits,poor
"No longer syncs, no longer supported, so no longer installed on my phone. Was a good app. Shame :-(",poor
Can't sign up with email!!,poor
Will not let me register. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Tried both the email login and the Facebook login.,poor
Need more habit columns for free,poor
No longer syncs.,poor
"The last update was more than a year ago and things started to stop working. The company that owns it seems to be a scam. It was a great app, I paid for it and got no support",poor
Sync not working anymore,poor
"If you pay for premium, you won't actually get the premium services (as other reviewers have noted). Troubleshooting steps from their site don't work, and no one responds to the support email. Contact Google and they'll reject your refund request.",poor
"App no longer supported, data loss likely: Was a great app until I needed to migrate to a new phone. The sync feature never worked, and I lost months of habit data. I tried contacting the developer via the supplied email, but zero response. I used to recommend this app to many people, but I'm done with it.",poor
I have paid for the premium features but the sync is not working. I mailed them but got no response,poor
The app hasn't synced for nearly 9 months despite being a premium user. The support team haven't acknowledged my email. It's a good concept but they've failed to make it work and don't provide customer support. Check other reviews. Go to play.google.store on a web browser. Select My Account and go to order history. Select the ... and it offers you an option to request a refund. That should get the developer to either repair it or take off the premium services it is falsely selling.,poor
Only 5 habit you can update,poor
Very poor customer support despite being a paid subscriber. Strongly recommend against this app. Not able to sync across devices and there was no response despite sending mails.,poor
Sync isn't working. No response to emails. No updates for ages.,poor
It's been 1 week since I'm using the app. The reminder system worked fine for 1day and from next day the reminder system stopped functioning. Really disappointed. May be uninstalling the app after few days. Hope this helps.,poor
"I bought premium and now I can't login to the app using Facebook. (and I can't login any other way) I get this message: ""Login Failed: You can't use Facebook to log into this app or website because there's an issue with its implementation of Facebook Login.""",poor
"Gives a cheap buy once option for Android users but for Apple users a more expensive yearly subscription price, which is very discriminatory.",poor
"An app absolutely focused on my needs... that has broken. The sync function broke down about 3 or 4 months ago, it can export its data to .csv but not import it.",poor
"Sync doesn't work. Paid for premium, had to get a new phone and it won't transfer. As other reviews say, it seems this app has been abandoned. Unfortunate because I liked it.",poor
Like another commenter said. Just installed it on new phone and even though signed in it doesn't give my my paid for premium. Previous phone checked the sync and last sync was 128 days ago.,poor
"Purchased the premium, the app stops sending notifications after some days, I have to repeatedly open the app to get notifications, waste of money",poor
"Sync DOES NOT work! I've tried multiple times to get it to work and my internet connection is just fine. Had to switch phones when my old phone died and can't get my old data back on the app because sync doesn't work. Also no way to import data. Great app if the feature worked or could import data, but rendered useless because of this. So if I switch phones or have to reset to factory standards, I lose everything. Paid quite a bit for this app just for this feature alone, but it DOES NOT work.",poor
not free,poor
Sync doesn't work,poor
"Don't buy the primium subscription, the app does not sync as it says. Also, support never answer.",poor
"Do not buy premium! Devs are not responsive and there is no way to reach them should you have any issues. Contacted them several times to transfer purchase to new phone, nobody responded.10$ wasted.",poor
Takes ages to load each time I open it up. Used to be good. Time to say goodbye,poor
"Pathetic. I was totally in love with this app until I changed my phone. I lost the phone, and when I installed the app in my new phone, everything was gone. My habits, data for last one year, every damn thing. And I have purchased premium of the highest cost. There's no way to restore my data or contact the devs. If you cannot save on JSON file of mine in your cloud, please explain why I should buy premium? There is a sync option in the app. Don't tell me I should have manually ""synced"" my stuff",poor
"do not use this app for tracking your habit for long time, you'll lose your data if you do t pay the premium membership. I've lost 3 months of daily tracking data of my habits.",poor
"Purchased by premium, getting error can not sync. Emailed support, no response. Don't waste your time or money",poor
"DO NOT PURCHASE! The app works as it's supposed to, with exception for the added purchase features. I bought the app so it could sync up with multiple devices, that feature does not work despite following the FAQ as to why it might not work. I have tried their support ticket system which had an automated response, but they have yet to respond despite me trying multiple times to reach them and ask for assistance or a refund.",poor
Can't log in with Facebook.,poor
"The reminders don't work. No noise. No vibration. I even bought premium to see if that would help. No luck. If I wanted a place to just mark my progress, I'd keep an Excel spreadsheet.",poor
"I bought the premium version of this app and it doesn't work. The reminder does not function, which basically renders the app useless. I emailed the support team and I haven't gotten any response or acknowledgement of receipt. I want a refund. What a waste of my money",poor
"Needs to allow more habits in the free version, giving people time to use the app and consider upgrading.",poor
Reminder did not appear,poor
Unnecessary limiting of number of habits to be tracked. Use Habit loop app instead,poor
App is not supported anymore and syncing not working,poor
Reminder does not work,poor
Appears to be an abandoned app.,poor
"(UPDATE (October 2019): VERY DISSAPOINTING The SYN function is no longer working, which I found out while rying to transfer my history to a new phone. Some other reviews have noted that too. The export option also seems iffy (at least when I tried to e-mail the export, nothing happend). And I found no import! Since I paid for the app I would expect these to be available. Will change stars if resolved. It's dissapointing because this is one of the best habit tracking app, but the lack of sync and export/inport function is a deal breaker. ((UPDATE (March 2015): What happened to the option to switch between the weekly and monthly view?!! It was very useful.)) I tried a number of other apps for habit tracking and this one is the best so far. Very clean and easy to navigate interface, useful statistics and clear feedback on both the streak and the overall trend and percentage. I love the easy way to switch between weekly and monthly view. One suggestion would be to include a colored bar for each habit where the colors are based on the daily success and failures. I saw this in one of the better iphone habit apps. I actually used Habit Streak Pro for years and I did see HabitBul earlier, but the bull icon deterred me from trying it because I thought it looked really cheesy. The app behind this cheesy icon is actually the best of the habit trackers I have tried so far. Keep up the good job.",poor
Synchronisation is not working. It's dishonest to sell a service that doesn't exist 😬,poor
"It's not working properly, always fails to Remind, no more reminder notification, this feature suppose to work for free version, if the promise features in free version doesn't work how can I get confident to buy paid version , request team to fix this issue",poor
"2019/10/24 - revised from 5 to 1 star. App is dead. All my data gone. Never again trust an app you cannot export and organize your data, and to a universal format. Avoid as others said recently.",poor
No quotes,poor
"Widgets don't work unless you open the app, and sometimes you then you even have to take an action or two within the app. Wish this product was maintained. Have emailed the developer, but they didn't get back to me. The app doesn't even support logging out, anymore. The usual uninstall/reinstall didn't work.",poor
"I really like the app, but I wish that I could slowly increase my goals without losing my streak.",poor
The user interface is not user friendly No one likes to use a complicated app to build habits which will make their work even more harder Make it simple and easy to understand man,poor
It is difficult to understand,poor
The widgets do not work. Please add auto back and provide some analytics/graphs on the habits management and formation.,poor
Like many premium users I received an automated email letting me know that following a bug my password was reset. After that impossible to use the premium features any more. Developer doesn't respond. Such a shame!,poor
"I really like the app. I've even purchased the ad free version to support the developer. However, be advised - if you use the app and need to change your phone or reset it, your data will be lost and you will not have any support. After I factory reset my phone I don't have any of my previous habit data even though it's supposedly synced with my Google account. That's over 2 years of info that I lost. I've sent multiple emails to the developer and have not received any response since.",poor
"It seems like a good app but only offers 5 habits to track on the free version. I'll stick with it for now and see if it is helpful over the 66 recommended days, but might uninstall if I feel the need to monitor further habits.",poor
"Yo, fix the widget",poor
Reminders are not on time!,poor
"Like others have said in here, the widget freezes and then you have to delete it and re-add it to work again, even a phone reset won't get it going",poor
Won't allow me to register or make an account. Tried to set up without on to try it out but as soon as you lose the app the habits you have set up disappear! Not the best trial!,poor
"This app has not been functioning this week, it has not been reminding me on any of my habits... super frustrating!!! I loved this tracker and now I may have to look into another 😬 I've tried deleting, reseting, uninstalled and reinstalled, nothing. But if you remember on your own you can put it in and it'll keep track",poor
Reminders ain't working!,poor
A little too complicated and dictatorial (too many prompts). Plus only 5 habits allowed unless u buy the pro version! 7-10 habits and I may hv left it on my device and give it a proper run. Instead I decided to uninstall and download a simpler version which is more flexible and suitable to my needs.,poor
Free account limited to 5 habits,poor
"Reminders only pop up when I remember to open the app, which defeats the whole purpose. If the reminders popped up automatically at the set times, I'd give the app 5 stars.",poor
Complexity and unavailability of useful feature for free kill the interest. Atleast widget should be available for trials.,poor
"Advertises that you own your data and you can export your progress. In reality, they don't let you access that feature without a premium membership. I don't mind paying for features and services, but keeping your data behind a paywall is dirty. I'd recommend finding a FOSS habit tracker.",poor
"Very simple UI. Potentially too simple and plain but hard to tell without using it for extended period of time, some may like it scaled back look. Can only add 5 habits before having to pay a fee for premium. Hardly enough to actually truly test drive the app before paying. Seems costly for the simplicity of the app.",poor
Only the premium version is good for use free version is a waste of time,poor
Only 3 stars because after the first 5 options No more Then u have to pay,poor
Can login with facebook because there is an issue with login implementation. Uninstalling,poor
Reminders haven't been working.,poor
"I like this app, I bought the premium version last year and I still can't synchronize my data, I have to change my phone and I will lose all the data! Could you fix that?",poor
"Man, this app is great. Simple but complete, which makes it very effective. Customization options for habits are excellent and connecting to specific communities a huge plus. Highly recommended if you want to keep track of your progress towards a goal! Updated: logging features are still as good as ever, but since syncing is impossible, I can't see the forum anymore as my user doesn't properly log in and there is no customer service, I can't recommend it anymore...",poor
"I bought a premium subscription, but I can't get my devices syncing. I'm quite disappointed.",poor
Sync no longer working:(,poor
"Edit: Initially gave it 4.5 stars. The app itself still works fine, but the sync stopped working about a year ago. That's the main reason I paid for the premium version. I messaged the developer about it and never heard back. Wonder if it's been abandoned by the developer?",poor
"Seems like it could be very helpful. Getting very frustrated with it always opening on monthly view even though I have weekly view selected in settings. Even tried switching it, but no matter what opens on monthly",poor
"I liked it when I first got it several years ago. But after installing it on several devices, I found it does not sync with the other instances of it. After getting no response from their support desk, I uninstalled the three apps from the three devices and reinstalled them using my google account in case I had not logged in with the same account on all. The three new instantiations do not sync. The help desk is non-existent. The idea is good but the app is defective.",poor
"very simple app to track your progress towards acquiring a habit, the only downside is that you can't sync the app as it says ""no internet connection"" when there absolutely is. Also, together with this bug all forums are no longer available as well as daily quotes, it's just gone. Previous rating was 5 stars, but with this bug continuing for half a year now I can only give 2 stars.",poor
"Widget freezes, app does not sync. I had a galaxy S7 edge and just got an S10+. App fails with both phones. Regret spending money on this.",poor
Unable to import any data from the .csv file in cloud!!! No option to get any data back! Bought premium and im not happy. Beware!!!,poor
"Can't see new topics of discussion. Also can't add discussion topic even though I have excellent internet connection, Wi Fi or Data. Please fix. I have no connection issues with any of my other apps.",poor
Loading takes too long and reminders don't work.,poor
"Unable to log in, unable to create a new account or link to facebook",poor
The moderation of the discussion bards in the app leaves something to be desired. Needs better moderation.,poor
Sync no longer works. Also app has been buggy lately - closes down and does not respond. I'm now using Loop Habit Tracker which is more stable.,poor
"Hello Habitbull team, I need to check all features in premium version so can you give me access to premium version for 2 days so that I can try all features and check if the feature that I need is present or not and then buy premium version.",poor
"I've been using this app for more than 5 years, it was great. But currently I changed my phone and found out that syncing doesn't work anymore :( It says something like ""no internet connection"". So at the end I have to use another app.",poor
"I really like this app. Enough to purchase the premium a few years back, but the app didn't update to premium for me, and there was no response when I contacted the support. Seems like I'm not alone in this experience. Don't put your trust in the developers!",poor
Mixed great app but don't by premium. Won't work without play services and developer unresponsive,poor
EDIT/UPDATE - Purchased premium. Sync doesn't work. A quick glance at developers FB/Twitter accounts shows that they have basically dropped off the face of the Earth (no activity since 2018). App hasn't received an update since 2018. My suggestion: pick an app that's still actively developed. Exactly what I have been looking for. Fantastic interface and thoughtful design. I'm hooked guys!,poor
"Worked fine for months, now it doesn't track habits the way I set them. It treats every day as its own success or failure regardless of how I have set it up. Going to have to uninstall and find a new habit tracking app.",poor
The motivational messages are annoying. You can only track up to 5 habits in the free version but it is totally not worth paying for more. Good riddance. I suppo this kind of app is just not for me.,poor
"The tracker itself is not bad but I set up a notification to remind me to do something and am not getting them. I already checked my settings, all is good. It's nice if you remember to go in and mark done but notifications are not working.",poor
"Can't choose when to start. I like setting goals/habits for advance dates once I'm done with one+. Also, you can't edit a habit/goal to start over, you have to delete and start new. Doesn't save your previous habits/goals to do again.",poor
I liked the app until it told me I could only have 5 goals. :(,poor
"The *only* part of this app that doesn't impress me is the widgets, everything else is beautiful! Good visual layouts, simple quick tracking, but enough features to be flexible for different needs. UPDATE 12/30/2019: The app no longer syncs and does not import data. I've got a handy cvs export with 3,000+ lines of habit data, thank goodness, but can no longer reccomend the app if it requires manual input to restore data.",poor
"I had to buy this app because I need that larger widget to fit my needs, and you cannot test it out with the free version. Sadly, it's too buggy to be of any use, at least on the AIO Launcher. Still overall better than my last habits tracker, but I feel ripped off.",poor
"Customer support is completely unresponsive. I purchased the upgraded version and it doesn't sync as promised. There has been no help on FB, email, nada. Kinda sucks TBH. The app is nice. The Android widget is what makes it great. Plz fix the sync issue and I'll update my review if your customer support reaolves the matter and makes things right with me.",poor
Only 5 items on free version. Would be nice to have that clear so I don't have to waste my time and give out my email.,poor
Love and use the app BUT sync feature does not work and my attempts at eliciting support from customer service have gone unanswered which is disappointing.,poor
"Worked well for a few days and then just stopped sending reminders. The reminders would pop up if I opened the app myself but that's obviously not the point of a reminder. Also, froze a lot. Pretty much useless. When it worked, it was excellent.",poor
"Can't sync!! I paid to have the ability to make more tasks, but that's about all it's good for.",poor
"I really think the math is off on this. Logically it does NOT make sense that if you have a good day your percentage of success goes up by 1, but if you have a bad day it goes down 20%. That really defeats the point of motivation and self forgiveness.",poor
The app has stopped synching and cant get it working very frustrating. I paid for premium and no one replies to help resolve which is a real shame as the actual app when working is very good.,poor
"Used to be a great app, but I've moved phones, but the sync did not work and all tracking data has been lost. Even after having paid $18 for premium. Very much a shame.",poor
I was testing this to replace Fabulous. So far the notifications are not persistent enough. Fabulous is able to wake me up in the morning.,poor
DO NOT BUY PREMIUM Version!! App stopped synching 7/27/2019 and is no longer supported. I got Premium to sync to new phone since I've been using the app for over a year and wanted to keep tracking. $10 wasted! Very disappointing because basic version is great - simple but fully functional and effective for tracking up to 5 habits. Good visuals and the ability to make notes. Premium = tracking >5 habits and syncing across devices but no more! Would be 4 stars if still supported and worked.,poor
Having trouble syncing on new device; says there is no internet connection but my connection is strong.,poor
"While i can understand limiting somethings for premium only, i've never seen an app block widgets behind a pay wall and quite frankly this is only useful to me if I can keep track of things on the homescreen. Maybe I would have liked it but so far i havent used it because i keep forgetting its there.",poor
Too much fluff. Difficult to see the actual progress.,poor
I bought the premium. And I can't sync the data between my devices.,poor
"Syncing devices doesn't work, even after reading and applying suggestions in the FAQ of the website...",poor
"Good design, simple and clear but with the option to dig down for more details. However, they don't respond to emails and haven't released an update in over a year. Seems like this project was abandoned.",poor
I've set a reminder for me to drink water... It doesn't remind at all!!!,poor
"App hasn't been updated, can't sync, can't import habits, this was a good app, shame that I have to switch",poor
"Great app in the beginning. But once you start skipping days, the notifications become insulting shaming words. For example, calling me a couch potato. Which I am not. So dumb. What expert would ever say that insults are motivational? Almost none. I'd rather use an app based on the principle of kindness, not shaming.",poor
"The app is good to use overall. Except, as a number of other folks have said, it does not sync. And there is no response from the developer on this issue. Annoying to have paid for an app that claimed the sync feature, when it doesn't actually work. What that means is you lose all history every time you change the phone.",poor
"Really? $8 for a habit tracker? There are other apps that do the same thing for far less money. I don't mind paying for apps, but this seems like price gouging. Oh, and it's $10 if you want the ability to export your data!",poor
"It seems like this app is no longer supported. I've paid for premium, but sync stopped working several months ago, and developers have not replied to a support request. So - on moving to a new phone - my habits and streaks are now lost. I can see from other reviews that this is a widely reported issue. I guess the app has now been abandoned.",poor
"The app is constantly loading and you can't even record your habits, and reminders don't work also, having just 5 habits free is bad too.",poor
Paid widget feature!!!!! One thing that downplays all other.,poor
"I like how the app has options to write notes/journals for each day. It gives you the option to reflect on how you stuck to your habits. Most other apps don't have this feature. That said, I'm rating the app two stars because the notifications don't work for me. I have set times for reminders throughout the day, but the app sends me random notifications (reminders) when I don't want them. And on other days, no notifications at all. No app updates from the developer in over a year either.",poor
Does not sync,poor
worked okay for awhile. sync between devices no longer works and I have the paid for premium account. uninstalled on both devices. sync fails on both,poor
"I liked the app and I purchased it. But I can't sync any data from old phone. And when logged out of the app, there is no way to login again except reinstall the app. So if anyone is fine with restart all the progress everytime you change phone, this app is for you. But since I like to keep my progress to the new phone, I am stop using this app and find another one.",poor
No notification of Habit tracks,poor
"Good app but don't bother with premium. I bought premium for the ""powerful widgets"" and ability to track extra habits. Don't bother. The widgets are nothing special and if you read the tips section the developer even says it's best to only track a few habits at a time! After feeling ripped off I emailed the developer twice requesting a refund but have received no reply. Great free app but don't waste your money on premium.",poor
Desde hace unos meses no sirve la Sync ni me deja entrar a la cuenta,poor
"Generalle good and easy to use. Unfortunately the sync/backup feature seems to be broken so I can't transfer habits to a different device. The CSV export is also useless, as theres bo way to open it in a different device.",poor
Cannot sync. What is going on?,poor
The app doesn't really look like the screenshots. It's also quite outdated in design. If you don't mind paying for it then it gets the job done.,poor
"I'm changing the rating into two stars because the sync feature which previously work fine has no longer work. Looking at the last update I feel like the developer had abandoned this apps, which is quite sad considering this usef to be the best apps on building habit.",poor
"Slow updates, bugs",poor
please add a feature that make me add a friend to the habit such as habit competition app😥 i can't live without this feature,poor
not a bad app but DONT pay for the premium. The widgets dont work!!,poor
"App is very good for what it is, but the sync feature stopped working for me. The FAQ says it's due to a rooted phone but this happened twice on non-rooted phones. HabitBull offers no support to fix. 2 stars bec it works standalone, but if you need syncing know there's a risk of permanent failure.",poor
unable to register via manual and via fb,poor
"I like that it allows specific habits, I don't like that it does not give proper percentages of how much you've done your habits. after using it about a month i deleted it, because even though i was doing almost every habit 100%, it kept giving me <50%. it was demoralizing.",poor
A little too confusing.,poor
good,poor
the app requires premium membership to use the widget. defeats the point for me,poor
I m just very lazy enough to use this app plus this app is not based on concept of habit building.Let's see how habbit is built u do task u get reward but here for sake of reward u only get Dots connected in pattern that's not motivating instead u can give some offers as reward.,poor
"Worked really well, however the widgets work for a day then won't respond unless removed and re-added. . . Eevveerryy day. won't remember to actually use it without the widgets, so its useless now. not worth paying extra.",poor
couldn't login with Facebook,poor
It is completely failing on reminders!,poor
"I regret buying the premium version, a lot of money for only a minor update. I wish I could get a refund. Do not buy the premium version from the app, it doesn't worth your money",poor
"I upgraded to Pro after a couple of weeks & initially excited about the app. Having used it for a while now I'm starting to regret my purchase. There are some pros but more cons. It's buggy, doesn't sync well at all across devices, the UI is very cluttered, the forum needs serious updating, a search tool for eg. The last update was ages ago, given how pricey this is you'd think the developers would make it worth it but they seem to have disappeared!",poor
Please change the logo,poor
Terrible UI,poor
"i like this app but one thing that i hate , why do i have to be member of premiums ( i mean why do i have to pay ? ) if i want to track up more than 5 habit ? this is a free app right ? please can you consider or change something about it",poor
"This would be great if it didn't require me to mark negatives. in other words, it requires me to mark everyday I did NOT do something, such as smoke a cigarette or drink alcohol. This is overly cumbersome over time and is going to cause me to stop using the app because I don't want to have to check everything that DIDN'T happen. This could be much better if it assumes I didn't drink or smoke if I didn't make any mark for that day. Or at least give me the option to do it this way.",poor
"bought premium version, didn't get upgrade, sent proof of payment, still no response. not good",poor
the layout was good but it only lets you track 5 habits for free,poor
it's not worth the premium. I tried to get a refund because it wasn't what I thought it would be and no one has contacted me. They claim to read every single email but can't reply to a paid customer. I will be deleting this app and regretting the $8 purchase,poor
"well, It is good and motivational, but I don't get notifications for the reminder. Moreover, you have to pay for the widget",poor
There needs to be an option on when the habit starts,poor
Awesome tracker yet it seems overpriced in my country way more more than the typical range of $5 its about $10 for me with tax included. Also I don't appreciate the greyed out price being the same as the 33% claimed discounted price very deceiving. Lastly the lack of support for a fingerprint access method is subpart for 2019.,poor
Used to be my favorite app! Changed phones and it doesn't recognize my premium purchase. I've been emailing for support for two months with no response. So disappointed.,poor
"Too much configuration, not very intuitive, I'm looking for something simple that only counts something for the day, not to set goals, reminders, notes, and all that overload of information that keep jumping from screen to screen, not looking for enterprise app just for personal use.",poor
"I could not figure out how to set reminders. And I did NOT want to ""register""",poor
"Password reset is broken, cannot transfer it to a new cell phone. Think twice before buying this app. The habit-related side is good, however - this is why I bought it.",poor
"I love that you can chose x amount of days a week to complete a habit, other apps force you to commit to specific days, the flexibility in this app helps me succeed, what I hate about this app is it fails to get my habit completion-for example I did my workout for the day but still receive repeated notices to do said workout for that day. way to drain any joy out of an accomplishment habitbull!",poor
"free version is all you need, paid version is overpriced and a waste of google credits",poor
I love the ease of the application and the setup. I don't like that the way they send you reminders that are sometimes rude or shame-based. it doesn't make me want to try any harder when I get scolded for not fulfilling my goals. positive encouragement as the best way.,poor
I want to start my week with Saturday and it is not available! only can change between Sunday & Monday !,poor
useless! you need a premium account to use Widgets,poor
"I had my phone switched off one day at the time my reminder usually pops up. Ever since then I've not got notifications at all, no matter if I try reset them or whatever. Kinda annoying because the calendar app on my phone has also stopped giving notifications lately so I keep forgetting to take my medication.",poor
Started off really well but has stopped working properly now. Great shame as it has a lot of promise.,poor
Crashes on sign in on my Pixel 2 XL,poor
stuck on setting up your account,poor
"great app but waaay to complicated, deleted it and replaced with a different simpler app. interface looks cool though.",poor
Reminders are not working. I have an Asus ZenFone 4 (shouldn't matter) and I have set the reminders multiple times with no success. I feel this is the most important part of this app as I need reminding in order to affectively create a habit. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. My rating my change after feedback.,poor
"It's misleading to list data export as a reason to buy Premium, when it is not included with Premium. It would be great if you could change this to accurately describe your three tier pricing system. Additionally, the Platinum purchase option is currently showing me the full price even though it is advertising a 33% off. The greyed out full price is exactly the same as the 33% off price. Will give higher star review when these are fixed..",poor
"Too expensive and without paying, there's no backup. There's free apps that do the same thing.",poor
Two stars because facebook login is not fixed for an year. Is this application still supported by the dev team?,poor
"Widget Request: please could you add a feature that pushes undone tasks to the top of the widget? Or an option that removes done tasks from the widget.   Good job on the app otheriwise, I'll repurchase if you can add this, love the snooze function.",poor
"only a few habits for free, not worth paying for",poor
"Free version gives only 5 habits, there are far clearer and better trackers available for free.",poor
"Fine for tracking, but the reminders stop working after a couple of weeks (this has happened with every new habit I've set up, and I have a premium account) and the developer doesn't respond to support requests.",poor
I didn't like it.,poor
none of the notifications work. other people in the forums teport similar problems bht no fix. the app is nice but it isnt nearly as functional without notifications,poor
"I would not recommend this app bc of an essential flaw in design - it doesn't allow you to just type in habit, instead it quizzes you. So, a simple act of just typing what you'd like to do turns into this crazy and overly complicated thing.",poor
"Free version allows only up to 5 habits to be added, but app description doesn't mention it. Had to spend an hour setting up habits then uninstall the app and find a new one.",poor
I don't like the layout at all. I want it to be much more simple and quick to edit my daily tasks.,poor
"The motivation pics stopped at some level and dont want to be changed, pls solve this issue",poor
"The app is ok. However, I purchased the premium version and once I switched phones, could no longer get the premium version back. Emailed the developers for help and they ignored the emails.",poor
"I loved the app and purchased it to help my son keep up with studying. I paid for the premium account which indicates you can log in on multiple devices both iOS and Android. After setting it up on my phone, which was easy but took some time,when I tried logging onto my son's phone it didn't recognize the account. I contacted customer service but didn't hear back. It's a nice app, really like the features, so this was really disappointing. I could set it up again on his phone but without me being able to monitor on my phone it's not helpful. I still hope someone can help me fix this or I should get a refund for my purchase.",poor
Love the app. Would love a version for Windows/Chrome to use on PC. Also I bought a premium version and now when I opened the app after 4 months it has reset itself to the non-premium version.,poor
Paid for this years ago and used it on another device. Now I have a new phone and when I'm trying to login it says my email address is not in the database.,poor
It stops sending notifications randomly.,poor
"After changing my email, I cannot use HabitBull's premium features. I have tried emailing support--no response--and finding a way to restore the purchase or even purchase it again, but no such luck. I am forever stuck with the app thinking I have pro, even though I do not. It's a shame, really, for what is otherwise a fantastic app.",poor
Good concept with poor design. The widget needs a redesign - currently it wastes a lot of space on my homescreen. The forum section is good.,poor
"I buy the platinum app, but the reminders doesn't work!!! Please fix it! . It's a great app but the reminders are very important to me.",poor
I like the overall app. It is the best. But even after setting the reminder for my habits. I do not receive any notification or reminder. I have checked with my notification settings for this app and it is turned on.,poor
Please don't call me darling! My app reminder called me darling. Not cool!,poor
Works OK on Galaxy note 8 but constant crash notifications. Can't even log on to the tablet version let alone sync accounts. In the end all data lost and so am I.,poor
Free version only supports 5 habits which is basically nothing,poor
Only 5 free without telling users upfront that you will have to PAY for more. Always about the money. Sorry I wasted time on setting this up.,poor
"Almost 3 years ago I liked it enough to purchase it. Then they decided to make it a monthly fee. I found this out when I reloaded it onto my phone. I emailed them to find out if my previous purchase was valid or if it was applicable to the new version and they never responded. Even a simple ""no"" would have been fine. So, I found another habit tracker that I actually prefer.",poor
"Had annoyances with the UI, the font was too big for me and I couldn't see a lot of things at once. And for all its gimmicks, it's really just a simple app.",poor
Didn't like it,poor
Lost my premium and all my habits gone when I changed my device. The app was great but doesn't seem good for long term use.,poor
The fact that with the free version doesn't let someone track more than 5 habits it's a shame,poor
Worked for about a day and then just crashed repeatedly so have uninstalled. Disappointed as looked really good,poor
I think it's really petty that the widget only comes with a premium account. No thanks.,poor
I'd give it five stars but it keeps bugging me to rate it.,poor
"Pointless to be honest...may as well use a notebook. DOESN'T TRACK HABITS. 
Yes, you have to MANUALLY do everything...my time is to valuable to waste 
on this garbage.",poor
"Perfect. Purchased it. Though I really really wish for a chrome extension, 
so that I can access it on my computer too. EDIT: Like many others, my 
premium account is gone too. I don't mind purchasing it again but what if 
it goes missing again???",poor
"I would give 5. But the reminder is not working. And I wish the app had a 
way to report such bugs. Uninstalled",poor
"Sir , actually some time it doesn't pop reminder . I don't know why",poor
"I have purchased full version of this app. The functionality of the app is 
good but many features are not working properly. Eg. Starup on Montly view 
is not working. Additionally there is absolutely zero response from the 
developers on reporting the bugs",poor
"App was well organized and easy to use, but you had to pay money to have 
more than 5 habits to track. Not realistic for me to only need 5. 
Uninstalled it.",poor
"Please help me. I really like this app. But my premium purchase with my 
facebook account is gone. Recently I have trouble with the app. It stops 
everytime I opens. Then I uninstall, and reinstall it again. But it 
continues to stop. It turns out that the problem is I disabled Chrome. 
Because after I installed and update Chrome, the Habit Tracker worms again. 
However, my premium purchase is gone and I can't seem to redeem it.",poor
"This app is crashing whenever I try to mark as task completed on a 
particular date.",poor
Constantly tells me to provide a rating,poor
"Like the way it presents the stats. Would like to suggest a collaboration 
concept with other users (such as via Google) where one can view and 
comment his/her mate's lists.",poor
"App is great, but it crashes on month view and when trying to edit habit on 
my Xiaomi Redmi Note 4",poor
"like the app but dont like how I purchased premium on one device and can't 
get my premium features anywhere else",poor
Sync isn't working. Lost my data again....,poor
"Sorry for the poor rating but your app has a major bug. Swiping up or down 
while viewing details for a month/habit makes the interface jump to details 
for another habit randomly. It's a pain to realise midway that suddenly you 
are reading incorrect data. Happens so many times that it's not funny. Will 
be looking for alternatives to your app",poor
"Great design except they hide the fact you can track 5 on the free version 
until you go through the process of adding all five individually then you 
find out you can't add anymore without premiuthem, freemium is fine, hiding 
the cut off wall is not.",poor
"This is a great app. It gets two stars because I paid for it but it 
frequently nags me to review it. Well, here's your review.",poor
Cluttered and unintuitive.,poor
The app crashes and closes when trying to sync. I have the platinum plan,poor
"Has great potential but it kept crashing when I clicked the monthly view or 
the weekly view. Also reinstalled the app, and when I created my first 
habit it crashed again.",poor
"Too spammy. Repeated notifications pushing for a rating. I rated, then 
uninstalled.",poor
"I paid for this app yet it stopped working after I logged out one time. It 
refuses to let me back in when trying my password and even after I tried 
changing the password multiple times. There is no contact information on 
their website. :(",poor
"Habit sync does not work. I must create the same account over and over 
again. Frustrating.",poor
"Not interested in people's masterbation habits. The community news feed was 
full of people tracking their jerking off ... no thanks. Don't want to 
know. Uninstalled.",poor
Only track 5 habits for free!,poor
"Pretty nice app, but unstable a bit: sometimes drops settings like ""show 
monthly/weekly"". And a big trouble: Used it for 3 month. Had troubles with 
signing up at start and gave up - I used it without account just on one 
phone. About a week ago received strange email about password from support 
(they have my email but didn't sign me in?). Looked strange, frankly 
speaking, so I ignored the email and decided to try to register one more 
time. I used option ""sign up with facebook"", was glad to see title ""without 
data loss"" and when i finally registered... all my habits and data 
disappeared from interface. Sent email to support with screens and 
description, but silence still.",poor
"It's a good app but just list my premium account and all my data. Luckily I 
saved it. How do I get it back?",poor
"Great functionality, though app forces you to login, or create an account.",poor
"Good app if I could track more than just 5. If I want to track more,I have to pay for it... No thanks, not worth it.",poor
"Same as other recent posts.  Paid for premium, got a new phone,  it won't sync, wont recognize email,  won't accept user name and zero response from support,  I have emailed them 4 times and cannot get any response. Also the sync does not work",poor
The reminders never work.,poor
"It has all the features but it doesn't work properly. I have a 5 days 
streak and it says 7. I have 3 and ut counts as 0. There are major errors 
here and it's frustrating.",poor
Widgets require premium,poor
It doesn't let you have more than 5 habits without getting premium,poor
"They want $4.99 not just once for a program that is pretty much automated, but they want $4.99 A MONTH for something you could keep on Google Sheets or whatever else you could imagine, and It's cross-platform. Stupidly optimistic. No thanks.",poor
"I paid for premium some time ago. Just got a new phone and installed the app, and was unpleasantly surprised to find that my email address ""was not found in our database"". This apparently means that all my synced data, habits, and history are completely gone. I created a new profile with the same email address, but the app still does not appear to be syncing at all. I'll continue to use the app for now, as I still like it best out of all habit trackers, but be warned there is NO backup/sync support here.",poor
How can I delete my account? All I see is an option for deleting data,poor
"Worked until I upgraded to premium. Now I can't change my user name, can't write comments or add discussions. It's not syncing to my phone. Please fixs it's been less than 24hrs since I upgraded.",poor
Does not load,poor
Until recently I enjoyed the app but somehow my purchased Premium status is not recognized anymore. Contacted the developers by email but got no response. So sad :-(,poor
I bought the premium version and sometimes a habit won't chain-link between successful days. You have to delete and recreate it then it will chain-link between successful days again.,neutral
"Android widget not working. It shows the tasks but when I click on the ""circle"" to mark it as ""done"" nothing happens.",neutral
"I've had this app for a long time but only just started using it. It works well enough for what I need keeping track of the things I need to do. I think the free options are quite reasonable to, although as with most apps there is a paid option/version too.",neutral
"Its a great app, when the notifications work, but I'm still not getting notification reminders, so I'll be dropping stars on my review till this changes. I've checked my phone settings, but there's nothing blocking them. (My phone: samsung S20+)",neutral
Widget only for premium account,neutral
The motivational photo is missing,neutral
Whyd it log me out..... Edit: the push notifications dont push anymore,neutral
I love this app but the widget doesn't work most times which is very annoying,neutral
I dont know how its work. I wanna give it 5-stars but when alarm is once set and when it rangbit dosnt stop untill u switch off the phone.,neutral
"Hello, i can see that beneath by habits, there's supposed to be an image that never loads. I just see a white square with an image icon on top left corner. Can it be fixed?",neutral
"Nice visuals, but its not worth $5/month. I really wanted something for hydrating and this works but not inthe way I needed.",neutral
Decent app for habit tracking. Unsubscribing from their premium membership is a headache.,neutral
"Almost perfect! However! The widget bugs out and freezes as soon as you try to make the daily bigger than the far to small preset sizing. Also needs to allow for a one-off/to do list, similar to how Habitica has a dailies (habits) and then one off list",neutral
"Nice app... But need to fix some bugs.. First app crashes when I click on ""Go premium"". Also even if I am connected to wifi some big image is not loading on home screen. Wondering what's that image...",neutral
"It's good for what I needed. Simple. Good stats. Like the for color coding. Don't really need the chats on topics, I don't look at or use that. I wanted more than 5 items on my list and the widget for easy tracking on my home screen. The widget only works sporadically to check off an item, that's annoying considering I paid the one time fee. Apparently it's known issue, should've readmore reviews and maybe not purchased.",neutral
It is great for keeping track of my habits but I never get any reminders. I've checked my phone and all the permissions are there but still no reminders. I just get a tiny message that tells me the app is running but disappears without doing anything. I'll persevere a bit longer but if it doesn't remind me there isn't much point as I will forget to do things.,neutral
Too costly for premium,neutral
In theory it helps track habits but after 30 or 40 days the reminders stop appearing randomly then just disappear completely. Rest of the app works well. Perhaps its my device but be aware.,neutral
Not used,neutral
Super easy to use. Less friction. I like how users can discuss progress with each other. It's very helpful.,neutral
Looks like a powerful tool but the UI is a dealbreaker for me. Hopefully it receives a major redesign in the future.,neutral
"Over priced, under developed app. The free version only allows for tracking five habits and the premium version is about $5 a month. The app lacks the polish off others available for less and feels more like a beta than a final product. In the end, I found a better app that's completely free, has more features, and a cleaner UI. My advice to the developer is to ditch the subscription model (or make it less expensive and annual).",neutral
👌,neutral
"Without upgrading to premium, can only track up to 5 habits",neutral
"The widget stops responding. You have to open the app to make it respond again. Paid to have the widget, widget doesn't work. Read some reviews and see this is a known issue. Should have done my homework better.",neutral
Its okay. Premium version is more useful,neutral
It is a good app I've been using it for quite some time and I think I m progressing and this really is helping me. Just a bit dissapointed bcs it doesn't have a full progress tracker as a graph and I wish they will install this feature nearby in the future hopefully.,neutral
"Not great, but good enough to track habit and keep record. Read Atomic Habits to understand and learn the How, and use this App to keep track should yield a better result. Reminder not working...",neutral
It's about what I'd expect from a habit tracker. I chose this over another one for the motivational quotes. Only they just just up as the error picture icon without the actual picture. if I can't get the picture can I at least get alternative text for the picture that has the quote? Moto z2 force,neutral
I wish there are better graphs to see the dips and raises in my performance. The current one is way too compressed and looks just like a straight line inspite of the dips,neutral
The app is great now some bugs are fixed. Notification/reminders still don't work for me. $6.99/month seems steep to record more than 5 habits.,neutral
"No Resent Updates, Cloud Based & csv export is avaliable in only pro. No Option to Manually Mark Skip, Fail. But we can select targets like less than or greater than too. Can't Select date range in Graph/report. Local Data Import/Export is Missing. Habits can be archived, but Category/Group is Missing. Multi Device Sync is Avaliable. A very good alternative to HabitHub.",neutral
Good,neutral
I think I like it but not fully sure yet. Was getting daily notifications then they stopped and I forgot all about some habits. Will restart again.,neutral
The app design could be better,neutral
Great app . could you guys add a option like task archive because there are some habits like typing practice i want to follow and don't want to delete the data Give a option to hide the habit without losing data,neutral
"Good, but notifications not working.",neutral
I was unable to create checklists in the way I want. I'm better off using Microsoft Excel,neutral
"Works fine, free version a bit limited. Now notifications have stopped, hope the developers fix it soon.",neutral
Nice one but it's expensive,neutral
"I love this app, but my premium service doesn't seem to follow me. I sent multiple emails to get it resolved however I'm only getting autogenerated response emails.",neutral
Why is it called Habit Bull upon installation and it also has a different app icon? Misleading...,neutral
Good app but it doesn't have riminder as it says.,neutral
"The app wasn't able to sync anymore and as much as I know, the app wasn't supported by its developer. p.s. I bought its premium version; It was great, not until they haven't keep it updated.",neutral
Nice and easy way to keep track of your streaks and habits. Also pretty cool that there are comment boards so you can interact with people doing the same things. Nice to get encouragement and share tips. Really cool app overall.,neutral
"I cannot logout or change my password. What if I change my phone, then I wouldn't be able to load my data into the new one. Why is it that I cannot register my email?",neutral

Ok,neutral
"Everything is perfect, except for the fact that daily reminders on habit check feature doesn't work.",neutral
Not totally friendly environment,neutral
Pretty good app but the continuous nagging to rate it in the Play Store gets annoying in a hurry.,neutral
"Very good app for tracking habits and notes to add ,but lots of bugs to say.Percentage is not correct always,it calculates own and no sync, no UI improvement .thanks",neutral
I like the alerts .. it's a good free app.. I think it be nice if I could click the day then get an option for if I completed my task or not.,neutral
Still learning to use it,neutral
It's good! Easy to use.,neutral
"Paid for it, it's alright if you don't use the widget. Constantly freezes and needs refreshing.",neutral
"A great app. The one probpem it has is that if you missed a single day, you'll never get 100% no matter what. So it seems like if you missed one day although you continue the next day, all is fruitless. It's discouraging.",neutral
"it's a good experience and a great challenge as well , you should try it",neutral
Would need an UI refresh.,neutral
Wish I could track more than 5 habits without paying.,neutral
Great app,neutral
The app is good but the reminders for some of the habits are not working. I have bought the pro version.,neutral
"Great app! Just can't justify spending $8 - $10 in order to track more than 5 habits when there are other apps out there I don't need to pay for to do so. I'm switching to Loop Habit Tracker. Can track as many habits as I want and back everything up, all while being entirely free. Plus it's really nice!",neutral
"The concept has had an extremely positive effect on my life. However I am experiencing bugs with the widgets, where exercises are disappearing. Restarting hasn't helped.",neutral
"Could be a great app except that like another user said, it does not sync between devices when the description claims that it can. That's a big letdown for me because when used any other of my devices, and when I switched phones, I couldn't sync the app up with my data or any habits I've been tracking, even though I have the premium account. When attempting to sync It always says that there is no internet connection, but there always is. So I can't give it a full 5/5 rating, otherwise I might.",neutral
"I think it could be more user-friendly, but maybe I haven't explored it enough. It keeps asking for a rating maybe it will stop now.",neutral
"I actually really love this app. I used it to create some serious personal progress. I purchased the full app but when I bought a new phone, it wouldn't let me sign out of my old device and into my new device. I emailed support about it...crickets. Never heard from them. If they can put together a decent support team I would give the app a 5 for sure.",neutral
There's this weird bug now where the screen dims and keeps showing the loading sign but you can still use the buttons. Please fix it!,neutral
Everything is good but i would like to see more then a five slots for habits,neutral
best habit tracker ✓ edit- can you guys fix the overall habitbull score graph? It's not accurate- always trending down no matter what.,neutral

I am not satisfied with this app because circles used for completing the habits look very dirty .,neutral
"Can only track 5 habits, but there are discussion forums. Most of the forums have no activity going on, but there are still a few users to talk to. Often times the app no longer syncs me to them, just like right now. The quotes have been stuck, too. Developers no longer support this app. Do not buy the premium version, as you will NOT be able to sync across devices. There are no more updates or customer support. This could have been the absolute best habit tracking app. So much wasted potential.",neutral
This deserves 5 stars. But I am not able to see discussions since the last one week.,neutral
Probably a good app and way to track your new habits but not being able to make a widget without a premium account is ridiculous.,neutral

Used the free version for a couple of weeks then paid £9.49 for the platinum version so I could sync to other devices. Really disappointed that the sync option won't work, and software support is non existent. For an expensive app I would expect the developers to be as helpful as possible when a customer has an issue but they have completely ignored my request for help!",neutral
I really like this app and find it useful for keeping me on track. Simple but effective. I used the free version for almost 2 years. At the end of the first year it reset and I lost all of my history. So before the end of the second year I bought the premium version and promptly lost all of my history again. I contacted support to see if they could help and got no response at all. I still recommend it for tracking your habits but don't expect to keep the info long term or get help if you need it,neutral
Really enjoying this app but wish I could track more than 5 habits!!,neutral
Too invasive and complicated.,neutral
Nice app,neutral
"This is a good app but the data analysis and visualization is fundamentally broken. The score and success percentage function in that they record the success values for the end of each day and then add that to the database. This means unfortunately that your success percentage never goes above your first day, when if you did the thing, you got 100%. As such, the visualizations are useless. A better solution would be to include rolling means of success percentage by x number of day intervals.",neutral

"It's a great app and has definitely helped me maintain my habits. I had been gifted premium early on, but I've found that the features have disappeared and I'm only seeing the base version. I like it enough that I want to buy it, but I worry about whether it will keep the features based on my experience and other reviews. I've also found a bug: when I have a goal set to 3x a week as ""success,"" the app doesn't recognize when I've had a successful streak and always shows as 0 successes in the streak section, whereas it's at 80% in the ""percent success"" section and many weeks of meeting my goal.",neutral
It's good app But it's not free if you want to add more than 5 habit,neutral
Odd that it doesnt count beginning and end of month corrctly in monthly tally,neutral

Also how is the success percentage measured if you only have to do the habit a certain number of times a week?",neutral
Does exactly one thing - tracks habits - but does it well and without pointless bloaty extras (or ads). Clean interface. Sadly app seems to have been abandoned by developers and premium features like sync no longer work. No way to transfer data.,neutral
I liked how I could customize everything but my linked google fit didnt update my steps (I had to input myself) and my notifications would only go off if I opened the app myself. Kind of defeats the purpose of linking and setting up notifications...,neutral

Limited functionality but reliable.,neutral
Went for the premium subscription without a doubt. Definitely benefitial to those to use it honestly. Edit: Everything's good but after changing phones I've suffered having to manually copy the same habit list because the sync function just doesn't work.,neutral
The app is great. I wanted to use this app as a way to help me to creat a better habit and staying on track with certain things. For me the notifications don't work unles I open the app and by that point its like my reminders have passed.. other then that easy app to use and navigate.,neutral

Customization of the interval chosen to calculate percentages would be very helpful.",neutral
Pretty average app,neutral
The Reminder option is not working....I have paid for premium to use the app to its full potential but Unfortunately....The basic feature of the app to remind you to stick to your schedule with respect to habits you creat dosent work....kindly help by resolving this issue... Color code Options are limited that can be assigmed to the newly added habit,neutral
A great way to track goals but quite limited in functionaliry and the Google fit integration doesn't work.,neutral
"habit syncing not working on paid version. app is great, but after phone resets and all my habits data of 2 months is lost. And the app is showing i don't have a internet connection even though i am writing this review on same internet connection. But other than that app works great , the widget is great and i use it daily.",neutral
Could do with a reward or goal feature when habit followed.,neutral
It's an okay app but I have found better ones such as I am sober. This needs to be paid for to be useful.,neutral
The app does not let me create a widget despite the fact that I have logged in ☹️,neutral
"Lots of unnecessary notifications, the GUI is confusing and is missing a few features for a habit tracking app, like splurging only every X days (but no less).",neutral
The free app is too limited. Other than that it's a good one!,neutral
"Doesn't save habit data when you switch to a new phone, even using the same login information. Won't let me choose a start date for my habit either, so it never shows 100% success like it should.",neutral
"The setup seemed nice, but the constant pop ups are so annoying as to make it unusable",neutral
"So far it's not flexible enough for me. Also, there needs to be an option to remove 'general discussion ' from the dash board. There seems to be a startling number of people with goals surrounding masturbation and porn and I just don't need to see that when I'm trying to inspire myself to play more music. I'm going with the stars as a benefit of the doubt as I haven't given it much time but I can't see me using this.",neutral
I just started using this app. my week actually starts with Saturdays while only Sundays and Mondays are mentioned. if you could modify this detail that'd be really appreciated 🙏,neutral
"I like this app and what it can do and am pleased with its functionality. However, having paid for the premium version, I find it annoying beyond belief that I get pop-ups every 2 weeks asking me to leave a review. So, developers, I've left one but you've lost 1.5 stars for spamming me with these requests. This shouldn't happen in a paid app without any opportunity to turn off these notifications.",neutral
Synching between my Chromebook and phone is a necessity for me and does not work on this app. The color coding for completed tasks is not intuitive.,neutral
App is awesome n also helps alot but its inbuilt password once forgot don't opens the app. Evertime i need to log out and again log in it. Plz solve my issue,neutral
"When you start a habit with giving points for it or like at least that and that amount of days, you can't just change it back to a simple yes and no habit",neutral
I really like this application. Very well done!  My reason for 3 and  not 5stars is the lack of any security. No option for fingerprint or pin before viewing what could be sensitive personal information.  PLEASE ADD SECURITY!,neutral
Good app but faulty notifications. The notifications and reminders were working perfectly but they only work now if I open the app. By that point it's too late. I need the reminders to work to be effective. I purchased the full version.,neutral
"Dont buy the premium, the widgets don't work (the reason I bought premium) and I set up notifications for each hour to remind me of a task, but the notifications only pop up if you open the app which render the notifications useless. Otherwise I enjoy the basic use of the app",neutral
It's ok but a bit too simple and the inspirational messages don't change not really very motivating to use this app compared to my previous habit tracker. The App's look doesn't come exciting to look at as well.,neutral
I paid for the premium version but all my habits records was deleted without explanation. They fix that problem.,neutral
shows monthly when startup even after changing it in the settings to show weekly. otherwise all around good app.,neutral
😀,neutral
good,neutral
it’s a great app and works great. helps me keep track of whether or not I took pills or did excercises or not. However it lacks the feature of ”multiple times a day” So if for instance a person was trying to create a habit to do something twice in one day. this app won't help since you can only click that you did it once. Does anybody know if thier is an app that has this feature?,neutral
I bought the paid verison. It does help us track the habits with simple yes or no questions and by answering with numbers. But habits aren't as simple as it is... we need other methods to track habits like options to enter time. If I want to develop a habit of waking up by 7.. it shouldn't be a yes or no question... I should be able to enter the time track it over the month.,neutral
I really like the app. Maybe just work on improving the graphs a bit more,neutral
Good,neutral
"The best app around for tracking habits. But the artificial limitation to 5 habits in the free version coupled with the eye-gouging price of the pro version lost it two stars. I paid, but I am NOT happy with the price.",neutral
Good app but only counts by day. 5 stars if there was an option to count times a week as well.,neutral
"Great format and tracking. £7 seems excessive for upgrade feature to use as a widget... Also, people have a form of spirituality rather than a religion: can that not be reflected in the app too, for inclusivity? Removing forum comments would be a great option: an unnecessary distraction.",neutral
nice but no daily notification come,neutral
unable to set custom notification sound. it uses default sound even after changing. others looks good.,neutral
"Notifications do not show up. Thought I have enabled all permissions and to override dnd, the notifications and reminders do not work.",neutral
"I have noticed when I write notes and leave the app to find out more info, the app locks which is fine, but what I have written before I leave the app is not saved which can be very annoying. There isnt even a warning or option to save before you leave the app",neutral
"Good function, weird execution. The program works great, but it has weird way of reminding the user of the habit. like saying Hey, tiger"" its just weird",neutral
love it,neutral
"I love the concept of habit bull, but it isn't user friendly",neutral
Good app. Minus one star because of the constant nagging. And that's in the paid version. :-(,neutral
Ok app,neutral
"Great for progress. Their motivation quotes stopped working. Plus it doesn't remember which habit you were last viewing... so a pain in the ass ""weekly"" intrusive display. I specifically looked for this app. Because it's simple and easy on the eyes.",good
Great for creating or breaking habits. Thanks so much.,good
Great,good
"Does what it should do, just a shame that you need to pay almost €9 to add more than 5 habits. For such a simple application, I think this is way too much.",good
Solid habit tracking app. Great for what I needed it for.,good
Works Great! I use it for almost everything. Especially when taking a new medicine or starting a new thing I want to continue,good
Works well and I love the cheery greetings.,good
"It has been effective in trcking my habits. Though i feel like the user interface can be a bit complicated and confusing at times. Overall, it works!",good
"Nice App. It has help me improve in my diet, work among others habits. However, there are some bugs which need to be fixed for a better experience. For example I set a habit for only Friday, but it shows up everyday yet I only wanted it to show up on Friday. Other it would receive 5 stars",good
Good,good
Would love to see a yearly review .. Other than that awesome app,good
Nice app. I wish there was an option to move a goal though. For example I want to workout 3 days a week. This app has you choose 3 set days. I don't necessarily know my schedule and would like to move around a goal. Otherwise I dig.,good
"This is a great app, easy to use.",good
Great,good
Easy to use.,good
"I really like this app but after changing from ios to android am not getting notification, motivational images, quotes there is some issue, please fix it",good
"Best habit app. But that will be superb, if there adde audio instructions of habits that we add.",good
Have used this app for almost two years. I loved the minimalistic features despite all other confusing apps out there. It would be great if worked on making it an aesthetic user interface .,good
I really like the app. However few weeks ago I've changed my Phone for new one - Samsung Galaxy A51 and now I've problems with a widget. Sometimes it is posible to check that habits are done with the widget and sometimes it is not. It looks like the widget just freeze. Can you help me?,good
Very Good For Habit Maker,good
I like it for a free app.,good
Good,good
Helpful for building habits,good
"The ONLY complaint I have is that the widget doesn't always respond if I don't have the app open in the background. Otherwise, I love this .. makes me feel all warm and fuzzy to see a slew of green checkmarks on my screen 🥰🥰🥰",good
Very good App to track good habits,good
The inspiration posters are not loading/viewable,good
When I add time to the habit it is in decimal so week and month totals are incorrect eg. 1.30 + 1.40 is according to app 2.70 while it is 3.10 actually.,good
The app helps me a lot. I would like to have more information about the action and habits tracking into an online dashboard,good
I enjoy watching my habits become habits everyday. I just wish there was a theme I could use,good
Good for me,good
"Great app. The app seem to have been abandon or just neglected by the creator, but overall this a great app",good
Good simple app. But sometimes it doesn't download,good
"Great app, but the daily picture does not work",good
Works very well.,good
Can we please add number of days per fortnight as an option to select along with week month and year,good
"Just started using this, I like it so far. There is a broken image on the main screen display, so I am not sure if I am missing something there. Does any one else see this?",good
"Pretty useful and very helpful, but it seems like it's not being developed any further. Could have a lot more great features.",good
"It would be 5 stars, but I regularly have issues getting the widget to work. Any suggestions?",good
"There's a square with a broken picture and a share button, green thumbs up and a red thumbs down on the bottom.",good
The tracking system is good,good
Easy to use and customize. Only 5 habits without premium payment.,good
"Simple interface, easy to use and efficient. Except for the price.",good
"Concept is great , helpful but alarms are not well synchronized when secured by password.",good
"Like the app and ability to easily keep track of a habit, but had difficulty figuring out how to keep track of it at first",good
"Simple yet powerful with a nice helpful community. But I can't register for some reason. It shows, 'something went wrong, please try in a bit.'",good
Good application,good
Very good app and it helped me to form habits.,good
Very basic but helps keep track of things,good
Too overloaded main screen,good
App is nice but somehow i m not able to delete the habbit which i recently added by mistake .pls guide,good
"I love this app! My only problem are the widgets for the app. Each widget freezes after non-use for a while. When the widget freezes, I can't mark complete or incomplete update my counting numbers for any of the habits and then I have to physically open the app to update habits. After I do that, the widgets work again until the cycle repeats itself.",good
"Efficient after set-up. Makes tracking easy. Would like to be able to set incriments on each individual category. Not a plus or minus ""1"" only",good
Very good!! Could use some more flare. :),good
"I have had real problems remembering to do even simple things, i have been using this app for 3 weeks and i have to say i'm pleased with the change.",good
Update on 8/13/20 fixed the reminder notifications. Thank you!,good
It is a great app. Maybe it could have a more attractive interface.,good
Good app to track your habits and build on good ones,good
This app is very good,good
Good reminders for habit formation,good
Good,good
"Helps me stay on track. At least it used to, since last update, I'm not getting any of the reminders I set up. Please fix.",good
A really easy way to track new habits. I have looked at other apps and this is much easier. Thank you HabitBull.,good
Very nice app......,good
A very simple habit tracker. Easy to use.,good
Useful,good
"Great app, really nice UI, no major bugs I've come across. Feedback: Could you guys increase the character allowance for the notes please? It can be frustrating to be recording notes for a day and have it run out of space. Thanks.",good
So far so good! It does do this weird thing where it highlights a different app after I've exited the app though... bit of a weird bug.,good
Motivational and funny remiders really help in pushing to do the task,good
"The app is good, but I think it's need better graphs and charts.",good
Good,good
"Great tracker! Wish there were more colors to choose from, especially if you have more than 8 habits you're tracking.",good
Sync doesn't work,good
👍🏼,good
"Best habit tracker I've used so far! Very flexible, good data to work with, I find it motivating, and I love that I can chose exactly what I want to work on, right away. The price is also very very good for what it is (thank you for not making it a monthly subscription!!). The ONLY reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I love using the widgets however they are quite glitchy. For example today I have 1 habit that dissapeared from the calendar & check off list. Sometimes you can't tick off",good
Nice app. the icon got problem.,good
Nice,good
An improvement would be to see running total on all habits page. Quite expensive for what it does,good
Good,good
Good app,good
good app...but they could add something like notification bar tab or floating widget or something so as to remind us constantly to keep us in check in order to develop out habits,good
"Great app, easy to use. Custom colours and categories for each habit. Limited to 5 habits on the free version is the only gripe",good
"I love this app. I like how simple it is to use. Worth purchasing. The only thing I wish is that it would open to the weekly spot instead of to a single habit. Maybe there is way to make that happen, let me know! But if you are looking for simple but great habit tracker I highly recommend this one.",good
"The best habit tracker app I've seen, would've done 5 stars, but I feel like something's missing, and I can't quite put my finger on it",good
Its great and easy to use but still the developers should try to make it some sort of strict.,good
Very useful and encourages motivation,good
Notification features should be free.,good
Good,good
Very conveniant and useful. The reminder function is also really nice to stay on top of activities.,good
"A straightforward, no-nonsense app with a vibrant community. I've found it very helpful to start to shape my habits. Thanks to the devs!",good
"Easy to use, and has helped me to keep track of my good habits.",good
Easy and convenient apps! But the setting to the habits can be more flexible it would be the best!,good
"Nice to track challenges, it gives it's own incentive to keep those day trains going.",good
loving it so far! keeps me motivated :),good
Good as motivation to track and tick off daily goals.,good
"A little hard to use at 1st. However, if you go through the tutorials. The app will help you develop habits. I have been using it for a month and am definitely noticing a difference. If you want to change your habits, download this app.",good
Good app. No lags. Does what it says. I'm happy.,good
Happy to see my progress. It's a great app to keep a track for my daily routines and things which I paid limited attention to create that into my regular day to day life.,good
I'm a big kid. I'd love it if the circles you tap to colour in were star shaped.,good
It's a quite useful program. Works reliably.,good
If wish the images of quotes would have the previous option too,good
I like the app but dont like the big list of discussions about guys not trying to masterbate at the bottom.,good
It helps me to change my habbit,good
Simple but effective.,good
Wish it had a little more options but still great and easy app,good
This has been a great app to build habits. I would give it a 5 star but your limited to only 5 habits at a time. You can get more but theres a pay wall,good
"Looks like it's not supported anymore. Shame. I used it for about a year and really liked it. Edit - looks like it works again, no idea when it stopped being broken as no dev ever responded to my inquiries about the malfunctions. Four stars because I liked it while I used it but I have found something better (Loop). Instead of once ""per week"" you can set a goal of once per # of days. Works better for me, and is more useful.",good
"Really good way of tracking habits and progress (exercise and quality of baby's sleep are my uses). Only 4 because there could be a little more on the customisation front (even if only in the premium version perhaps). I'd like to see something like a target for average number instead of pass/fail, that'd provide an extra way of approaching habits I think. I'm picking at hairs though, it's a very good app, that does the job it advertises.",good
Great tool,good
Very good quality app for habits,good
Simple yet perfectly helping me achieve my goals,good
Very Helpful app for us to quit/join any kind of habit With the help of this app i have now completed my 60 days of no smoking challenge Thankyou habit bull,good
Already helped a lot. Wish it had more colors.,good
"Great for tracking your bad habits, making new good ones, and building a better lifestyle for yourself. Bought the full version for more habit tracking, which is great if you are dedicated, but $7.99 is a pretty hefty price for just 100 habits, some inspirational quotes, and a mediocre social system. It has helped me better myself over the past week of using it, so I'd highly recommend trying it, at least in the limited free version before buying the full version.",good
"Good, better than the other apps",good
Good habit tracking app!,good
"Tracks many tasks in great detail (statistics available on averages and streaks, etc). It has progressive tasks, so you can check on goals that are multiple times daily (like drinking water) and come up with more info than ""pass/fail"". My only qualm is the color. The display is very busy and colorful. I would also like a quicker interface for ""progressive"" tasks.",good
Why there is different icon showing of app in play store and different on my phone pls make it same,good
Great app,good
"Wonderful app! I'm just wondering if I overlooked something, because if, for instance, I set a habit to ""every 3 days"" but end up doing it every 2 days instead, the app is counting the 3rd day as a fail? Which seems very strange to me, since I actually did better than needed!",good
This has been a pretty indispensable tool for me. It motivates me to do the tasks that sometimes I would really rather not do like put in eye drops or exercise. My personality requires checklists or I'll find excuses to skip doing things.,good
It's a little too early to tell. So far pretty good.,good
Really remarkable app.,good
"Used it on & off for years. Motivational but not annoying like some. Nice design, various views (week, month, specific habit progress). Wide variety of goal options such as doing something x amount of times a week or every x day of the week or month. ALL the stats. You can set a date to achieve the goal (app recommends like 60 I think). Discussion boards. Other features as well, I just don't use them much. All in all, great app.",good
Get me focused and motivated,good
I liked this app it is really helping me and reminding me to do things on time and I am able to be proactive,good
"A great app that helps create new habits or break bad habits. If you want to set goals, this is the app to use. Tried many of the same type of apps and this is, by far, the best & easiest to use.",good
Sehr hilfreich.,good
Home,good
"I'm using this app since a week. Loving it so far. I think some new cool features like challenges would be fun and engaging. Will make it 5 if that happens. Besides, I recommend you to use this app for developing a new habit or skill. The numbers makes you feel good about yourself.",good
Genial!,good
Can UI can be improved to add habits with more customisation.,good
great!,good
Numerical entries should default to the previous days value,good
Easy to use and helpful to keep good habits on track.,good
C'est bon,good
Loved it. Motivates me to keep me on track with my set targets.,good
Ok,good
I love this app for easily tracking my habits to work towards personal goals. There's only two things that could make this app better: being able to disable decimals on specific habits (to count full numbers would be great as you do sets of a workout and make updating the count easier) and not losing the progress of a goal if you change the specifications to meet it (like going from doing 10 to 20 pushups a day and not losing the streak from before the change was made).,good
Bug has been fixed! Now i can use it with all my devices!,good
Great tool!,good
"Using the free version and it's easy, intuitive, and highly flexible...It reflects just what I want to track for five different tasks each week (from simple task tracking of daily meditation to more complex tasks like 3x a week business actions where I log time spent on these actions and notes too!) I've already recommended it.",good
Useful app,good
"I have only been using this app for about six days, however I'm really enjoying it. I like that you can mess with the color scheme and the encouraging quotes. It's also affordable if you are more than five habits. One thing I think that would be absolutely amazing to have on here is a spot for goals and some kind of daily journal write. Aside from that I love it so. 🤗🤗 If it had a spot for journal writings and goals it would definitely be five ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",good
Good app really helpful....but i think it should include permanent tracker in the dropdown menu,good
Great to get started with a healthier lifestyle.,good
"Dear Developers, When syncing will be fixed? Thanks",good
Great for keeping track of my workout and non drinking days.,good
Free and easy to track ur new habits,good
"It's a good app that lets us develop 5 habits if one isn't a pro user. I think it's a good idea to start small since developing a habit, just one habit, takes atleast 2 months if not mistaken. Overall satisfied.",good
"Good one, to keep up the momentum :)",good
"The app is simple & clean. Tracks Habits efficiently. The only reason I am giving 4 star is because Reminder notifications aren't working properly. Habit Tracker, please fix it!",good
Great!! its simple....,good
Good app to track habits,good
Animations are a bit choppy and mediocre design but great functionality,good
only 5 hapits for free,good
"this is the best app I have ever used to keep track of my activities.The greatest part is that each time you feel like giving up to achieving your objectives, it will always remind you, which is very motivating. I only have one problem though,having trouble with syncronising my progress, which means if the app was to be accidentally uninstalled and then reinstalled again, then all the progress I had saved would be lost, so this one reason I give you a 4 star rating instead of a 5.Good app though",good
Easy to use but it seems really basic,good
Love it except I can't change the positive memes at the bottom anymore.,good
Great app... I am using it for a while... Functionality wise it the best in the market... It can get updated in terms of visuals and performance,good
UI/UX can be improved a bit more,good
"I love it, simple and effective! Is it right that the motivational pics don't switch anymore? Mine has been stuck on the very same for a year now :(",good
i like the design,good
Heyyy dear Developers..!! Love the app.. but have a issue in it.. IDK if it is only with me.. the App doesn't show any reminder after 1 day of setting a habit goal.. only 1st day it does..,good
"In general, this app helps me keep track of my habits, which is great; however, the app has quite a few bugs, even after buying the premium version, which is disappointing. The sync function doesn't work at all and I don't see any effort to fix these issues. This is one of the rare apps where I won't be giving a 5 star review.",good
"Very good and gets the job done, not the prettiest or well designed but certainly not the worst! It's exactly how it's pictured and works fabulously too. No crashing or issues here.",good
"Good app, tracks nicely good widget. Sometimes notifications can be a bit flaky.",good
Extremely easy user interface. Helpsnin using the app more and note the goals.,good
"Simple, easy to use.... makes it very easy to keep track of habits...",good
"I like the app. Have been using it for a few months now, and the widgets plus reminders definitely keep me on track. Only drawback I've found is the inability to sync my profile - always fails with 'sync failed, make sure you have a working internet connection'. Have sent in support request, but so far no response. That aside, the app works well, and I can still use it in 'standalone' mode on my primary Android phone.",good
It is all for me about habits i wasn't able to work on it but in this one it is so helpful just i have one issue i don't know if didn't find it or it is not at the program that if u need to remind your self more than one time in the day i just remind my self once a day i don't know if it in the app or not,good
Amazing experience,good
"App is great. Helps me keep track of my daily habits. I like how the interface is simple and easy to use. However, I've been experiencing issues tracking my habits using the widget.",good
"The images with quotes wont change, good app tho",good
Best habit tracker app i have used,good
"Fun and engaging way to track your goals and form better habits. I'm still not great at keeping up with it, but the app works well when I spend the time to pay attention to it.",good
Easy to use and very flexible.,good
Great way to hold yourself accountable for setting goals,good
It's cool because it's gives me motivation to push myself and allow me to see my struggle in addiction for every day I fail.,good
Worked well for my purposes,good
"Nice app, would like further customization for habits, such as perhaps scores, the better you tackle a habit (healthier eating today than yesterday resulting in a higher score) this would make the app much more useful for me, otherwise great app",good
Love the reminder to log your habits,good
"Great app. Quite simple, it has a specific purpose, but does it well.",good
"Liked the setup so much that I quickly became a premium user. The widget alone is worth it. I love the flexibility the app allows in specifying when I can work on developing a habit. As I am frequently adding habits, I would like to rearrange habits in the list to make it easier to find them. Hopefully, this is an easy fix. Then this will be a 5-star app.",good
"A good starter app 4 collecting the data you need to better your daily life. Limited flexibility, in the free version, but sufficient four basic tracking of self-improvement efforts. Easy to get started. And so I can do without cute reminder and encouragement features, they are easy enough to toggle off.",good
Works well. The interface is a little odd. You have to scroll down to see all the graphs.,good
"Удобный, наглядный трекер привычек с подробной кастомизацией. К сожалению, не всегда корректно срабатывают напоминания - во всплывающем окне не нажимаются кнопки, приходится переходить в приложение, чтобы отметить выполненное действие.",good
"Havent been using it for a long time but so far so good. However, the paid version should have more features, such a costomizing your own categories. Also, the widget should be more customizable, such as font size.",good
"This app seems to work pretty well. The user forums aren't well managed, but remain useful. Habit Tracker has never crashed on me, but it does have the annoying habit of changing where in the UI has focus at the time you launch the app. Fortunately its easy to navigate.",good
Simple app that provides all I need to track habits. UI could use a refresher.,good
This is closest to my expectations,good
"I like this app, I have used it for a while now and it helps. Only reason for 4 stars is that the percentages are frustrating. I managed 122 days straight but it won't change from 98%. I think once you do the full 66 days you should get 100%. Also, would love to be able to highlight a day in the future as a milestone, just different colour so I can say 50, 100 days etc, as a motivator. It's great for a free app. We'll done to the devs on this.",good
"Love this app, but it only lets you keep track of only 5 habits at once, for more you have to buy premium, but other than that, its great!",good
it works well for me,good
"Great app.. please add the ability to see when recurring habit is due.. or by automatically completing a habit which is not due, i.e. required once a week for example..",good
It would be a very good choice for those who want a daily base motivation to make your way to build on the habbit..try not to break the streak of your habbit goals at any cost from which you can gain the max from this app . Well built interface with motivational images loved it❤,good
"Using for a week now, i like seeing the statistics and that the free version will track 5 habits.",good
Its useful,good
Very helpful,good
Would be perfect if you also have pomodoro/timer to do each task,good
Good visual reminder and nice to see patterns of habit breaking,good
I'm using the app for about a week. So far so wonderful :),good
It is perfect.,good
Simple and amazing app.,good
Very good 😃,good
"Really good app, it actually helps me stay focused and on track with all the positive habits i have created for myself.",good
Wonder full app,good
"I love how simple this is! It's helped me focus on those important things that I want to accomplish. I just wish there was space for more than 5 free habits!!! This means, if you decide to track something else in that space, then you'll lose the data, unless of course you write it down before changing it. This is why it loses a star, in my opinion. It's the best FREE habit tracker I've found! A lot of other apps have free trials, which I don't even bother with.",good
"At first seemed like a habit on w habit, but now it is a part of my habits. I find it indispensable today.",good
Yes its nice,good
Great app!,good
Sweet and Simple,good
"Simple and useful. You're allowed to track 5 habits for free. Upgrade for up to 100 habits. Best feature is that you can track a habit in terms of counts i.e. 3 times a week (any day), instead of every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Quite a rare feature for most habit trackers.",good
It's easy to use and there is suggestion on how to use it efficiently,good
Very good,good
"Good application, To keep a watch on habit and becomming sucessful. In my opnion if you are sucessful for 90 days habit is created. I am usuing again to review and creat habit.",good
Great and useful App!!,good
It's amazing. Very useful. I m happy to use it,good
Simple & easy & exactly what I was looking for.,good
Easy to use and exactly what I was looking for in a goal tracker.,good
It's soooo good. ^-^♡,good
"I tried to get back into meditating, and exercise/drinking enough water, etc. but I couldn't fully commit to it all until I downloaded this app again. I'm a perfectionist so I like to keep my habits completion at 100% 😉",good
Awesome app. Been using it to track my sobriety. Its been 3.8 years now. Best thing 5 habits tracking for free. Plus community support of like minded ppl. Great design and quotes and notifications. This and habithub are my favourites. Cheers.,good
Very good,good
মোর বড় বেশি ভালো লেগেছে,good
I use it to track just a few things. Works nicely.,good
Nice app,good
"Life Changing!!! I've been using this app for 2 years and it has changed my lifestyle. I actually bought the premium and I didn't regret it at all. I love that it is intuitive, the streak motivates you to keep doing. I love that there are more rewards that comes with the streak. For example, if you reach 30-day marked, you should receive a badge or trophy just to keep us motivated.",good
It's good to help u maintain consistency,good
Cool,good
Great,good
Life changing,good

It was great,good
Simply good,good
It motivates you to work,good
"The best! I tried 10 habit trackers. Wish it had Edge screen implemented like Habitsooz tracker (it's an app but also has Edge Screen so you can view all habits & check/uncheck them off quickly rather than having to leave current screen, find the app, open it & search for habits. It's there on my screen at all times, just gotta swipe the edge screen handle to see). Edge Screen is on Samsung phones, I'm sure all devs kno it. I can send u screenshots what Habitsooz edge screen looks like jst ask",good
Great !!!,good
Excellent,good
Perfect,good
Pretty good app to track your habits,good
I Keep coming back cuz it's got best balance of simple and versatile,good
Very useful and helpful app. Straighforward and easy to navigate.,good

"Love this app! I track my exercise, which I can track 5 days out of 7 and I also track whether I made good food choices",good
Simple & effective. I've used this a lot over the past few years & found it extremely helpful. Strongly recommend.,good
It pushes me from my comfort zone to do something important,good
"User friendly interface. Been using this for quite some time and so far, I like it as a free version. Easy to use and does its job. Like others, I don't really use the chat but I don't mind it at all.",good
Very good.,good
"The UI, data, and systems are all great. I only wish there were a one time lifetime subscription.",good
Gets the job done,good
Easy to use and has notification reminders,good
We appreciate your efforts to make this app soo complete and helpful. Thank you.,good

"This has been great to remind and motivate me, both with breaking habits and making new ones.",good
"Phenomenal experience with the app, so easy to visualize your streak. Best of all, you can do it w/o login into it, so if you are paranoid for security, this is the app for you. With minimal permission on your phone, you can track the new habits you want to install in a very simple fun way.",good
Love this app and use it everyday. Very simple and straight forward.,good
Easy to use. Simple. What I was hoping for.,good
"Best habit app I have tried. Clear layout, and I like the option to list habits you would like to focus on in the future.",good
The best I have ever used. The pop up reminders prevent me from skipping a day,good

Wonderful app. It helps a lot on trekking my progress and motivates me not to give up,good
Good simple app. Does what it says and doesn't ask anything in return,good
This has been a great experiment...i really like this app. I feel motivated to see the check marks and have feelings of confidence!,good
"Really nice tracking app. I really like the number per day function as it also keeps track of the total for the week, month, and overall.",good
I like this app. Would be good if you can implement option that allows miscellaneous days to count towards an activity. E.g perform a task 3 times a week (any non-specific day).,good
Simple yet useful... what a great app,good
Kisses for the developer,good
Good basic no- frills app,good
Super helpful and easy to use!,good
I have some things that I struggle with. This app has helped me to look at patterns and shows me physically what is happening in my life. It's very easy to use and you can track multiple things at once. I recommend giving it a try. .,good

Higher app,good
Cool App,good
"I paid for it so I could track more habits......love it. Always works good,it's colorful and motivating",good
This app is supperb.....from india.🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳,good
I got a best friend in daily practice,good
Just came here after you becoming sponsor of rewirs channel in utube Well I am thanks full that I got to know about this app by rewirs (that is also a very gud channel),good
"Awesome habit tracker, I like that you can go back in time to track a habit you've already started.",good
Well it works for me. Seem to be keeping up with my habit. Slowly introducing a new habit every 2-4 weeks and building up my habits.,good
Easy to use.,good
Awesome app,good
Great aoo,good
Really easy app to use.,good
A very necessary app. It has changed my life very well. Thanks for creating this app.,good
Awesome app.,good
Latest update makes the widget not working,poor
Pay!,poor
The app sends too many notifications with annoying sound 😡,poor
"Spam notifications. When the To Do List app auto updates it changes you settings, for example causing spammy push notifications to pop up after i previously disabled notifications.",poor
"It shut down after I tried to delete the preset characteristics, and I lost everything right after I had just set everything up. Really frustrating!",poor
"Between tasks randomly failing without any input and undoing failed tasks creating fake duplicate tasks that cannot be deleted, this app is too buggy to use for its intended purpose.",poor
"Seems like if I don't want to follow that junk on Instagram, I get - 15 points. Instant uninstall.",poor
Not very intuitive,poor
It takes forever to download,poor
I haven't even opened this app and it's already drained 30 percent of my battery! Wow. Waste of time and space.,poor
$50 for a simple app? No thanks.,poor
This is a really dumb app.,poor
This app automatically downloaded when i did not ask for it. Very intrusive.,poor
"Novel, but boring",poor
Is quite expensive,poor
"❌=DO NOT USE THIS APP if you need reminder notifications as they DO NOT WORK even with app visable on screen, let alone in the background! ❌=App is pointless as DOES NOT STAY ALIVE IN MEMORY! ❌=Ignore reviews from users who HAVE NOT TESTED THE APP! ❌=You cannot set a notification after task start time so NO WAY TO CONFIRM TASK COMPLETION! ❌=Widget DOES NOT UPDATE! ❌=Dev NOT INTERESTED IN FIXING- complaints still exist since app creation! ❌=Many better apps to use instead- THIS APP DOES NOT WORK!",poor
Tested on 4 Android versions and devices: 1• Reminders only work with screen on & app in foreground (app doesn't stay in memory!) 2• Can't rearrange hero screen to move graphs to bottom. 3• Every notification 'Perform' button click= annoying popup to confirm AGAIN- can't be disabled!! 4• Needs option for notification X minutes AFTER task start/end (Users need notification to inform what to start PLUS notification option to confirm it's done (at the task end time.)) Subscibe when fixed!,poor
"Doesn't work at all - as a developer myself, it's clear they don't know what they're doing. It should have every possible one but doesn't have ANY broadcast receivers or persistant notification to keep it alive from Android oom freeing up memory which explains no-one receiving notifications as seen in other reviews. Even when active, notifications only received upon screen on despite battery optimization execlusion or doze completely disabled with root. 5 stars and will subscripe once fixed.",poor
"This app will create a ""Review my tasks"" reminder when you launch it for the first time and by default will set the reminder to ""5 hours before"". This can mean it will wake you up in the middle of the night with this reminder playing a loud notification sound. It ignores the Do not disturb mode of the phone. It fails to show any visual notification so you will not know why your phone is making sounds in the middle of the night.",poor
Too complicated UI design. I just need a mindless tracker,poor
"UNUSABLE and BADLY DESIGNED due to being full of confirmation POP-UPS and BUGS. EVERYTHING you do or don't do in and out of the app is followed by dozens of POINTLESS pop-ups which causes the app to CONSTANTLY CRASH! e.g. there's no need to confirm notification button presses! Once there's an option to disable all pop-ups, this rating can be updated to 5 stars and all of us can subscribe to premium. Let's see if the developer is interested in fixing and receiving more subscription revenue",poor
"Too complicated, wanted to use to strategize for my exam but it was to difficult to add a task.",poor
"I like the app a lot, bit I can not make the notifications sound to work. I have enabled all notifications in setting - both the phone and the app but the only notification I'm getting is in the notification bar? Without the notification sound the app is quite useless.",poor
"Good app, but does not respect ""do not disturb"" mode and keeps waking me up every night. EDIT: the issue is fixed, giving the deserved 5 stars. EDIT2: this is not fixed, after all. Somehow this app not only not respects the do not disturb mode, but also manages to send notifications one hour after I fell asleep. Today it sounded around 4 am!!!",poor
I just cannot be notified. Please. Fix it. So I could give 5 stars.,poor
"I love all the recent changes you have made - especially the ability to undo things in the history. Could you please add an option to manually reorder tasks? I would like to put mine in the order that I do them throughout the day, and none of your sorting allows that. Thanks! Update: it's been 22 months since you said you'd make drag and drop sorting an option. I see monthly updates but not the one feature that would make this app user friendly. Don't promise what you won't deliver.",poor
Don't offer to send notifications if you won't actually do it. That was the whole reason why I thought this would help me and it didn't. Will be uninstalling.,poor
Too much ads appeared out of no where.,poor
Key functionalities of the app are hidden behind a subscription of $6.50 per month with the best deal. Simply shameless.,poor
"Ads too frequent, didn't even finish setting up first days tasks",poor
"There are more effective, and honest, ways to turn a buck in the Playstore. Crippling your app with a paywall only drives home just how unnecessary the app is.",poor
"Could be good if basic features like icons weren't locked behind a paid subscription. Update: your calling THEMES an advanced feature because you want to not because it is one.... Sorry but changing the background color to black, which it should be in the first place isn't an advanced feature, it's about one line of code. I'm a software engineer myself and know the difference between the two. Same goes for icons which are essentially to app functionality. Check out Notion for a great example.",poor
"Crippled version without even a way to purchase outright. EDIT: I'll be clearer. Many apps features are disabled. But there is no way to just buy the app. The only option is some ongoing payment subscription which makes no sense as this app does not provide any ongoing or backend service, it's just an app! and a simple one at that. It's like going to buy a water bottle and going to check out they take your credit card info and charge you the same price every year that you use the bottle. Bottom line, it's just a scummy business practice.",poor
"Only just discovered there's a bit of a, sub didn't make that clear before sign up no chance its a cheek doing it sneekly you should be ashamed deleted",poor
The app is amazing and has the perfect layout for a list RPG . But there's a subscription you have to pay for. Literally completely ruins the purpose of the app.,poor
"Notifications don't work. It's a shame, because I wanted to buy a subscription. [EDIT] Okay, I already know what's going on. The operating system of my smartphone is MIUI. This app's notifications work when the battery saver mode is turned off. At the same time, in the application settings I have the option: ""No restrictions - battery saver doesn't restrict app's activity."" Other applications similar to this one (ToDo, habits) work with this option and at the same time enable battery saving.",poor
The app doesn't notify me when the task is ready to do. Please fix it or tell me what to do. Only when runs the app tasks work.,poor
Rs1050 have been deducted from my account twice for yearly subscription but in the app its showing that i have not purchased any subscription yet,poor
It seems the app is not build for longer and more complex use. It looks like it can be used for people that plan to follow and develop their behaviour but the level of this app is of a game. Takes too long for resolving the bugs and no reaction to feedback. App crashes when using the calendar options. This should not happend when using payed version of the app. Waiting for improvement or giving up using and paying for this app.,poor
"Looks really complicated, and it's entirely prescription based. I felt like I needed to take a class to learn it. There are a lot of apps like this. I'll try another one.",poor
Подписка на полгода пропала сразу же после переустановки приложения.,poor
I'm sure the dev is well intended. Just no for me. UX is terrible.,poor
"Super cool if you're a dude and want one of the multitude of dude avatars. If you're a woman, I hope you want to be a nun, a woman holding an umbrella over a puppy, or part of a couple. Not even kidding. Definitely a guy created this app and had an all guy panel of betas.",poor
"DON'T download. After installation my calendar was FULL of commercials! ""You won an iPhone"" events with alarms.",poor
Tasks don't update their descriptions until you quit and re-open. Can't set more than 7 tasks without paying an absurdly expensive weekly subscription,poor
"read a negative review which had a reply to someone calling out the subscription, they said all ""major"" features are available for free. No, no they aren't you can't access the calendar at all it's an entire tab on the bottom of the app it's pretty ""major"" in my book",poor
"app crashed after creating a daily task with 2 day habit. would fail and bring up a warning that the task failed and to press OK. however you couldnt tap ok, it just did nothing. this happened every time. gave up and uninstalled the app. on a pixel 2 XL",poor
The pop up adverts are so loud ... Terible !,poor
Decent app but repeatedly asking me to pay a monthly subscription for a fancy to-do list is completely unacceptable. Take no for an answer.,poor
"Enough with the pop-up ads! I don't mind if an app has ads, but if I'm going to be interrupted by a 15 second video every 5 seconds while I'm checking off my list I'm deleting your app. And no, I'm not going to subscribe just because you keep popping up the subscription page. If I have to pay to make the app decently usable, you may as well require I pay for it to begin with.",poor
very bad experience,poor
"All right so to be clear, this app is amazing and I'm really happy to see that someone has made their own version of it! Even though it's such a great program, it became unusable at day one. It had bugs and limitations that hindered what I was attempting to accomplish. Problems such as: inaccurate characteristics, no quick access from rewards to inventory, non removable default achievements, inaccurate values on skills after undoing a task and hidden xp multiplier from skills to characteristics.",poor
"Annoying, obstructive ads. got fed up after one had a fake X button that was designed to trick you into tapping on it.",poor
Couldn't figure out how to set reminder times won't do anything other then am,poor
kicks me out of the game instantly. Not for me.,poor
"че то вступительного туториала не достаточно, чтобы понять что делать",poor
notification not working,poor
Crashes on android 4.4 (miui 9),poor
Buggy! Won't let me edit rewards. No.,poor
"Auto-fail only works if you go to each task? That's not auto fail. Makes no 
sense. Might as well go back to Life RPG. that feature was the only reason 
I even tried this. Subscription model ridiculous. Why would I pay a MONTHLY 
fee for some icons? They are helpful icons & necessary mostly, but that's 
just ridiculously expensive for some icons. A one time fee is reasonable. 
Even if it was like $5. I wanted to like this app, but this got in the way.",poor
My entire plan was suddenly removed,poor
This is worst task game in my life,poor
"The English used is very poor,  thus, if the developed cannot master simple rules of grammar, why should I trust them with such sensitive subject matter?  Uninstalled!",poor
Somehow bought it's own subscription? Then I had trouble cancelling. Was enjoying til it stole my money. I never saw any payment authorization window.,poor
Uninstall app that wants sell me every small feature  ✔DONE,poor
One of the worst in the genre,poor
"This app is very, very, very sexist. When you start the app up and go into the ""icon"" menu for the avatar of your ""hero"" character, the vast majority of the icons possibile to select are definitively male.   Worse yet is that all of the ones 'intresting' in thier design - or portray something such as the workplace are entirely male.  The few female icons avalible - more than half not even on their own- are showing an entirely narrow view with a subservient feeling in thier portrayal.   The developers of this app should be ashamed of such blatant misogyny.",poor
"I click undo but retain the XP. No real theme or this app, very bland. Needs character",poor
Way too complicated to use. This app could be so much simpler. The time I've wasted on it is time I could be doing tasks.,poor
"The app isn't performing very well, everything is laggy and when I press any button it takes 10 seconds to load. I can still reccomend this app to any avid gamer who's looking for a way to actually do their tasks. but it's just too LAGGY.",poor
"Complicated interface. Adding a repeating task for specific days in the week is very tedious and buggy. I added a task repeating Mon, Wednesday, Friday and it gets added to my list for today, Saturday. UI and UX could really use an overhaul.",poor
It's not well organized. I couldn't organize my schedule nicely. I think it should be more simple and easy. Also reminder didn't work and i don't know why.,poor
auto fail doesn't work properly. Subtasks don't work properly for repeated goals.,poor
Very useful but completely loses it's value when you don't get notifications of tasks that you need to do even though you put multiple notifications you could get one and none of the others. Other times you don't even get any I mean how are you supposed to stay on time on certain tasks when you don't even get the reminder? Please fix this problem.,poor
Nice idea for an app but don't like the fact that you can't customize the hero to be a woman. Also think the interface could do with an upgrade for a better user experience and the app could do with a lot more refining over all to improve it. Edit - but there are no female icons.,poor
"A lot of work was put into this. I love the idea of it. I just got this, and I was looking through the app, seeing what I can do. I love the features and what you can do. You can use the app, without buying stuff but what your selling it for is crazy. $46 for one time purchase is a bit much for a task reminder. Or $10-$20 for half or full year. I love the app. I would pay for it if payment is $2.49 one time purchase. Or $12.99 for one time purchase, instead of a 6 months.",poor
"I had the same problem where I started this app in the middle of intense projects and moving so I fell a couple days behind. Unfortunately skipping dozens of tasks was too time consuming and I don't like leaving a bunch overdue. I know partly it's my impatience, so I have two stars. The other is it just isn't for me.",poor
"Seemed like a great idea, could not for the life of me figure it out.",poor
"Calendar is a premium feature, making this pointless without a subscription.",poor
"Good idea, implementation to be revised. The management of the task is not clear. The dates are showed in a confusing way. Again, the concept is good, but the user interface has to be improved and updated.",poor
"Ok concept, but just takes way too much effort to make the core concept even work on a basic level. Kind of feels like this kind of an app needs some sort of AI with suggestions for every parameter, and sync between different devices, to get the basic functionality into usable state.",poor
"When I checklist Today's note, automatically Overdue's Note checked too?? what's wrong..??",poor
"So cool, but insanely expensive. Also, wasn't clear how to get started even with the manual. I have no reading comprehension issues, there is just no ""getting started"" section or similar. Then I saw the fees, $50?! WOW that is high! I hate when people gripe that they're asked to pay for apps & am a big fan of supporting developers, but $50 is nuts. This isn't a service one subscribes to, ex. Spotify, and $50 is NUTS to purchase an app. Not trying to be mean & am fine paying but $50 is way high.",poor
A chore to figure out,poor
notifiction is not working properly. When I set a task reminder when it is near finish dead line. App doesnot send me task notification about its deadline. Not Working,poor
I had to put in all the info,poor
"One of the most expensive apps I have ever seen or tried. Everything costs money. Subscription? Check. Paid themes? Check. I mean, I spent a fortune on apps, and I am in favor of continuous support, but still. Losing my lifetime savings is just not okay. Reminds me of the app Newton Mail where they went from free to Oh My God This Is Expensive. IMO users would sub way more if the options were affordable. Sorry for 2/5 but if an app is inaccessible due to prices, I can't say that it's an ok app",poor
"Confusing, over complicated, and bland looking. The fact that I had to go delete the habits that it had already chosen for me, made it worse",poor
"I try to set tasks for only specific days of the week, but it does Not work. After I complete the task that's it. It's done forever, doesn't repeat. Since most of my tasks need this feature to work...the app really isn't good for me.",poor
"I was going to give 4 stars, but the app does something kinda sleazy where it asks you what you would rate it and only redirects you to Google play if you said five stars, so I lowered it to 2 stars.",poor
"I started getting notifications but all came at the same time instead of their specified times, so just removed them and no longer use. Biggest feature I would like see fixed is there seem to be issues with using the ""Today"" option for the task list Widget. Sometimes will only show one task and sometimes when I can complete all my tasks, the next day the list doesn't refresh, still says ""All tasks are done!""",poor
I liked it but most of intresting features was unable until you purchase them.,poor
"Do you love apps that design their experience to be poor unless you pay ongoing ""subscriptions"" for static feature sets that make the experience barely tolerable? Do you prefer having money siphoned from your account over and over again instead of paying a single small fee once for an app, like we used to see? Then this is the app for you! Add one more debit to your bank account they hope you'll forget about (and statistically speaking - you will) for a stagnant app you'll forget about in a week",poor
"Too complicated. I spent a half hour looking at the guide, trying to figure it out. Created new characteristics and tasks, but on the home page, there's no drop-down to choose a task. When I saw I'd have to create one every time, I decided to uninstall. Suggestion: create tutorial. No one has time for the long guide. If we did, we wouldn't need a productivity app.",poor
It is complicated.,poor
"Spending $10 once or $5/year for a subscription would make sense to me; but paying $15/year to use a to-do list (when discounted) is really excessive. This is a great tool - actually, I love it; but I find it ridiculous to pay so much just to TEMPORARILY unlock basic features like a calendar. Edit: Since writing the above review, I've found cheaper/free alternatives. The one I'm using is called Treat Yourself. It's free and doesn't look great, but it serves my needs just right and I love it.",poor
Price is very high for Indian users. We don't get 1/10 of what a US citizen gets paid here so there app subscriptions at such prices don't make a sense.,poor
Is a pretty good app but it's got a pretty big issue which is how is it going to keep track of how many things I've done every day if it counts the current activity as if it was done the last corresponding day?,poor
Quite good one but I prefer single purchase option. But seriously I like the statistics. Well I saw it automatically logs out and not doing backup.,poor
"Annoying backup system. I've had installed this app and logged in with Google account once. I also tried some of the app's features, but I uninstalled again because of reasons. After some times, I decided to install it again. So I made my tasks and the others without logging in first (because I forgot). Then, when I logged in with my Google account after that, it replace my current data with the older one without warning. Now all my newly created, more complete data is all gone.",poor
"cool idea, but it keeps crashing when you try to add subtasks.",poor
I'm not interested in subscriptions. One time fee would be fine by me.,poor
Kind of ha are to get the hang of. Maybe I'm just stupid! IDK!! But I never did figure it out...,poor
Convoluted way of editing sub tasks and the undo button only works in te immediate moment after checking. Stats can't be reset. All the little thingd take a long time to set up due to the way interface is handled. It's also weird how 'done' can't be hidden.,poor
"doesn't do what I need it to do with setting recurring alarms, such as every 3 hours forever. it just says ""how many times"" do you want this to repeat but doesn't let you choose hourly. Just daily, weekly, etc.",poor
"User Interface is so tough, specially for a new person.. Even there is no guide that how to use.. On front there r those things which r not useful for a working person like those Xp and all.. Don't know how to find week date or tym for an alert.. Not impressive..",poor
"Repeats tick now...however I encountered another problem. There's no way to restore ""purchases"". Meaning if you subscribe and than reset/wipe the app or your phone, you can't use the subscription features anymore. And to get it back you have to completely resubscribe.",poor
The ads on this app are cancerous and the subscription model for this type of app is ludicrous. Charge a single flat rate.  If the style does change to flat rate/ad free I'll gladly change my review.,poor
"I really like the application so far. Great interface and feature set. I'd really like to see and would even do an inapp purchase for would be a much larger icon set. I think being able to group characteristics and skills would be awesome too. Even better if the group can collapse. It would also be cool to see a health bar that represents the amount of time you have in a day to be productive. Have it decrement as time passes and maybe make it adjustable for how much time you have in a day i think another tasklist app does that. Overall a great application, I hope you continue working on this application.  Edit: The app is still decent, but taking away the option to just remove ads for a one time price in favor of subscription only has made me decide to stop using this application and change my previous 5 star rating to a 2 star rating.",poor
So you reskinned LifeRPG? What's different here?,poor
"By default, before the current update was rolled out, tasks were set to the date 'today'. Now they are being set to Feb 1, 3880. How weird!",poor
"This app is an excellent idea, if only it worked. I have been unable to move off the home screen without it crashing. Its a shame as it has a lot of potential.",poor
Refreshing tasks is a nightmare,poor
"I really liked the app but suddenly from nowhere all of my data were gone. One second they were fine then when I connect to the internet, it's back at lvl 0 with the Johnny avatar.  It seemed that there was no way to get my data back. Dropbox saved data seemed to have been overwritten so idk what to do. I feel betrayed being immersed in the apo then suddenly left hanging with the fact that I don't even know what caused it.",poor
Not a movable app,poor
This is not an rpg!?!?!?! This is a goal tracker with an avatar. Ffs. So Useless.,poor
Needs a dark mode.,poor
"Almost perfect... I only wish it had more to do with the ""game"" aspect. It's basically a to-do list or planner. Sure, it gives you some ""gold"" and experience points based on your completed tasks, but they amount to nothing, as there is nothing to do with either once collected. No built-in items to purchase, no character creation or customisation... disappointing. That being said, the tasks are easy to create and customise. I feel more organised than usual. So, thanks, I guess.",neutral
"I really like the depth of this tracker, including skills, titles, really more of an Elder Scrolls feel, and personally, seeing myself being lacking in certain skills would motivate me to add more tasks that would improve those. I was all set to subscribe and spend too many hours customizing the experience curve, all of the tasks and their various skills, and really dig into the advanced features, but then I hit the deal breaker. There is no web interface for this app. Everything has to be set up on your phone. I love having notifications and a checklist on my phone to keep up with repeating tasks, habits, and to-dos on the go, but I'm looking for an app to add dozens of things to initially, and continue adding and modifying as time goes on, but to have to do that on my Note 20+ is just something I'm not on board with. I need to be able to pull it up on my computer as I'm working to check things off, or see my next scheduled task. By picking up my phone being the only way to check what I need to do, it sets me up for failure, because my phone is a distraction I'm trying to use less while working. And since I'm working from home now, there's no accountability, so that temptation to check my facebook notifications is strong. If there was a way to open this on a browser (and not through some janky android emulator, or using my chromebook, because I don't use that for work) then I'd already be neck deep in it, but sadly I'm stuck using an app that replaces the reward of tracking real life stat progression with digital outfits for your avatar, something I couldn't care less about. Please get a browser interface going!!",neutral
I tried to set task to only do wednesday and friday and it wouldent work so I uninstaled. Apart from that its a good app.,neutral
Not for me. I was hoping for something with an alarm. Doesn't help if I don't get a reminder. Looks interesting though,neutral
"I gave this 3 stars. I do like this app and it has lots of potential. But I think in execution a few different arrangements would make it more useful. For example, if the default mode was to instantiate a particular task from a class of universal tasks, it would be easier and simpler than managing a list of variables under which tasks are contained. Characteristics could have sub-characteristics as well. Items could have more well-defined powers like delegating the task but not completing it.",neutral
"This app is incredibly unintuitive. Attempting to create an event with specific start and end dates is overcomplicated. I still can't get the ""specific dates"" option to function properly in the calendar. The app freezes if you delete the preset characteristics. This should not have left beta with so many duplication errors. Please fix this. I regret paying for this app. Edit: Additionally, deleting an occurrence of a reoccurring task only ones previous entries in it's place.",neutral
Działa ale zwykła aplikacja habits naprawdę wystarczy,neutral
Application is superb with only 1 big exception which outguns every good thing - Duplicate Task feature doesn't duplicate any of the underlying subtasks but just links them under the duplicated Tasks. So you cannot create a Template Task which could be used to create other similar deep Task structures for quicker task creation with similar structures. This is a must have feature if you really want to let users use this app deeply and consistently. Without this i will be forced to look at less,neutral
"The app crashes when there are less than 2 characteristics of the Hero. I like customizing, so at first I deleted all presets to replace them with my own, but if I delete all characteristics and then try to add 1 new characteristic the app crashes and the only way to get it to work again is to clear all the data and start the app from scratch.",neutral
"This seems like a great app, but if you fall off the wagon or take a long vacation, with dozens of daily tasks, then there's no realistic way to recover, because you have to dismiss potentially thousands of pass/fails until you can get a list of just current and relevant tasks remaining for today. Multi-select helps, but still no good after a summer break, or older user with a 12 tasks triggering daily for a year = 4380 to dismiss by tapping each one. Could solve with a ""Select All"" feature.",neutral
"Starting tasks are not useful for me, and creating my own task feels like it requires a degree. Not at all intuitive. I love the idea of it, but it feels too complicated, and I'd have to spend more time setting it up then actually using it.",neutral
Guys I really love this app and feature am.bkt confused of putting repeated reminder as am use to it and I love that reminder alarm to make me awake all the time I miss something. I can't find that or else please help me guiding for that..and also upload more videos on YouTube for new users to understand as you guys have hardly any video,neutral
"After the last update it won't let me check off my tasks without in-app purchasing, when it used to be free.",neutral
I don't know how useful this will be yet. But I should point out that subscribing to your Instagram shouldn't be an infinitely repeatable task xD,neutral
"I really enjoyed the concept, used it for about a year and paid. What ultimately stopped me from using it is it is not user friendly and glitched constantly. It wouldn't keep my settings even though I changed the default. Or populate tasks on my widget. Format for setting up recurring events is hard to navigate and it kept duplicating and deleting tasks when using desktop version. Basically an awesome concept performed poorly. I think if more resources were put in to this app it would be epic!",neutral
"Seems like a really awesome app, but blocks stuff behind a subscription or a buy all one time payment. Would rather pay piece meal. It also has ads in the free version that you can't get rid of without the sub or $50 buy all.",neutral
"Fine for ""Daily grind"" tasks, but a hassle for spontaneous tasks. Not for those who lack patience. Like the design tho :)",neutral
"This app is pretty cool and I'm trying to get used to be but geez its so difficult to just create the list of repeatable tasks I want to have. There's a today, tomorrow, important section and depending on how you choose to set up your tasks they might not be on any list. It's super confusing and aggrivating.",neutral
"The presentation is slick, highly customizable and the skills and characteristics offer an encouraging meta to ""just do one more thing before bed time"". Liking it! It would have been an easy 5 star if not for the widgets. Unfortunately they do not continue the established level of customizability. Especially rescaling elements of the Ui of ""All Tasks"" to fit it into a smaller screen is missing. Further, there is a bug that ""All tasks are done"" after clicking away two tasks. Oxygen OS 10.3.3",neutral
"A lot of bugs, low range of choose and opportunities.",neutral
Too difficult,neutral
This could have been the one but I can't take pictures.,neutral
"I really wish this had a website. Setting this up so far has been a pain in the butt. I get maybe they don't allow selecting multiple tasks to prevent cheating or something, but it really is tedious doing the same thing over and over again to 30 habits. Trying to push through it though, we'll see",neutral
"I'm sure some of what I experienced could be addressed, but the little things kept piling up: -Certain things are on autofail but history shows no failures -Items that failed/passed the day before aren't showing up in history for hours -Marked something as done but it alerted me to address it an hour later (multiple times) -Got notices to perform tasks that weren't scheduled for that day Plus others! Loved this app but finally gave it up.",neutral
"Why can't I set a task to be done 3 times a week, anyday during the week? Most of my tasks are like that. UPDATE: Okay. I'll try that. Thanks..",neutral
Too much lag & freezing,neutral
Good,neutral
"Nice idea with a few issues: some tasks never seem to go away. Whether I say I did them or fail or skip or try to edit they always stay there for the same day. Also, if I miss one day it takes forever going through each missed task and either skipping or failing or deleting or whatever. And like I said sometimes that doesn't work. Fix these issues and I could really get behind using this app.",neutral
"Very user unfriendly with hardly any explanation regarding what the buttons do or the stats mean. Trying to edit tasks for each day will only let me invent new tasks, not pick from a list. Utterly confusing. Could have been so much easier.",neutral
"Pretty fun idea, but the widget needs improvement. I always have to insert a new task or refresh the widget in order to see my task",neutral
Same review as rpg gamify,neutral
Good app and I like the setups that are already prepared for when u log in. My problem with the app is that it's too overwhelming. Too many things to manage and for my easily distracted and anxious brain it's too much. As constructive that can actually be applied--please make it so the tasks actually leave the list ocne they are completed. Some are infinite and its difficult to focus on what needs to be done. Otherwise. Good job on this app it's well made.,neutral
"I like the idea how it shows my skills but I hate it when it organize the tasks in orders, it sets up automatically wherever it wants. Manual task organizer should be available.",neutral
"This is a re-review. This could be the best habit tracker, goal setter and task manager, with some really great features like nested lists and smart/auto grouping and a very versatile repeat task setup. Just don't confuse the 'game' in RPG for any actual gameplay; but it does have a very elaborate character design and advancement system, that deserves recognition, allowing for a well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the user's daily life. However Do It Now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality. Firstly there is no way to order the tasks set out in any of the groups. After a solid month of use, building some projects with subtasks which had subtasks, and setting up several habit based routines, the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created a confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next. While auto-grouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared, once again losing the important ones in the clutter. User defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them- but once again a large project with a number of different aspects can not be ordered into a sensible linear series.. With no social aspect currently attached to the app (as at ver 2.23.0) there is no task sharing. There is also no designated pc/mac/linux front end for desktop syncing. Finally it's expensive as apps go. A one off of $75 will get the full version, or about $2.50 a month (paid yearly), which removes ads and gives calendar access. Original review: ""A good way to make the tedium of self regulation a bit more fun. Being able to plan to skip things when away from regular activities is handy. It would be nice to see characteristic and skill based modifiers affect related task improvements as they raise and subtask attached leader.""",neutral
"I used to use Habitica, and I must say this is a great step up. I'd like to see more social features, such as sharing tasks - only one person has to perform said task for it to be checked off, but only giving that person the experience and gold. Otherwise, the price for subscription is too steep, thus resulting in a sub-perfect score. I could easily justify $0.99/month or eternal subscription for $15. If that price could be met, as well as fine tuning, this would be easily worth 5 stars.",neutral
"As someone who has ADHD and deals with executive dysfunction, this is a very useful app! There are a LOT of paywalls though.",neutral
"Was really looking for an app that lets me have multiple repeats for a task within the same day, everyday. Duplicating a task multiple times and then making those into subtasks seems to be the only way, but it clutters up the task list (like 8 lines so I'm reminded to drink 8 glasses of water) and then subtasks show up twice in the daily list, both within and outside of the main task. I thought the ""repeat every 1 day, 8 times"" custom setting might work, but it's a different function.",neutral
"I like that this app notifies you for tasks, but it should respect Android system's Do not Disturb!! I shouldn't be reminded when I sleeping and I explicitly turn off notifications (no other app I have notifies me in Do not Disturb mode)",neutral
"I've just installed this app and will definitely play with it in the next few weeks. It really looks nice and really structured! So far my only surprise is that there's no female icon for the person. Only nuns or dancers, but not a simple female icon that doesn't do anything - just stands. Hello, is this app exclusively for men or is the icon hidden somewhere?",neutral
I am in love with this app so far. I wish there was an iOS version available to connect with my friends though... I would recommend this to everyone otherwise! 3 stars for now due to limited availability.,neutral
"This app should be made to work around certain schedules. For example; people who work the third shift (graveyard shift), have a completely different schedule than, say a person who works a 9-5/7-3/3-11, etc. I'm certain this adjustment would be greatly appreciated",neutral
"The app is great for the most part, i just wish that the 'notification option' for tasks would actually alert me. No alarm or even a pop-up message. I got this to help me remember to take care of certain things due to memory issues, but it's not gonna be of any help if i can't even remember i have the app. Please fix the alarm notification system.",neutral
"Ads were annoying and it took a lot of steps to set up tasks. However, it was nifty to use and definitely allowed a lot of control due to the aforementioned steps.",neutral
App itself is nice but needs a lot of polish. Right now it's kind of a bugfest.,neutral
"This app could be five stars to me. what is stopping me is the confusion on knowing just what tasks to do or not to do. There's a confusing list of tasks that show up at the bottom and if I did not do them the day before or not click them, they just show up there. If I delete a task from the calendar on accident what do I do? the calendar should be completely removed cuz it's worthless. I think tasks should have some sort of streak function or show how many times you have done it in a row.",neutral
"It's a good start...I currently have a 1 month subscription. Needs more habit type features. Needs to track , display and keep a record of current and longest streaks. Repeat option needs much more options like; 1. A way to track a task that's done a certain number of times a day like 3 times a day. 2. Repeat week, should also have the option to have the task done a certain amount of days not just on specific days. 3. Achievements should have an option for completing consecutive days.",neutral
"Might be good, but it doesn't have task library and trying to set everything up myself is not worth it.",neutral
App crashing a lot. Do look into it and solve the problem asap.,neutral
A very good but incomplete idea. There is no way to track time spent on certain habits. there is a big difference between doing 5 minutes of something and doing it for 1 hour... Besides the statistics are super limited and basic.,neutral
"Very motivational, but what's with the subscription fee!? Fifteen dollars a year??",neutral
The fact there are no predefined tasks makes it super hard to use. Or rather this will work if user can just define the task (quest) easily. Or maybe we can import (by purchasing) some set of quests. For me it is still quite confusing and hard to manage with all the options offered. would be use it furthere more if not too complicated,neutral
It would be great if the notifications actually works!! I don't get notified by any task I put in at all,neutral
Ok but doesn't feel too user friendly and kinda weird that the calendar is behind a paywall,neutral
"I went from touching the app once a day to once a week, over the span of about 2 months. Would be better if notifications were functional/ could be enabled. I like the concept of being a hero, though. I just always fail all my daily set tasks (repeatedly back to level 0 hahaha...) -- I stick to my sticky notes app (with reminders) that I've been using for years. [Edit 11/10/19]: I see notifications on appear on my phone now! Thank you.",neutral
"Setting things up can be a bit confusing but overall it's good. The notifications aren't working on my phone, and when setting the task to something that can be completed all day, I'd like to be able to set times for me to get notifications about it without having to do the weird ""give me a notification 12 hours before"" The whole point of me getting a to-do list app was to have not only a list, but reminders, so until the notifications work I'll have to resort to a different app.",neutral
Asks for a subscription to get all the features. I'd pay a one time fee only. Guess you don't want my money bad enough. Edit: yes I know which is why you got a negative review. I like your app. I don't like paying subs. I raised u to 3 stars for taking this so we'll. All to often devs get all butt hurt. Add a feature to buy a lifetime license even if it's 20 dollars and I'll buy it. Or give us an option to see ads without a sub at least. Cheers. Do this than 5 stars.,neutral
"I wanted to buy the app but the subscription feature turned me down. I wish there was a one time purchase option to unlock essential things like calendar, unlimited inventory etc.. (and the subscription for themes, sounds and other cosmetic stuffs)",neutral
"Really amazing, but there are pop-up adverts if you're not a member, and for someone like me that's quite a few adverts daily. Very annoying!, But everything else is PERFECT. FYI The designers have to eat so I'm not mad but God damn that's annoying Would be really cool if you could at least watch a bunch of adverts at once so you don't have to do it later. Just an idea id be up for.",neutral
"It would be good if it had alot of tasks that are given by the app accordingly to your interest, and even recommend books, etc. Also if there was a competitive mode where you can see what level other players are, and that to level up you have to do certain things that can be verified somehow (for example, read book requires a picture of a book with your face, or run requires a tracking through the GPS to actually verify yoy ran) in this way it can even be competitive",neutral
"Good experience, nice concept, sad that it's not completely free for a to-do list, and completely frustrating that it keeps crashing everytime I want to edit my level and changing my avatar. It went brainfarted when it got overwhelmed by a long list of levels starting from 50.",neutral
"A decent app for its intents and purposes but I struggle to stay invested. It's visually good, great icons and colours, also has a nice selection of skills. My biggest issue is the navigation. I can't immediately see or twirl down to see subtasks. Actually marking something as done, especially subtasks is a challenge - mostly because you face to keep tapping through the task and pages of info to get there. Perhaps a mind map or something would make it easier.",neutral
reminder doesn't work,neutral
"There could be any difference between gold that we earn. If my rewards are ""cheat meal"" and ""netflix episode"" and tasks are ""run 10 km"" and ""read a book"", it shouldn't be able to get a cheat meal reward for reading a book...",neutral
It crossed my mind to buy the full version but then i saw they want a monthly payment. Why not just make it $5 lifetime? Seems like a good app not sure who copied who with liferpg seems too similar.,neutral
"Very interesting concept but it's extremely time consuming to setup and add all the content you need. Also being able to edit everything and choose the rewards freely kinda looses it's purpose. I understand some people might like the feature, but I personally do not. Overall, great app if you have the time to set it up and get familiar with it.",neutral
"overall a really good app. well thought. however, I would personally spend some time on the interface/interactions. it became too many steps for my preferences. realizing I needed to change a bunch of tasks, I had to pick a task, bottom right to edit, then tap below description, untick termless, select date, click ok top right, another ok top right. that's too much. I suggest adding swiping options to the task (look at nine email as an example). but overall good. might return one day :)",neutral
Everything requires you to pay money might as well make it a paid game instead of deceiving people for a free app,neutral
"Awesome idea, five plus in advance. Although, turns out there are more appealing apps, interface wise. But non the less, it is all about insides, not the outside.",neutral
i love the concept but i would love to see a list of suggested 'to dos' cuz i can never think of things to do,neutral
The app is great but after using awhile it start to lag.,neutral
Too much paid only,neutral
"the app itself is a wonderful idea, but the interface and functions need a lot of work in my opinion. it took me so long to figure out how to set up a habit, and i still don't understand how to use a task groups or steps. I gave up and came back to my previous tracker because it was too complicated and time consuming to learn how to use this one. Anyway, I will definitely retry after an update :)",neutral
"I really like this app, makes life more fun foy ADHD brain. But sound making ads are a real pain. I'm okay with the ads in general, they don't pop up often enough to be annoying. But can we get rid of the ones that make sound so I can stop embarrassing myself in a quiet class room after checking off an assignment?",neutral
"I love the idea of it, but currently it's far too complicated for me to use. I'd love it very much if all the setting rewards and gained skills was a little easier to do.",neutral
"It's not bad. But it seems greedy. Like, why do I have to pay to unlock individual color themes if I'm paying a monthly subscription? Also, LifeRPG was so much better than this. More icons to choose from and they were free. If you're going to make an app that copies all the ideas from LifeRPG, at least make it better. Why can't I make an accomplishment like: learned blank piece of music, without having to tie it to accomplishing a certain number of tasks or reaching a certain level?",neutral
This app is great but the setting of the aims and the tasks takes a long period of time therefore it eats up your productivity,neutral
"it actually is a good app, but it wont do the one other thing I need it to do, which is notify me of a task I set. one day it does and the others it doesn't. I have reset my phone settings several times because of this, looked it up and still no results",neutral
"I really like the app, but I would enjoy it more if there was the ability to manually order tasks through simple drag and drop like in LifeRPG. Also, if there was a quicker way to edit like in Life RPG that would be great. I would be willing to pay as a way of supporting you guys, but right now LifeRPG is more practical and they'll get my money until you catch up. Love the decreasing skills btw :)",neutral
"Its ok, notifications dont work very often.",neutral
Needs fixes... Like the repetition is screwed also the generate habit... Looks like the developers don't use it themselves.,neutral
"With discipline training apps, the market bet is on already diligent people to buy your app. With such a small margin of customers you cannot expect success from limiting customization options to microtransactions. Let alone subscriptions. Otherwise the app was decent. Good work! Credit where credit is due!",neutral
Suggestion: Can tasks take things from the inventory? Maybe some items can only be acquired through achievements and those items are needed to complete a task.,neutral
"Don't like it very much, but I think it's just not for me. It's very complex and deep with tasks and such (I could even set the percentage of fear for a task... What??) so I didn't get very far before I just said ""forget it"". My life is too busy for such complexity.",neutral

"I really liked the app and had been using it for a few weeks. But a while ago whenever I would open the app, it would load for a bit but then freeze and crash if I tapped anything. The rest of my phone still works fine (doesn't freeze) while this happens. Is there anything I can do to fix this? I would love to continue using this app. Thank you!

"A intenção é boa, mas a interface é bastante confusa. || The intention is good, but the interface is too confusing",neutral
It is a good application. It is very useful. It is just okay.,neutral
Great app. Needs  a few things like task fail without consequences option. Mostly a full paid version without subscription or in app purchase. Not every one has everything connected to Internet all the time.,neutral
It's such a spectacular idea but I had trouble figuring out all of the different aspects and it was just too much for putting in tasks on a day-to-day basis.,neutral
This is ok!  But it required bunch of upgrade and some new features!  Will keep it! But wait till is it perfect!,neutral
Good but not ok,neutral
"Everything about this app is perfect! Except for the widget support. The widget doesn't update with the new tasks I make in the app. And I wish I could mark tasks as complete right from the widget.

Great start",neutral
Are there any guides out there?,neutral
"Hey, guys! This is good idea! However, I have a feedback for you: Several times I accidentally was clicking task more than once, so I was increasing my level. I didn't found related settings. I think you should make task clickable (checkable, do you get me?) )only once per day, and highlight the finished tasks. This features will prevent accidental checking, therefore increasing level incorrectly. Could you explain me how to use such features, if you already have them??",neutral
It's a pity that your tasks become overdue not according to your system time...,neutral
The concept is good. But why the app is not notifying me about thr task even though I have turned the notification on? This is very bad.,neutral
"The app is good but a FAQ would be appreciated. For example, I cannot find out how to create a group for my tasks.",neutral
"This is unforgivably close to perfect. Why no timer? So many tasks are long-term and need to be chipped away at bit by bit. You could have it where once a task was selected, the timer would start, and you would earn a certain amount of experience and coin for every x amount of minutes completed.  As it is, I have two pair this app with a different promodo app.",neutral
But then it started locking up everytime I tried to load it.  ←ved it until then.,neutral
"I can't be the only one multitasking. Therefore, I don't have time to figure out a basic program. I put in a picture and it was so tiny! I put in my tasks yet some are ""timeless"", some are daily, and there was powerlifting! I'm physically crippled!",neutral
"My settings kept on changing ever time I reopen the app. For example, fear is set to zero, when I open the app again, fear is set to 80. Why? Please fix this. It's getting tiresome to re-do the settings over and over.",neutral
"Its almost what i was looking for apart from is there a way to set how much xp is required to advance in level and how much xp completing a task will give you? E.g. i want to make it so i start at level 40 in benchpress and achieving 91kg will put me at level 41. I will reach level 100 in benchpress by the time i can do 150kg, completing 120kg would put me on level 70 etc.  Otherwise the numbers are just meaningless to me. Really i want to set it up so when i reach my goal in each thing i am at level 100.",neutral
"But can't really test this out since I'm tied with Habitica.  Oh yeah, I personally don't like the avatars though... It'd be nice if to upload your own avatar. Oh, just saw other people suggest the same lol.",neutral
"It really helps with getting things done! Receiving XP, gold and different skills makes uninteresting tasks much easier to do. I like that - on the contrary to other apps - it is actually useful without having to get the premium version. Though the premium version is a nice addition. Suggestion: some rewards could already be existent so you don't have to come up with them yourself. I personally don't have many ideas for coming up with rewards and don't know what gold price would be appropriate.",good
I need help from dev. One of my favorite apps of all time combines scheduling and rpg gaming in one not 5 stars because I bought premium but when I logged into my kindle premium status didnt show up neither did my other data from my phone please help devs!,good
"Nice app with lot of options. Like the reward system. Developper look active as i read the reviews and take comment into consideration. What is fear doing in the task don t really understand. ? Ui could get some work. Not possible to have reminder on ad vitam eternam task. Don t know if possible to have multiple reminder for the same task but would be usefull Maybe a better tutorial, don t like wall of text for tutorial, something more interactive would be nice. Would love to have reward separated per group, for example i am eating healty all week long i can have a burger. I am stopping smoking + do sport i can have a new phone What would motivated me is a picture of my reward that get slowly fullfilled as I get closer to my goal Very expensive app.",good
"I normally don't leave reviews, but I think this app is great!! I love the chart wheel thing! I think it would be cool to set the characteristics and/or skills chart week thing as an option for widget on the phone screen. However, it's been more than a week now since I sent an email to support, and I haven't received any help back concerning my account. Please get back to me as soon as possible! Also I will leave a more nice detailed review in the future once I get into using it more. :)",good
"Just staryed using it. There's a pretty massive learning curve, especially when it comes to the complete customization of your character, characteristics, skills and in general ""finding the flow"" that works for you but so far it's been really helpful and an enjoyable experience.",good
"So far, just setting it up is very easy...for me. The gaming aspect of it is very appealing for the ADHD side of me. I wish I could get the full version but that will have to wait until I get a job. Thank you so much for creating this app.",good
Was really good but I think it'd be even better if it had a widget that could just take up a whole screen and mark complete on tasks from there,good
"My favourite 'to do' app, but the price of subscription is hilarious.",good
Ivery good app.. I would recommend it,good
I like alot about this app but really want to add one thing to make it round out my gamify experience. Skill tree. I would love to be able to lay out and plan how my skills level up and progress into other skills. Linking them together and seeing how the diverge and converge. Some skills may need levels to unlock from other skills or need a basis in 2 skills to be usable. It really would make this app a huge step above any other gasification app.,good
"It's a pretty good app, it makes me want to do tasks unlike other apps.",good
"I absolutely love the app, I've had it for a short time but I know I'll love it. This app helps me keep my day organised and be productive in a fun way! The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is simple.. So much more room for work and improvement in all directions! Keep up the great work! My personal request is a bit of work on the inventory system, as it would be great to keep track of that too. (The need for quest rewards for items is a bit wonky, but my only complaint so far)",good
"Pretty decent but it ignores my default repeat value, and honestly the interface for setting a reminder date/time when creating a new task is clunky and needs to be smoother.",good
I'm loving it so far. Is there any way to switch out the icons with some on the file system?,good
How i add multiple user profile,good
It crashes when you complete a task,good
For me is One of the best ways to do stuff and feel like it has some sort of meaning.,good
"Really a fun and somewhat complex habit tracker to have. Recommendation : you could include some fantasy quests and creatures and some kind of algorithm that uses the skills I made to be used in finishing the quests and fighting creatures, maybe like dice roll mechanics. Would be fun to see your skill in use, cos just building them up isn't enough. Good job, add this quest system and its a complete app. Also app generated loot too...",good
"Regarding the last review, I noticed that multiple widgets of different lists lead to the ""emptied list"" glitch happening more often. Unrelated, but I really love the idea of the new batch action feature. Just wondering why I can't use it to batch fail or batch perform more than one task? I expected that to be the point, but only batch delete and batch skip are available. Batch fail would help with one of the biggest issues to making the app fast to use, which is that failing takes like 3+ taps",good
"I love this app, its helped me quite a bit. I would love to provide 5 stars, but I'm having issues with no notifications even though I have them active and the widget is a bit fussy clearing randomly when I finish a task. I really hope these get fixed because then this will be the single most useful app I've ever used.",good
Allows me take some of the real life out my responsibilities.,good
"Really really, I'm struggling a little bit with some details, but I'm loving so far.",good
Some integrated examples would be nice also an inventory of items to help pick rewards but I have no income so I have to miss out on the good stuff,good
Bom,good
"So far so good, trying to get in to it.",good
Tasks in All tasks group is frequently disappearing & reappearing so kindly fix that bug otherwise app is great,good
Love the way this app is helping me. Its Great feature is the way we can track our own progress because of reward system. 4 stars only because of app's free theme.,good
"Perfect for me, takes some serious investment to set up proberly, but absolutely worth it. However, the impact of skill increases on characteristica is not calculated properly and totally different percentages turn out with the same fraction of exp (or identical numbers with a totally different fraction of the exp). Further more, when i use a task that gives me 100 exp, my herolevel gets stuck at 90/25 and doesnt update anymore. If these minor bugs are fixed, i will provide the 5th star.",good
I love this app. I only wish it had a sort of multiplayer for families to connect accounts.,good
"This app is almost everything I want. I just wish there was more of an RPG element. I played Habitica and it didn't quite scratch that itch either. Maybe something like small quests that utilize text and dice-rolls that can be improved based on your level in different categories. I'd enjoy the hell out of that, and would happily pay for expansions, additional quests/stories, etc.",good
"Really awesome app, I think the best one. The only it lacks web version, since it takes kinda complicated process to create and manage all this tasks and habits. With web version it would be much easier.",good
"It seems good but there is no way for me to increase the ""art"" category. Music and drawing are not the only forms of art. Please change this. Maybe change art to ""crearivity"" but certainly add more creative pursuits so those who cannot draw or do music can increase it. Also aren't erudition and learning really the same thing? My conclusion is that this app is great but needs a lit of work.",good
Strong fallout/ skyrim feel. But full buy price is 45$? Even those games' price are lower on sale. And I bought them on sale. Other sold apps price are usually below 5 dollars. And the default free theme has nice green background but paid ones only have bright white background?? I don't sub apps I buy them.Sub is for something like Netflix and Spotify...,good
"add check system, count system ( how many times) and timer ( count down and count up).. then no need to use other apps...Tnx",good
"This app is very good for keeping on task, and everything is totally customizable. One thing I would improve is the simplisity of it. Right now, it's a bit too much to handle, and if there was an easier way to do things, it would make this app even greater!",good
"I have enjoyed navigating my way around the set up so far, definitely worth a subscription for the full experience. Shared it with friends but unfortunately it's only available on Android. One major issue though is I can't select the quantity to use for consumables. If you decided to put in 1,000 credits in there, you'll have to click 3,000 times to use it. Takes the fun out of it. Also, wish it had a web page version like Habitica so everyone can share the experience regardless of their OS.",good
I'll give it five stars when the widget stops resetting to nothing after I alter things within the app. I have to delete it off of my screen and put it back on in order for it to update.,good
I love this app and use it on my Android phone. Now I have an iPad and cannot find this app for it. Is there an iOS version available?,good
Good.,good
"THE POP-UP AFTER U CONCLUDE A TASK IS VERY EXHAUSTIVE. IF U TAKE OFF THESE THE APP WOULD BE PERFECT. AND ALSO IF U STAY A DAY WITHOUT DOING THE TASKS, THE APP GOES CRAZY AND STOP PLACING THE TASKS CORRECT",good
"Great idea, really creative and love thr preset activities that offer guidance",good
"in primo luogo, adoro... voglio dire, una lista che mi faccia giocare ed avanzare di livello come in un rpg... non posso fare altro che adorare tanterrimo in secondo luogo: probabilmente esiste un modo per impostare orari per le attività (lezioni, cose così), altrimenti non avrebbe senso poter impostare un allarme, ma... hem... io non ho idea di come si faccia (help me please) cosa numero tre: ho provato a cercarne una versione adattabile per pc e non sembra esserci... sarebbe bellissimo se ci fosse e (magari) fosse sincronizzabile ultima cosa e poi la pianto: esiste un modo per creare traguardi composti da più traguardi? mi piacerebbe avere un megaobbiettivo laurea composto dei vari esami... o campagne composte di varie sessioni...",good
"Slightly Intuitive, should have a tutorial. Other than that, loving it since I love rpg's!",good
"app has improved a lot since initial launch and it's still my go-to for my daily tasks! still hoping for more social features in the future. also, there is still the lingering issue with a surprising amount of battery use, i think it's still related to the amount of tasks i have (i have a very busy schedule), and it causes my phone to overheat. keep up the good work!",good
"I absolutely love this app. I am using for a couple weeks and it is really helping me with my tasks. I tried similar apps and they're not quite as good. Tasks are highly customisable and gives tons of options. So why not 5 stars? Well, there are some issues, but please take them as constructive criticism. 1. It is not respecting the silence mode. 2. Steep learning curve. (Worth it though) 3. Auto failing task with subtask is not working. I will promptly give 5 starts when #1 is fixed!!!",good
"Personally, taking the time to translate my every task into RPG format is tedious. Pretty time consuming in terms of customization. It's more like an RPG Maker, but to-do style. It's not what I'm looking for but given the developers perspective it's excellent for what it's worth. Flexible, extremely customizable and full of possibilities. Suggestion: allowing to download other users formats they've already taken the time to create.",good
"Great, but have some issues with the tasks list widget. No way I can complete a task on it without its disappearing",good
Great creative idea that does help keep me on track. I've also used it to start new good habits!,good
"It's a good app, looks polished and nice. Only problem I have is I have some tasks that repeat themselves even after I complete them, I've editted that they only come once a day but forever stay on the today tasks",good
Good app. Minus a star as you cant manually sort task lists with your finger and change their priority that way,good
I've really enjoyed the app and has been very helpful. although to me the app seems like it's not fully finished. I wish the stats you were building actually did something in game. the money also seems kind of pointless. I can buy items that I create but they just adjust your stats which I could easily accomplish through tasks,good
It is a lot better than the other apps out. An 8 or 16bit UI makeover would be dope. The pixel look and feel. Always nostalgic,good
"Haven't used it much but so far I enjoy the idea. I would like to suggest adding a notification every so often option. For example, I'm wanting to do 12 pushups every hour, every day, 10 hours a day.",good
"A bit underrated. It's a fun way to get things done, kind of like having a video game character. It does take time to set up and some unnecessary options cost money, but it makes getting stuff done feel more rewarding. Good app for parents to set up for their kids as well so they are more motivated and enjoy getting chores, homework, etc, done. :-)",good
"It's a great app and very useful, but I would like for it to add an options. ""Delete after completion."" This means it would repeat until you hit the check button.",good
"App has definitely improved since my last review! more social features would be really cool. i am subscribed and i would love to see where this app takes off. i have noticed recent stability issues when i'm on the app for a prolonged period. not sure if it's related to the amount of tasks i have, as i use this app for basically all my tasks, including birthdays. the app will slow down and nearly crash after awhile. otherwise, this is still my go-to! 4 stars again!",good
"This is a great app for anybody needing some extra motivation or a way to organize their life. I've had some trouble editing or deleting reoccurring tasks, but this may be a device issue, I'm not sure.",good
Works as expected but I would like for time customisation to be more flexible and precise,good
It been running kind of slow when you're making new tasks,good
"Add ""negative habits"" which when done decrease coin, xp etc.",good
Nice app. Bug with achievement exp gained. It only adds on to current hero exp without leveling up eg( 144exp/25exp ). Why does skill decay even after doing a task that increases it?,good
"Тарас это крутая идея и хорошая реализация. Доставляет кайф возможность разбивать дэйлики на подпункты (будет чётко если добавишь возможность автозавершения после выполнения всех пунктов). Система ачивок вполне юзабельно но нужно устанавливать ачивки на ""Habit generate"" - по типу 30 дней без перерыва и при желании по возрастающей 3 месяца и т. д Nexus 5x lineages OS 15.1 не работают reminders. Не готов брать подписку, но если добавишь отдельный платный контент (иконки или журнал квестов) - куплю",good
It's helping me the way i think,good
"Неплохое приложение для поднятия своей дисциплины в игровой форме. Перейдем к минусам: - Дорого за полную версию Серьёзно, 3400 рублей за полную версию навсегда - это очень дорого! Мне кажется, что автор случайно дописал лишний ноль, 340 - ладно, 3400 - дрого. - Не всё доступно без полной версии... Это немного относится к первому минусу. Теперь плюсы: + Повышение дисциплины в игровой форме: Например, если быть чесным и выставлять адекватные награды, то всё очень классно!",good
"I am liking it, the subscription model is a bit steep and harsh, especially for the full buy out at 50+ dollars. A suggestion, I'd like to see two categories under the ""Skills"", one that says ""Increasing"" and one that says ""Decreasing"". I am trying to set up a ""Daily Grind"" negative skill that decreases ""Will Power"" and ""Motivation"", while increasing ""Submission"" and ""Routine"". I've noticed the Dev team is really good at responding, so I am hopeful for a response. Thanks!",good
I really enjoy this app because it stops me from sitting on my butt 24/7.,good
"It's helpful, but it's also annoying. Edit: I didn't make it clear enough, it's annoying to realize how much I'm failing lol Anyway the app is pretty good I'm just overly sensitive and self criritcal",good
Homescreen widget would be nice with more display option such as the progress bar.. etc,good
"Good App. Lots of customization. But i have noticed an issue with repeating sub-tasks. If a subtask is set to repeat, it won't complete the main task. Seems to complete fine if the subtasks are not set repeat.",good
"I like this app, but it really annoys me that it defaults to playing a chime when you first pick up your phone in the morning. When just checking the time, I don't want to be woken up even more. I wish it were possible to just disable that notification instead of disabling all sounds from the app at once.",good
Awesome,good
I really like the app. I'm having an issue though where the widget doesn't populate when a new day starts. I have to delete it and readd it or restart my phone.,good
"I think it's a great app, and a lot of fun. I had some trouble figuring things out at first, but everything works. The only complaint I would have is the cost... It would be nice to have some of the features, but they are too expensive.",good
"The app is allready great. The amount of customisation is surreal and with a bit of tweaking you can really make it work. The sentimental value you create this way really helped me grow. As the app is rpg themed, those elements could be further enhanced imo. I think a customisable character would be fun. More options to spend the currency other then personalised awards is what im getting at. This way you really build something with the effort you've put in. For the games.. Keep up the good work",good
"This app is great! I love the idea of turning my daily life like an RPG game. But I have this goal to wash my face twice everyday and it feels repetitive to make two task for the exact same thing. So can you guys make a task where it has to be done twice before the said task is completed? Been trying my hardest to do this on your app, even finished reading the user guide, but it still wouldn't work.",good
I really like it. I think it's a really cool concept to have characters to build up with the habits. Only thing I wish were there is to be able to have notifications for term less habits,good
"The app is good and in general highly customizable, but it has one flaw: it uses days (24 hours periods) as a basic unit of measure, but it doesn't let you change the default starting hour (midnight). This is inconvenient for people who have unusual working hours and it makes the app impractical to track daily tasks for users who are more productive at night. I would rate it as a 5 stars app, if I could choose when my day ends and be able to log my dailies properly.",good
Turn life into a game! Create your own tasks and assign value to them! Pretty cool eh?,good
"Nice. Will be better if app has got inhabit counter.. for example count of pushups or exercise. I need it, but app is very nice. I will be recommend it.",good
"It is a cool app, but the calendar feature required to be bought. That should be informed to the users before installation. In addition, it would be a good idea if skills can increase over time, and skills can decrease characteristics.",good
Great honestly great way to keep track of daily tasks to stay organized. One thing they should add is overall goals. And tasks leading to those goals.,good
"Interesting concept! Still getting used to the functionality, but this app is an effective way to gamify your to-do and task lists. Before Do it Now -RPG, I had a list of chores; Now I have a quest-list, instead. Time to go unlock some achievements!",good
"This app is so robust, I love it! However, I would love a quick add button in the notifications.",good
"I just started but really like it so far. Competes directly with Habitica but less of the nonsense costumes. It's hard at first to sort characteristics, skills and tasks (you are essentially your own game dev) but on paper I recently sorted out what I want to improve (Skills) and what is stopping me (Characteristics). Tasks will follow soon after. I'm really hopeful about this setup, I love the design, and I never do this but I might actually pay for a subscription (!!!) if all goes well.",good
"Perfect for people who want to get organized and desire an app more robust than a checklist. It has profound customization ability. The reward system is more complex than competitors. For someone with significant attention issues, this has really helped me to feel invested. Subtasks and autofails are great features. Would be 5 stars if developers: 1. Allowed subtasks to renew as collapsible tasks not just tied in 2. Made tutorial/videos. Full functionality will be a learning curve for many",good
Looking forward to a better UI/UX. Will keep using it.,good
Just after I looked at the interface I knew it was what I was searching. Not so for the xp thing which is a very great idea but also how it handle goals like reading books... For anyone who think in terms of goals (and obviously who love RPGs) It's totally free though,good
Its a good app for everyday tasks. It takes time to customize it and its normal because its an RPG type. However I think im not the only one who encountered this annoying bug where if you want to change a task from lets say termless to always repeat every day the task remains termless. You can solve this problem by deleting the task and making another with the setting you want. This bug was very frustrating because i thought i did something wrong but yeah..,good
COMPLETE! A tip: The task option directly reduces the characteristics rather than just the ability,good
"I would love to do a one/life time purchase for this app. Too bad I hate subscription based so sorry, I'd rather spend my money for something unproductive than this app.",good
"I was looking for an organizer app which would provide statistics on my discipline and progress, and this does it! But it is missing one, to me basic, feature - the tasks don't have a start time or duration period, there is only a deadline. It doesn't allow understanding easily whether the tasks overlap in time. Is this feature available in the premium version at least? Another missing feature is the location setting, at least at a home/work/outdoors level. Any plans to incorporate the features?",good
The app has a way of motivating you to complete tasks.,good
It keeps reminding me even after the Task is done and it was adjusted according to how many times I should be notified. But overall nice app.,good
Treating activities like a game Gives me a sense of accomplishment when I successfully finish my duties and earn XP.,good
"Awesome app to keep your life on track. Would 5 star, but app crashes every time I try and add a custoum sound. Edit: Thank you! Will try again after the next update.",good
"I've been using this app for some weeks now. There are still some features that I don't understand and there's just so much available for customisation that it's overwhelming. But, once i spent a few hours customizing all i wanted, this app has been so fun and useful. Most to do list apps out there are so cumbersome and anxiety inducing. This one isn't. It has helped me prioritize what's important to me while letting me role-play. I like it a lot.",good
"Pretty easy to use and reliable. Still trying to figure out the ins and outs, but it's been fairly easy to pick up.",good
Good,good
The apps are functioning well and recommended trying for RPG theme if you love RPG 👍but there is a problem where sometimes when i added the task it does not appear at the task section and sometimes it becomes duplicate..,good
Very interesting application just to complicated for me,good
"(+)Pros: it's fun, LOTS of customisation, ALL basic functionality are free, inclined to habit generation than everyday to do list. (-)Cons: first time setup are quite challenging; literally create your own system. Icons & themes are limited (minor inconvenience). I was using LifeRPG (which seems abandoned now) so it helps with the learning curve. I see devs made lots improvement here. Recommended!",good
"Hello. This app is great, but I have a suggestion. With the inventory items, please make it so you can give them attribites such as +10% xp gain or +10% gold gain, or just +10% xp for a specific skill.",good
Nice,good
This app looks to carry the torch from the now abandoned LifeRPG app and from a bit of digging so far I'm impressed. Some things are tucked behind a pay wall such as the calendar and aesthetic additions like themes and icons but it's a relatively low price and helps support the devs so I'll probably bite on that once I've set up everything and used the app a bit. One suggestion I'd have is to implement geotagged triggers for events - like bringing up a reminder when I'm near the gym or store.,good
Jibj,good
"it would be nice if there are pre-set goals or task to choose from - while the app allow for a high level of customization, it's too much hassle to set it all up properly, not to mention balancing the reward from each task",good
It٬s one of the best liferpg apps i have ever seen with lot of options but it can have some more beautiful transparent widgets and if you add an option that a task directly influences a characteristics it can be more comfortable,good
"definetly a 4 star. good app, good concepts some bugs, not really pulling me in thou. i forgot about it, which was sort of the point of the app to make me not forget it. so 4 stars.",good
fun and productive,good
"I bought the full version. its a fun app to challenge yourself. I would like to see an update gives you the choice to choose a pen or pencil icon or a book icon, which seem to be missing, that would be useful. for example, if you want to write a book, it would be nice to have a ""book""📚📗📘📙📓📔icon, or ""pen""🖋🖊 icon, or ""pencil"" icon... UPDATE: I seem them now! Thanks for responding and letting me know. Looks like I needed to scroll farther down to see them. 👍",good
easy to use and good at keeping me motivated throughout the day,good
Crashes when I customize my hero status,good
"I downloaded this game in the Hope's that the format would help me with my procrastination and can I just say, its exceeded my expectations. it's so good ! I ended up having to change some of the pre set tasks and rewards to make it more personalized but apart from that, it's great. highly recommend if you, like me, like to procrastinate and make excuses to avoid tasks.",good
"Its really useful i really wish it had a way to add people so you could submit tasks for eachother, or a way to access it on a computer or browser.",good
"It's a lot of fun, good personalization. I have to make time to explore the app called more fully, I think a tutorial would be amazing, and pre-developed lists that could be tweaked.",good
Fantastic app but 4 stars. Every part has been a comfortable experience for me until I started trying to use it across devices. I took me around 30 minutes to set up all my tasks the first time and when I signed into my account for the app all the tasks I had made got overwritten by the default tasks from the other device. It was partially my fault for the careless order that I signed in on the devices. But perhaps my issue could have been avoided entirely if when it attempted to sync my tasks from the internet the first time it asked me if I wanted to use the database that is from the internet or that is local. Would have saved me a lot of headache remaking all the tasks again. That said every other function provided is great and I would recommend.,good
"New user and I'm impressed! A lot of neat features I've been looking for in apps like this. it's obvious dev is active and listening and thats a great sign. If I have an immediate suggestion, it'd be for us to be able to add tab categories of traits besides the default characteristics/skills; for example to add things like ""personality"", ""lifestyle"" or however we want to organize our skillset categories, so those 2 sections aren't cluttered. A search option for icons too maybe? Keep it up!",good
"Life changing app with a great concept, but still needs some work.",good
"Liking it a lot so far, but I don't get it doesn't give a warning ring before tasks I put in. That's kind of the main thing I need it for - to remind me of tasks I had previously put in.",good
Fun and easy to use. Creative and helpful way to track tasks and habits.,good
"one thing, the widget sometimes doesn't update the today list, and about the to do list, i have to make 2 different widget for today and tommorow, because when all tasks show, cannot differentiate what today and tommorow so i was check list my today and tommorow task, and it is kinda confusing how to uncheck again (?) maybe this option to check and uncheck must be there, and the reward will be given after all the task has done for today.. thank you, hope this app improve",good
I can't sign in neither with my google account nor with gmail. should I do something to be able to do that? or it's just a bug?,good
"i really like the app, but I don't know if I'm using it to its fullest potential. Has any on made a tutorial?",good
Simple and straightforward,good
"This app is really good. I want to suggest to that the app should have a ""Rest Day"" option or something similar. That you can activate it anytime you want and while activated, the tasks will be put into a halt including penalty and overdue. It is useful if you are on vacation or there's an occasion you need to attend and makes you unable to finish the daily tasks.",good
this is pure magic juat saying best life app out there keep up the great work!!! im ao happy you listen to your customers EDIT: now my entire household is using this app its amazing magic easy to use only thing i noticed is that when you claim a reward if it has an increasing cost sometimes it will spend the gold after the increase instead of before resulting in extra gold loss my best guess is that the script might be changing the cost value before subtracting the gold from the players gold.,good
"Hello! Your app is amazing! My GF and me installed this app 2 days ago and started to planning task to each other. But i really need a list functional, like add a shopping list or some book list to add in this app. Are you going to add this? Sry for my English, btw:) UPDATE: And i really need a functional to add a checklist in tasks with possibility to mark it's completed. Thank you and your team again for this great app!",good
"It's a bit hard to set everything up, but it's a fun new concept for the typical agenda that encourages you a bit more to achieve your goals through a rpg style. Nice work dev team. Thanks for your time and effort.",good
eu daria 5 se estivesse totalmente traduzido para português,good
"This app is great overall, I just wish there were categories for your inventory items and that the task list widget showed your profile icon also, the profile icon has very bad quality when you choose your own :/",good
Keeps me on track!,good
"I like it, and I would definitely pay £20 for it, but I cant justify paying a subscription. if only I could pay once.",good
"All it needs is the option to set a pic from the gallery as an icon. If that happens in the next update, I'll give 5 stars!",good
Notifications fixed. App keeps getting better. I'd like to suggest being able to use habit generation as an unlock condition for achievements. Edit: Nice :D Another thing I would suggest is add the date when an achievement was unlocked (example: unlocked 01/04/2019) so we can also order them by this date when looking the unlocked tab. Thanks for this app!,good
"Great app for setting up to do list and setting skills, very similar to LifeRPG, differing only in UI and the addition of achievements in my opinion. Stuck with the other one of the basis of not wanting to pay a subscription for an app. Would prefer one off payment to unlock features.",good
needs more ranks.,good
"Productivity gamefied! As has been said before, the natural successor to LifeRPG. Looks like they just ripped the source code tbh, but it irons out many of its predecessors bugs. Pity they monetised it in every available orifice, fukugly full screen ads, in-app purchases for trivial customisations and an absurdly extortionate subscription, all conspire to overshadow the app itself, as does the uninspired graphic design and the use of unexciting headings that detract from its ""gaming"" USP.",good
"A good app in general. I would love to be able to have ""loose"" tasks, for example: practice spanish twice a week. Which should be completed at least twice every week. Also, why not allow icons to be any emoji?",good
"It's pretty nice all things considered, but I have found a few problems with it. mostly the fact that the notifications do not work and by that I mean no matter how many notify alarms I set, none of them go off. I've downloaded this app on several occasions in the past and I've had the same problems each time. The second is that the widget will (quite often) display that I have no tasks when I in fact have about seven on any given day. I'm not taking a star off because of the widget though.",good
"It's a great app, keep up the good work! It has almost all features I've ever wished for in gamification. But a few things were missing/quite annoying for me and lead me to abandon this app for now. If it helps you I could write you a comprehensive list of enhancements and features that I think could make this app better. Here's not enough space for that, though. Please give a short answer of you'd like me to send you an email with the list of my thoughts. :)",good
"I liked the app very much, I signed up and so with the hope that my to do list would sync with all devices. But when I reinstalled the up after cleaning my phone, everything disappeared. 😢",good
"No bad habits to simply punish me, just could make good habits?",good
"Looks cool and I like the stats. I would like to have a monthly and yearly calendar display on which dates with non-repeating tasks scheduled are bold or otherwise highlighted, or preferably have the tasks listed in small font in the box for that day in monthly view. And when you click on the date have all tasks for that day display. Why do none of the life rpg apps I've tried not have calendars? It's bothersome to add something to a calendar and then open up another app and add it in again.",good
So far so good. I love creating my own adventure. Still learning some of the functions. Maybe a tips video could help. I can't wait to see what other fun things can be added. More community or friends list. Or leader board. Then get us to do in app purchases for new items or level streaks. I just like this a bunch. So thank you!,good
"Seems like a very good idea but how can i edit what i've done the previous day? Eg. If its Tuesday, it seems to be impossible to edit achievements from Monday (which seems like a perfect thing do to on Tuesday morning ;) )",good
"A very good rip-off of LifeRPG—taking all of the useful features of task management, reward motivation, and RPG-style stat levels, and making the UI simpler and more user-friendly. Seems to be monetizing the idea though, putting in ads and lots of in-app purchases and requiring a RECURRING payment subscription rather than one-time purchase to unlock features",good
"Good concept. But I don't use the app anymore. as someone who is now not really a gamer, the point game-like concept seems to doesn't work for me anymore and maybe it's also due to the fact that I only compete with my self. if I were to compete with a friend or whoever that is, maybe I can keep my self accountable. But that's it to it. If you are a gamer, this app might gonna help you.",good
This would have been a 5 star to app if it wasnt for one miner problem I didn't like. You can't choose PM or AM times and it's just a annoying and confusing.,good
I like this app. I only used it for 5 mins and there are no adverts that ruin your experience. I hope that the developers will continue working on it so that the app will be improved. I would consider paying for the premium features too if the app is good enough.,good
I really like it. I wish the icon could be custom made. For example IF I could use my own png files as icons that would be cool. Especially for achievements.,good
Why this app consumes so MUCH traffic in background? This month it hit the 500mb (!!!) in bg. Is this app free of malware elements?,good
"You add execution note but when I check in history it just one word that appeared, and the next is ........, I confuse how to check the details. Hope the next update, there is detail preview when tap a mission that's done in history. And also search feature in history will be very useful to check some mission among all those missions in history. Thank you for great app.",good
Fun way to track and reward yourself guilt-free. Lots of personal calibration but the interface is nice. My only problem is the lack of icons even in the premium section.,good
"Update: Thank you for the fix, also if possible, can you consider adding an 
icon (a way) for quickly go to subtasks? (It helps User Experience a lot 
because now, we need to click / hold 2 times for go to subtasks of a parent 
task, and it takes a lot of time for the tasks with many level. I already 
update the rating, please let me know your feedback for the above and when 
the new update is available, i will change it to 5 stars Regards, ----- 
Please fix the ""Add subtasks"" feature in Subtasks list of a parent task 
(When clicking on ""Edit"" icon, it show list of subtasks to select, and a 
""Add subtasks"" link, but click on it show nothing) -> It affects User 
Experience a lot because when we need to add subtasks, we need to ""back"" a 
lot to go to main task list -> then add normal task -> then go to parent 
task to mark it as subtask Thank you. It is urgent so please let me know 
your feedback then I will increase the rating",good
"Reward section should be devided into multiple catagory like item, armor, 
food etc to avoid difficulty in selecting one we want to buy with gold.. or 
you could add the feature to add a tast to costomable group we can create..",good
"I like this update.. however i still think this app could be better in UI.. 
in future, could you add the visual improvement like adding progress bar in 
each characteristics and skills so we can track our progress more fun.. 
also just suggestions you could add health and magic point like in real RPG 
game.. alot people would like that i guess..",good
"Great app, not as streamlined, but ever so flexible. A couple of annoyances I have with the app are the lack of icons (even after purchasing the locked icons). And the lack of color coding/grouping on the overview.",good
Excellent features but needs more exciting UI,good
"I quite enjoyed this amazing little app for a week then I realized I can't 
view my past before like 6 days, if I could save it somewhere in graph form 
that would've been the 5th star.",good
"It's a good app, but it would be better if more optiosns were added in the 
repeat section, like being able to choose the repeat to occur every 
second/third/etc day/week/etc",good
So what is.the function of coins?,good
"This is a great app. The organization options are perfect for what I want to do. I put each room of my house in as a daily bonus quest and add each task I need to do as a subtask.   That way I can see the tasks needed for each room at a glance and give myself a nice bonus for full completion.  My only complaint is that you can't set a custom reset or rollover time. It's always at midnight local time. Sometimes I like to lay in bed and check off all the chores I did before falling asleep, and if it's past midnight it becomes a pain to fix.  Would be great if the option for custom reset time was added.",good
"Would give it full stars but the app crashes as soon as I open it now (so I can't use it), hoping that will be fixed in an update :) Edit: for some reason I can access the app through the widget and edit the tasks but as soon as I try to click the home page it fails to load and crashes",good
"I love most of this. The initial setup is a bear of a thing, but once that's done it is very satisfying to use. As with all task management apps, I wish you could have tasks repeat on only certain days of the week (e.g. weekdays or M/W/F). The first app to do that will make bank.",good
"Does this app has a web version yet? If so, then i'll definitely use it more~!",good
"Really like this app, I've found it really useful... would have been 5 stars but I've started having problems with adding skills to tasks with some of them not appearing after saving/updating...this does affect the game aspect and relevant skill increases.",good
First app to actually motivate me.   Only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that the achievements have no automatic templates and can't be set with conditions connected to the auto-fail function. That would be great for building habits.,good
I love everything! I just want the XP bar to have a cool animation of actually filling up in front of me!!! It's the only reasons I still use RPG life...I know it's petty...but animations are important for an app,good
Like it so far! My only suggestion being a shop where you can buy icons or something. Gotta put use for the coins,good
"Excellent for what it advertises. I wish for a way to spend the gold or use the exp. that way it would provide incentive to ""play"" more for those who wish to use this app as intended.",good
"This app has helped me so much with motivating myself. I'm very ill and doing simple daily tasks like eating and taking meds is exhausting. This app has made it easy to track when I meet my daily goals and helps motivate me to do the things I need to take care of myself. My only dissatisfaction with this app is that you cannot edit failed tasks. On many occasions my goals have timed out because of the auto-fail feature, and even though I have done the task and thought I told the app I had done the task the app tells me I failed the goal. Once the task is failed, there's no way to edit the failed task. It's really upsetting when I've done the work, but my goal is marked as failed. For now, I think I will stop using the auto fail feature.",good
"I really like all the features in this app, but what I have two problems with this app: Simplicity and Customization. The app lacks simplicity in that it's a bit hard to get started. I create a task, and I'm introduced to Skills, which introduce me to",good
This app so far has the cleanest ui of all the apps ive tried of this genre. The task set up is so quick to use and the duplicate feature??? Fantastic for someone like me who has to set up working out tasks with similar outlines. The one thing I'd say is additional icons and maybe a few templates to help people get started other than the default. Otherwise keep up the good work!,good
I really like the idea of this app. It's pretty easy to use and understand and if you liked D&D growing up it'll remind you of the character building/levelling processes (which is great). If I could make one suggestion; add a falconry guy to the avatars. 😉,good
"Great app, a funny way of keeping your life organized. I would suggest some better graphics (more icons for tasks are definitely needed), a HP bar to show how much time is left before sleeping (which should be an adjustable parameter) and an inventory feature to store your purchased rewards without immediately using them - when used, they would disappear from inventory and maybe appear in the 'claimed' section. Thanks for the hard work, keep it up! I will give 5 stars for sure as soon as these features are implemented (:",good
"Great app, only thing that needs work is the achievement tab, it's pretty lackluster, you can't make achievements for reach (x) level overall like giving yourself an achievement for reaching level 5 as a hero not only for skills/carachteristics how it is currently, would change to 5 stars if this gets fixed",good
Achievements should have reward options such as exp/gold.   Otherwise it is a neat app.,good
"I've previously written a review as well as updated it, which I will continue to do - I believe in this app's potential.  One of the more persistent problems I've faced is with skill point distribution. Sometimes when I go to check the related skills of a repeating task (because I'm not seeing the related skill points on-screen upon completion), I notice that the related skills percentages have been reset. I have to manually change the percentages back which can be pretty time consuming, especially when it keeps happening. I really wish the devs would fix that.  Also, a suggestion: I would love to see time/date for my tasks in the widget and notification windows.",good
"Приложение хорошее, однако было бы неплохо добавить календарь, чтобы можно было более наглядно просматривать записи на послезавтра, послепослезавтра, 31 февраля и т. д. А также было бы неполохо добавить срок выполнения задачи в течении определенного периода, а не только на конкретную дату.",good
"Autofailed tasks should be more intuitive. They don't actually fail until you visit your task list, and if you failed them yesterday the points for the day you failed them don't go to that day, they go to the current day. So because I slacked off yesterday, I'm starting today with like -20 gold on my chart! That's not fair and it skews the stats. If I didn't do something yesterday, I want it to show that I didn't do something /yesterday/. And when I autofail a task it should alert me with a notification, or at least as soon as I open it to the home screen. And tasks should be able to be set to just autofail at midnight without having to fiddle with the current more involved settings.",good
"Great app, but when are they going to make some Ice Hockey icons???",good
"UPD: Пожалуйста, добавьте возможность уходить в минус по итогам заваленных миссий! Получается нечестно, что я батонюсь, пропускаю задания, а потом мне не нужно отдавать за них долги 😈 Очень мешает золотая иконка монеток, не вписывается в дизайн. Сделайте ее, пожалуйста, в одном стиле с приложением (только не меняйте на алмазы 😰).  P. S.: купила тему, чтобы немножко поддержать вас, очень жду заявленного обновления!  ______ Перешла к вам с LifeRPG, очень не хватает функции добавления иконок для миссий (в идеале - кастомных, с галереи) и родительских/дочерних миссий (хотя с ними сопряжено большинство багов 😅). Мне очень нравится приложение, а главное, его отзывчивый разработчик, я продолжу пользоваться, спасибо!",good
A bit of headache in beginning.. but awesome!,good
"It was great while it worked! Fell in love with this app, but after maybe a week of using... it stopped working. A bug perhaps, but when I went to add tasks it froze and didn't let me do anything, and even deleting and reinstalling didn't help. I'm sad that I have to replace this app. I really did like it a lot.",good
Great app. An alarm would be great with new or better icons in context with the app,good
I really like the idea and would of easily voted 5 on it but it has no alerts or alarms on mine to remind me to do the set task. Doesn't even send me a notification.,good
This is a good app for motivation,good
"I like the app as a to do list. However, it needs an AM or PM function on the time.",good
"I believe it's awesome. But for the next update can you please use "" : "" instead of "" - "" in front of numbers? It looks like a minus symbol!",good
It was fantastic until it started freezing every time I went to tasks. Is there a way to fix this?,good
"I'm only a few days in but it seems to be working! Only complaint so far is that it would be good to have the xp show on the task list next to the task, or have the gold reward automatically scale with the xp so I have motivation to do the harder (for me.) Tasks without having to work out how much gold I think it is worth.",good
"Although a very useful app, I would like it to have a more medieval RPG theme to it, rather than the modern theme that it currently has. I would also like to be able to set some skills and characteristics to decrease over time.  Aside from that, the app is great.",good
Love the app! I wish there were more features such as adding icons to tasks or adding a quest map.,good
Widget finished task should be gone. It bother me that it's still with my task at hand.,good
Nice app best of the ones ive tried. But really think about adding some graphics and a much less boring UI (look at SuperBetter for instance) also a 'multiplayer' aspect is a glaring omission that almost all your competitors have..  Try to have stats actually have some meaning or  a way for us to give them meaning.,good
"Edit: For some reason, the timezone of the app is not the same as my actual timezone. Tasks are ""overdue"" even though the day is not over for me... However, it's still a great app with lots of potential! I like the slick interface and the whole concept. Once you can differentiate the characteristics from the skills, the fun begins. Keep improving this app, it's definitely my favorite RPG lifestyle app.",good
Could we customize notification sound for successful tasks? I want to add final fantasy victory theme but still don't know how to... Besides that i really like this apps..,good
"As someone that has played several MMORPGs I'm excited to use this. I made my first task for cleaning the kitchen and worded it in a way you'd find in an RPG quest simply for self amusement. I think it would be a really cool update to have our 'hero' icon image start off as a type you'd see in an RPG such as ranger, mage, or paladin (and maybe even more to pick from) in novice armor related to their character type and as the hero goes up in mastery their armor would get better.",good
"Just work on the notifications, they are working rather strange and add some better visualization.",good
"Hi im using Nexus 5X. As a gamer i definitely like it. However, nowadays while i'm checking/making task the app always crash/not responding. I only rate 4stars because of it. Kindly fix. Thanks!",good
By far the most in-depth app of this style. Tried Habitica and others and they were so underdeveloped in comparison in my opinion.,good
"This app is very customizable, which I definitely wanted in an RPG style To Do list. However, it does come at a cost, since getting everything set up how you'd like takes much longer than similar apps. Personally I think the trade is worth it (hence my rating), but be aware that if you're looking for something more simple, this probably isnt the app for you. If you want to really determine exactly how you want things to work, pick this one over the others!",good
"It would be nice to have the ability to set an xp/coins decay until a particular task is completed. Also, would be nice to be able to more easily schedule an existing infinite repitition task for a particular time (rather than editing its time and resetting it, or duplicating it). Also, maybe add search ability for filtering icons (as there are so many).",good
"The most fully-featured task tracking app I've seen. A little daunting at first, I recommend ignoring a lot of the xp sliders and special options until you are used to the general mechanics. Once you realize you can ignore or tweak any mechanics you dislike, it's value shines through. There's enough options in the mechanics that you can use what systems you like and ignore the rest.",good
Great software for those who want to succeed I have been using this software for a year and I am completely satisfied with it Install it right now,good
Perfect. I serched to many apps like this but finally i find you. Best app for upgrade your life. U are my hero and i am a premium User now. Thank you dear Dev. ♡,good
Really helps me to keep motivated to keep my workouts or chores. And its so easy to use,good
Best app,good
"Good app... Relatively easy, with out being too simplistic... Rpg aspects are engaging but not excessively time consuming! Calendar is 'paid access', which is a little annoying, but certainly understandable... Popup ads are mostly brief (as should be), and far enough between, they are acceptable enough... All in all, best 'RPG ToDo list' I've tried...!",good
"wow! I've only had this for a few hours, but I love all the features, and I think this is going to be super helpful. amazing app, I will definitely be upgrading to pro at some point",good
"Been using it for a few days now, has really helped me focus on and organize tasks, even simple ones like making the bed or brushing my dog, things I always skip at least a couple times a week. Don't even really feel the need to get the pro version because of how useful the free one is.",good
"You have to spend some time setting up everything such that it fits your goals and your personality etc. ., but it's worth the effort",good
"Just what I was looking for. Simple, logic, no unnecessary filling functions. Great design.",good
"Awesome reminder app. This one actually motivates you to complete tasks because it shows you your progress and the ui is easy to use. It's very customizable, from being able to choose the icon of a task to allowing you to create an unlimited number of tasks. The free version also allows the use of almost all of its features and doesn't hinder you in any way. I'm considering getting a subscription, but mostly because I want to support the creators of the app that has improved my daily life.",good
"Love it, the game element to it really gives me motivation to complete my tasks. I can create loads of tasks and give myself rewards to work todays. Really cool 🙌",good
"This has been the most straight forward gamify your life app. I love that it lets you add your own skills and have a task increase or decrease a skill. I also like that it allows you add your own pictures for each different level that you advance as you fulfill your taks Improvements needed would be to explain the metrics, percentages and other customization that is not entirely clear how to use",good
I love this app. Life is like a game for me and this application helps to improve myself in a fun way.,good
Love the app and the fact the devs listen and add new updates all the time,good
I just started the app a few days ago and I really like it. I told my kids it would have been nice to have this when they were young. The fight for chores might have been a little less of a struggle.,good
Great so far,good
"So far, it's a great way to keep track of daily tasks and stay motivated on self-care",good
Great app! It helped me get my life together.,good
This app has been life changing. Its perfect for people who are Strategic and motivated by growing as a person.,good
"Love it, incredibly useful and I feel like a superhero growing in a gamification style system that tracks my lifestyle and productivity... Great product. The only thing I need is an online opportunity, it is hard to use the interface exclusively on the phone because it is such an interactive interface, this would really expand on the product usage, I can't pull my phone out at work, but could open a website.",good
Excelente app e com possobilidades infinitas se você for criativo,good
"Absolutely love it! This is by far the greatest app for gamification, i use this app to implement new and creative ideas in Notion. I wonder if the developers know about notion and gamification setup in notion. It has been a huge help.",good
"Tried 3 top rated (at time), as once a 'pen & paper' Dungeon Master, I found this app to be a nice blend of functionality and fantasy... The interface is user friendly, and sub-screens are nicely inter-connected, easy to navigate. Would benefit from a little more initial guidance, particularly with specific intended use of the various 'percentage settings' and 'groups & sub tasks, but, overall, so far very happy!! Wish calendar wasn't 'paid', but certainly understand! So far, no obnoxious ads...",good
Великолепное приложение. Отзывчивая поддержка. Отличный дизайн. Продуманная и удобная система развития. Очень интересно ставить себе и родным задачи и вознаграждение за них. Рекомендую.,good
I really like this app. I appreciate how much thought has been put into it but it is complicated app. I wish there was a video to understand all features even though the help document is quite thorough.,good
Good,good
挺好用的，挺好玩的，而且还可以同步。,good
"It's a great app, just the one that I've been looking for. It's a bit overwhelming at first since I'm still starting with activities i want to write about, but i got to customizing my wants after a week. I hope this app will keep on improving and then I'll subscribe in the future as a support for the developers",good
Edit: This one complaint has been fixed! Its perfect now I really love this app and I use it everyday! The new black and orange theme is really nice to look at! My only feedback is that I wish the color of the widget changed to match the chosen in-app theme because the yellow list kinda sticks out from my background. Other than that the app is perfect! Thank a lot Levor!!,good
"I have only spent a day with this app, but I know that I will spend a great deal of time with it in the future. Pros: Highly versatile and fast. This app can be designed to fit any goal and can be tuned to fit any RPG balancing you want. Nearly everything is customizable. It's also fast. From first tap of the app to checking off accomplished tasks it takes just a couple seconds. Cons: Perfecting the customization to the RPG experience you want can take a long time, but it's worth it.",good
"This app makes creating new habits more fun, by making it feel like a game.",good
"I love using this app for myself to help me prioritize/organize my time for school, homework, and playing. One thing I would love to see in here is an option where you can have multiple characters so a parent can get the app on their phone and make a character for each child so that they can keep track of what their child has done and what rewards they can have, ex: playing games, extra dessert, screen time, etc.",good
Very useful,good
"Классное приложение, не все функции доступны в бесплатной версии, но их вполне хватает. Заполнение всех заданий и их вес (опыт, монетки) очень простое и не нудное. Можно поставить себе награды за выполнение дел. Все круто.",good
"Lots of control & customization of tasks & rewards. Could benefit from some additional features, but no app has everything. Been using for 2 weeks & it's helping me accomplish important tasks I usually lack motivation to do.",good
It's great for planning out goals of any time frame whether it be short or long term. It's also extremely customizable which I adore a lot.,good
Great app. I would love to buy it for lifetime but the price is too steep for a student in india. Hopefully like Netflix and Spotify etc have done with their prices for india. You can give us some price which will be affordable in our country.,good
Fun way to manage tasks and improve yourself.,good
Such an organized convenient way to keep track of my life,good
They should change the name. Have no idea it would be awesome just from the name.,good
good. yes. me like,good
"I honestly love this app. It's a great way to keep track of everything you need to do and it's very versatile, allowing you to customize tasks in a wide variety of ways. Only thing it's missing is a version I can use on my laptop, I might have to get bluestacks running :)",good
"Great app. I wish the one time payment wasn't so absurdly expensive, but it's definitely worth using.",good
Don't import its resets evryfing to defult,good
This app has helped me keep on track and get better habits,good
"Canny, I've been jogging, cleaned the houseand took the dog for a walk. Recommended.",good
"As a lifetime gamer and task lister, this app seems bespoke to me. Thanks for making it!",good
Really motivates,good
"Hands down, one of the best apps for productivity, to do, etc.! (Or maybe the best one on the market). Thanks Taras!",good
"Hi. I love the app. There's a bug that I want to share. I created a daily task (once a day) but it doesn't go away after completing it from ""Today's"" task. What do I do? Thank you Edit: Gonna subscribe soon! Can you add sounds when consuming items, please? Thanks!",good
I have only had it for a few days and don't fully understand every feature.. but it is the only to do list app that has so far worked for me. Probably because of it being based on a reward system even if the rewards are only virtual.,good
Great app for goal setting & tracking in a gamified way.,good
I love it! Incredibly customizable. Keeps me on track to do the things I want to do!,good
"Wow, this is such an exciting way to try to organise and get motivated to do more of the things i mean to do each day and with my life..i still don't understand a lot of how to make it work but it's great fun finding out and seems to be very customisable to make it fun to build your skills and habits you want to develop in life to get to your aims.. When i get enough money i will definitely buy the app as i think the developer has made a REALLY great way totry2get my life to how i want it to be.",good
"Adorei, é perfeito.",good
"It's designed as a to-do app with game mechanics on top of it, not the other way around - the simplicity feels like any other Android app, although the interface can take 15 mins to get used to (and then some more).",good
"If life is a simulation... Then the only way to win is to take meticulous control of your life. To live it for as long as you can. Think Minecraft of the future. Life is peaceful during day, but night time eventually comes. 2020 is night time. However you can survive it. When things get peaceful again...(whenever it does) prepare further for nighttime. Figure out your stats. Figure out your level and continue to level up more efficiently every time. There's always room for improvement.",good
Very Active App,good
"When will this app be added to the Microsoft Store for PC??? Edited: I've noticed that when I perform a execution, it doesn't always leaves from the list of today's executions. Can I fix that by settings or is it a bug?",good
I think it's a pretty straightforward app. It definitely helps when you need to place certain tasks throughout your week as a reminder.,good
"Most amazing task organizer. Everything is customizable and easy to understand. Functions perfectly whether you use every detail of the app or just basic task lists. I'm Pavlov-ing myself with the task completion noise and my serotonin levels are through the roof. I've never wanted to give anyone money before but I 100% would buy every add-on, even though I don't need to, because I can do almost everything for free (HOORAY) THANK YOU SO MUCH",good
Amazing! This app has had a really large positive impact on my life (in just a few short months). Would definitely reccommend ^-^,good
It's the best task gamification app I have ever seen Even if you don't need the gamification it's still better than most other to do apps in task organization Edit : if you are capable please add the option of adding files to tasks like some other to do apps,good
Love the app but i have a question. I have a morning routine set up with subtasks. Is there a way to hide the subtasks from my daily task veiw and only have them show under the master task pulldown tab? Also i would love it if i could order my tasks customly without having to assign a time to them. This is by far the best app i have found for setting to do's for yourself. As an adult with adhd I love the fun childish functionality without it looking like a childs game on my phone.,good
"Some of it is a little unintuitive, but overall this is an awesome and free app.",good
Encourages me to complete task,good
"I love the app and it's customizablity with some notes; repeats are confusing and not easy to work about (for instance repeat times during one day versus general repeats), moving tasks to different days (calendar drag?) , can set specific times on multiple reminders, making routines, changes easy to lose when pressing back, and unable to manually order tasks by preference in list form. Adding stars for great responsiveness and care of creator =D",good
The developer is pure genius. Well execution on customizable gamification app execution. I have bought a subscription as soon as using it for 10 minutes. I would like to make a business inquiry. Is the contact information listed here updated? Do you check your e-mails often? I am looking for a firm communication channel with the developer.,good
"Started few days ago, so far it's good",good
This is a great app. I recommend a search bar though for both skills and characteristics,good
RPG bolado,good
This app is just what I needed to make progress on my goals. Contains a whole bunch of features and customisability. It is also easy to use. I only have an Issue with the Task List Widget not updating properly after completing a task.,good
I've been doing this for several days and it's been working wonders,good
"Everything is able to be modified. You can gamify whatever you want of your day a day life. It would be nice to sort tasks as you wish, just moving them in the order you want without needing to rename them or other tricks to put them in the order you like. However still being quite good for everything it offers",good
"Hi, I just started using this app a few days ago and I'm absolutely blown away. It's kept me on track for a bunch of my activities and the UI is so customisable while being clean. I have a minor suggestion about if progress bars to recurrent activities can be added? Eg. I'm reading a book and have that as a recurring task but I'd like a slide bar to be able to advance my progress daily. Subtasks don't show in the widget as well. This app is still amazing and great work on everything so far!",good
"The best app you can find of this kind. It is well built, creative and regularly updated. With this app you don't need any other planning or to-do list apps. It is completely worth buying. I gladly payed full price for this high quality app.",good
Probably the best task managing app out there.,good
"This is the best, most customizable, app around. I appreciate the dev for being on top of responding to feedback and such. The app has grown over the years, and it keeps getting better and better with quality of life changes. It's actually spoiled me from installing other similar style apps again simply because I can just make everything to my taste all in one app. It really makes keeping a schedule feel like less of a chore, and for a gamer like me, that's golden. Real life questing is fun!",good
Awesome app overall. It would be great to see some kind of progress functionality inside tasks. For example counter 0-10(or any other number you input) for push-ups / book pages / words learned etc.,good
It's not that bad.,good
"This app is brilliant! Clean, simple, and ultimately customizable. I've been wanting something like this for a while!",good
Awesome app The best i've ever used,good
"The app is great. There are so many features. Actually, you create your own game. I didn't notice any ad even with a free account. You can donate 1 dollar to support developers with cup of coffee :) Edit: Still love the app. Enjoy your coffee, Taras! ;)",good
Fun. Versatile!,good
"Such a good idea. Very generous to help us out for free. Helps me recognize my accomplishments instead of dismissing them and losing track of how much progress I'm making. Would recommend having essential daily tasks pre-scheduled so that they're easy to tick off the list but writing in unique events only AFTER they've been accomplished in order to maintain intrinsic motivation, memory, and your capacity to self-monitor. Use this to record progress, not replace internal self-determination.",good
"Only complaint is how often it asks you to rate it. Other than that, the app is even so great IMO that it's work buying the subscription. I love how customizable it is. For sure one of my top 5 favorite apps.",good
I'm having lots of fun. I feel motivated to do more in the day. So far I have had no adds and the free version has everything you could need. I just hope it will work for me long term!,good
"It's pretty cool app, very convenient to customer everything. And really immerse into the game which is your life",good
Very good app for complete tracking,good
Great App. Changing my Life,good
Really cute but I'm more into minimalist designs. It works really well tho if the interface seems like ur thing. I like that they have a reward system. I might just get it back just for that bc no other app that I've seen has that.,good
"Life is like a video game. The free version: very detailed organization with a clean look, but well worth the time it takes to figure out.",good
"Great app. I am trying to find an application like this one for a while. If you are looking for an app that will help you grow, this is the one for you. You have multiple skills to choose from. Also, you can create your own. I love that they had programming, and an Icon of Python to choose. To get the full features you need to purchase the application. However, you don't need to buy or watch annoying adds to use the application",good
Best habbit app,good
Really fun and thorough ^^,good
I need more options of anything,good
BEST TASK APP EVER!!!!,good
"Great app, let's you customize pretty much anything you want to create your own system. Only reward app I kept coming back to. Has helped me to create change in my life.",good
i need the application thanks developers :),good
"Very fun app. Lots of customization and a very polished app. Some features are blocked unless you pay(calender and some icons). They aren't needed to enjoy the app though. Can't complain, it works great reminding and motivating me to get stuff done. :)",good
Awesome,good
Exceptional.,good
This app is amazing I'm having fun just setting up that being said an optional progress bar for tasks would be really helpful,good
Excellent app.,good
Perfect!!!,good
Great app. Makes doing hard and annoying tasks more fun.,good
"I LOVE this app. I had tried Habit RPG and I liked the generalized idea behind it but wished it was more in depth & video game like, that you could not only lvl up but gain skill points, this is extremely detailed, even has characteristics you can lvl up as well as skills & allows for complete customization in everything. Being a nerd & someone who lacks discipline, I forsee this to be an extremely useful tool to help me stay on task, achieve my goals and feel like I am ACTUALLY lvling up IRL!!!",good
"It really feels like I have a tabletop character sheet for myself, and I didn't even know I wanted it until now. The skill and stat customization is incredibly deep. The reward system is great. I highly recommend the premium, if you can afford it. These devs deserve it, and the calendar is a nice bonus on top of all the aesthetic additions.",good
Beautiful and detailed app! There are two features that would make it more useful: 1) a counter to keep track of quantity (example: alcohol drinks); 2) a limit which causes a fail if you go over (example: limit 14 drinks in a week or 2 per day),good
"This is cool, I'm on my first day and just put in all my major daily goals like exercising and reading. You can customize the traits that are rewarded by each activity, as well as penalties for failure. You can even link customizable titles to your level progression (my personal goal: Archwizard of the Order of Ptolemy). Very few features are locked behind the paywall, and everything that is essential is free.",good
awesome,good
very good,good
"Excellent way to gamify your personal habits, with many levels of customization so you can set the difficulty levels of tasks as well as the level of self improvement those tasks provide.",good
It's a great app,good
Thanks for this perfect app. How I can use coins? How I can buy with coins??,good
Great idea. Managing yourself like playing game.,good
Fun way to track tasks,good
Nice app very use full,good
"Linking tasks to higher level skills & characteristics, and then seeing them increase, is perfect motivation for me.",good
Amazing.,good
It's a really great app I love most that it reminds you about your tasks since I tend to forget a lot especially feeding my pets and watering my plants it's easy and fun to use especially with the reward system I think it would be challenging if the app had personal rewards for say keeping up with your tasks for a large period of time and all but honestly I love the app it's perfect you can personalize it to whatever you want or need,good
"Just installed this yesterday. Loved it. Love the concept. Love the design. Too bad the free version can't have access to the calendar 😝 but otherwise, it's a great app. Am gonna give it a go for another few more weeks before deciding to commit to premium.",good
It really really good.,good
Seems to be useful so far.,good
"Awesome app to gamify tasks. I've been using it for 3 months and I love many things about it. I won't write them because I can only type 500 characters. BUT I wish it could include ""time tracking"", like the one from Toggl. Also I strongly wish it could have a desktop version (and IOS). Another thing would be to sincronize with a google calendar, not only the one inside the app (I also think the calendar needs accuracy). Lastly being able to interact with other users and a ranking would be great.",good
The idea is just wow. Well executed.,good
"Out of all the RPG themed productivity apps out there, this one has certainly met my needs. To whoever who comes up with the idea and design of this app, you certainly created a miracle for a guy like me! Thank you so much for creating this app, dear developers! P.S. I'll be giving this app a proper review one day, after a few weeks / months of using this! :) Till again, you've certainly created a great future for me, through this app man! 😭",good
Great work mates!,good
"Really loving this app! I've used a couple other productivity apps but this is the first one I've really stuck too. Turns out failing tasks and losing points really motivates me. Was wondering if it's possible to get bonus points for completing tasks in succession? Think it would help with habit formation. Otherwise does everything I need it to and really happy with it, great job!",good
Great productivity app to stay organized,good
I really love this app It's fantastic in many ways. I wish I could adjust the overdue settings as tasks are set as overdue too quickly for me :),good
Amazing,good
Does everything I want it to do and more!,good
Amazing app!! You can literally modify EVERYTHING into the way you prefer! It's a little complex but with only minutes you can understand it's interface and fall in love with it. I love it even more because you can go up levels and it makes really more fun doing your tasks! No ads and almost everything for free. Pretty amazing!,good
"I love this app. It has so many features and I love the creator listens to the app's reviews. That's rare, and when it happens, I have to give props to the creator. If there is a feature I would like, it's items that can change your current photo (temporarily). This app is a 10 🌟 app and I highly recommend it",good
"I've only had this app for a couple of days but it's already helped me so much! I've tried a LOT of planner-type apps but I never felt motivated to follow through with them. This app allows you to make schedules and tasks, and it has a reward system in place! I've had a hard time focusing with all this online school stuff, but my productivity has shot up due to this app :) definitely worth a try. Thank you devs!",good
Hmm... I like it,good
"It has everything you truly need with a degree of complexity, besides it's versatile. Liberty to do many things. Thanks for the app. NO ADDS. Seriously. Congrats",good
"Hello, can you please add in your godlike widget transparent theme? I really need in this 🙏",good
"I like it! I waited purposely almost 3 weeks in order to give here a true opinion. This application is amazing because it has so many possibilities, like everything is open for you, you can set anything. This is why I recommend to whom wants to use it, to take the time to understand as it works. Read the user guide included in the app so you can set the application to your exact goal. So at the beginning it may not so clear, and maybe there are more friendly use apps, but this one in adjustable",good
This is my first time with a RPG but I love this To Do List.,good
Gufy,good
This app is great. I was using different methods to change myself and they all failed but this RPG style game which I can even customize has proved to be most efficient.I would like the app developer to add some more stuff like new acheivements at different levels and getting access to more functions as we level up.😊(it will make app more interesting instead of getting more and more boring every time),good
So far loving this app,good
I enjoy this app because I am a task oriented person and I can see how much I have completed and the XP gaming quality to it makes me feel like I m reaching for a goal with immediate gratification not just doing work,good
Very easy to personalise and use 5⭐,good
Very nice,good
"Love the app, it's much fun, engaging, and helpful to stay focused on your goals and developing new habits. Much better than competing apps (Habitica comes to mind) even if they have better social integration. Of course one can always add new features and improve design elements, but if you are looking for a task manager look no further. This is the best on the market. Highly engaging and fun to interact with.",good
"As a fan of rpg's, and a slacker who needs encouragement to do things besides play video games, I have to say this is the greatest app ever. It's so much fun.",good
"I enjoy using this app, it makes habit tracking fun and entertaining..",good
This app is really great. Easy to keep track of all my many activities.,good
Best life rpg app that I could find. Support is very helpful and fast at responding. Everything other app I tried was all about them milking money. But not this one.,good
Great! It's been helping me a lot,good
Es buena para aser mis abitos y mis tareas tiene muchas occiones,good
One of the bests to-do apps.,good
Good apps,good
Fun way to celebrate your accomplishments!,good
"I love it the app, but why is so expensive?? Perhaps more cheap, help us to buy it!",good
"Life changing app. For someone who loves RPG game so much like me, making myself the avatar in real life helps much to change my own attitude to work and lifestyle. My only comment is to allow description for every hero statuses. And maybe in the future, the icon will look more appealing with colors. Also, for premium members let them be able to have several heroes at once. This will inspire people to work on different aspect of their life more closely. Thank you for makin such an amazing app.",good
"Great app. Could suggest rewards that fit the task type, offer actual customer / icon customization, and allow linkage of tasks to overarching goals that have separate rewards attached. Other than that - best app like this I can find - a lot of great features.",good
Been using the app for a couple of weeks and have lost 4lbs already. Took a bit of setting up with the tasks and rewards but it is very customisable. Gamifying my life might be just the thing I need to get into better habits and lose some weight!,good
"This is an amazing app. You're able to customize almost everything to what you want. There are some things I'd love to see added, though. Some way to have an item reward you with money would be nice, and being able to have a task directly award you with an item, too. Developer(s), if you see this you have done an amazing job, I'll be getting the in app subscription soon to support you.",good
"Great app which has everything I need! It's not very easy at first, but the result it gives is worth the effort. I like that you can see your characteristics in a diagram and how customizable everything is. Thank you!",good
Best motivational game style to do list app I've tried. Subscription cost is very reasonable and the free version is great too. Definitely recommend!,good
Amazing app!,good
"Let's me focus on working out and ect the rewards are good from me going to the scale I lost more than 50 pounds good for activities and exercise I hope you enjoy it as well because I have a reason to give it a five star rating I have set the reward to make me improve better and make it all a more of a challenge thank you creators for giving me this inspiration to do better and be more healthy I will continue using this app for the rest of my life - enjoyable of this app , mogginz",good
This app makes me so much more productive,good
Great app,good
It's a really great app. Although it would be better if you could use costom icons for tasks and rewards and it would be better if the app didn't blur low quality pictures (as I like to use pixelated pictures). I also love the fact that this app works offline. Thank you for the great work 👍,good
Estive procurando por um aplicativo como esse.,good
Very neat,good
"Overall very good. U can edit the skills and characteristics u want and edit the rewards as well. I just want to suggest: can u add a feature where we could interact with other users or create a group according to the skills and characteristics that we have. In that way, we can also get rewards for our grp and loose our stamina/ health if we wont be able to do task. These will trigger us more to participate. :) ill purchase the calendar soon if school will be back. Thanks!",good
"First of all it's an excellent app. I like the fact that it is highly customizable. However, I'd like to make a suggestion. Your app lacks the ""emotional"" aspect a bit. I suggest to add support of small custom avatar-like images to the tasks instead of monotone colored icons. This way a task will associate with something positive/inspirational. Pressing on a task could then show a larger version of the image in the task view screen. Do not understimate the power of visual associations.",good
C'est la meilleure application pour vaincre la procrastination,good
In a weird way its cool to level up doing mundane tasks.,good
great app for a to-do list with a hint of gamer mentality,good
"Very nice. Takes effort to customize, but can be a useful tool.",good
Great App! I paid for the pro version. I like the customice options to create character traits and unique skills. Pls upload a yoga and a meditation icon :),good
"Why nobody said about the app missing a FAIL TASK button?·It's been so hard and time consuming to just fail some tasks. It's the best app from this category, besides this minor flaw.",good
"I actually want to complete tasks and see how much I can level up each day! I love it! Its a game now, not a chore :D",good
Very good so far.,good
Дякую,good
"This app is so cool! It's geared towards complete configuration from the user, so give your goals the time they deserve and map it out. Once you get through learning the app, it will be an awesome tool for your future development!",good
Good,good
"Although I ended up settling on a different tracking method, this app is nice. It offers tons of customization options. (Edit): What personally ended up working for me, unexpectedly, was just a low-tech checklist, lol. Still, praises to this app's design options :)",good
I'm a gamer and dislike doing chores. This gives incentive,good
I have had zero motivation to do anything lately with the whole Cortana thing going on but this really helps me get things done,good
A frightfully creative and entertaining way getting your tasks done! 👍🏽,good
"If you see this Taras or other developers, I believe your app would benefit immensely and more people will download it if you were to implement an online feature or a way to access on any device such as a computer. If you would upload a website with this apps interface and sync to the cloud, more people would be able to access it, meaning more profit which would mean more great reviews, etc. If you were to add this feature like Habitica has, I, and more people, will likely buy the subscription.",good
Good,good
"Best gamify your todolist + productivity app, really recommend it to everyone",good
"Рекомендую.Отличное приложение, я вернулся и снова сразу подписался. Реквест:из-за большого количества опций и настроек часто тратишь много времени на заполнения всей инфы о задачах.Я бы очень хотел увидеть возможность добавления стандартных параметров для пользовательских групп задач.К примеру: у меня есть To Do лист и скажем Книги. Хотелось бы чтобы при добавлении задач на прямую в группу(+) подтягивалась иконка с цветом, длительность, повторение, и др параметры.И побольше иконок для платной",good
Ok,good
Wonderful app. Thank you developer. Please keep update.,good
"Amazing system, some what hard to balance custom goals without someone else's help. But fun and helpfully none the less .",good
"Aww man glad I found this!!! Love rpg games and this is a great incentive to get stuff done, just wish the full version wasn't almost 60 bucks or a subscription fee... Lil much for a reminder app",good
No end of task/ habit days. So useless,poor
"doesn't worth its price, there are better alternatives for cheaper prices. many crucial features are not there yet, like synchronization; and they're not developing anything anymore. btw, i also can't believe that there are still softwares that use sunday as a first day of the week. in which century you are living in guys?",poor
"If you give 10 habits creating system in free version.it will be better.but you should not give under 10 habits system in this app .lest useless app maybe.so,be careful it. and tasks priority shorting system, and priority show on task or habits screen have to add .then,it will be better app.",poor
"Worst routine app I ever seen . Literly worst and really a bad app. I set a reminder for a day to go to market but it doesnot remind me , I always check my phone when any of notification appears but I set alarm for a task it doesnot give me any notification and wasnot rings any of alarm. Please donot downloaded this it was really a worst app. If, you download it you just waist your time and data . Worst app .",poor
Its ok Missing so many features Not user friendly Realized that after got the paid version,poor
Very Worst App........😠😠😠😠,poor
"Este é um ótimo aplicativo, eu melhorei muito e mudei meus hábitos também, eu realmente gosto desse App.. Obrigado",poor
Worst app,poor
"limits habits to like 6 or whatever unless you pay, useless",poor
only 7 free habits,poor
This what is really useful to me. It is useful to manage my time it is the good app for time management I prefer download this app and and use,poor
"It's the worst app ever, doesn't give any reminder doesn't work ..... Just a waste of time!!!!! 👎👎👎👎",poor
This app is a scam it does not work at all nothing is real here from the first day I used it it refused to work at all,poor
The have a limit on how much habits you can add for free. Going to u install,poor
Bad app,poor
no notification showing,poor
Really? Dark mode behind a pay wall?,poor
"I have autism and downloaded this app to help mange my tasks and routine, but after trying to work it out for 10 to 20 minutes, I've decided it's not for me. I couldn't set a very simple habit of brushing my teeth twice a day, or a reminder to stretch twice a week on certain days of the week. Not as straight forward to use or set up as it seemed.",poor
It is a super app. I wouldn't forget my activity,poor
"Not sure why but it doesnt seem to alert you or at least does intermittently after its first alert. For example I had a habit to check a website every day at 11:00 to check for updates, it worked the first time however I get no other updates thereafter. Not much ise if theres no consistency.",poor
"It never alerts me, only gives notifications when you open the app",poor
It was confusing,poor
No reminders,poor
"If you want to use dark mode, you'll have to but ""premium"". I understand the need to make money off your app, but thats just scummy.",poor
"I got the premium version The main drawbacks of this app are: 1- I cannot customize the categories 2- If I do a task earlier, it still alarming on scheduled alarming time 3- removing done tasks is not available Just moved to the bottom",poor
Costs money to make pixels darker,poor
Terrible can't control whether things repeat it not and a study task is automatically a habit? Stupidly paid for the premium upfront. Agree with others that idk where 4.6 came from.,poor
It doesn't remind me. I even forgot I still had it on my phone.,poor
"Alarms or notifications don't work unless you open the app, then it floods all the notifications for the tasks as i open the app. Defeats the purpose of the app. Tedious round-about way to delete a Habit compared to deleting a Task. Not sure how this app got a 4.6 rating.",poor
Zero integration with any calendar so literally worthless!!,poor
"Don't receive any notifications, alarms",poor
"You have to pay for the dark mode? Really? It doesn't mattee how helpful this app could be for my life if it damages my eyes a lot more just because I can't afford to go premium and buy the amazing ""dark mode"". At least those whole 2 seconds of interacting with the app were fun.",poor
Limited Habits,poor
It's says Error when copying data when I tried to export data. Can you please mail me the solution again Please,poor
Absolutely hated it it was just weird,poor
Its not working properly,poor
Too expensive.,poor
Not advisable to anyone.,poor
"Couldn't edit any habit in this apps can't add pages, episodes, and liters bec they're not available in the edit menu.. The only way to edit a habit is to delete it.",poor
App has too many error to count.,poor
"It beautifully displays, tracks, and reports all of my important habits that I want to develop. Unfortunately, it doesn't have an option to set recurring tasks - things that I need to do regularly, but that aren't necessarily vital to my personal development. I paid for the full version, but actually stopped using it because I don't like that it won't differentiate between a habit and a recurring task. Looking for something to better suit my needs ...",poor
Dark mode in premium,poor
Can not shut off notifications. They keep turning back on.,poor
You can only add 7 habit for free version.,poor
"I like the app except I'm having trouble with my reminders. My alarms and notifications only come through when the app is in use. As soon as I exit the app, I don't get any alarms or notifications for the times I set them. Until I open the app again, then all these alarms and notifications I've missed pop up. Really quite inconvenient.",poor
"it was great for the first couple of months. later on lost track of reminders and notifications, it would notify hours later. so i had to remove the app, just confused and ruined my plans for the day ahead.",poor
"Needs tactile completion reward of some kind. Also, i don't like how a completed task stays on the list and looks almost like it hasn't been done yet.",poor
"HabitNow looks like a great app, but it doesn't have an easy backup protocol. That's a complete deal breaker.",poor
"Aaah i really like this app, but too bad i cant backup to another devices :(((( i already purchase for premiun user",poor
Update killed it a few months ago. The notes were all wrongly ordered. Pointed out the issues to the developer 1.5 months ago but no fix till date. Giving up on this app.,poor
"Seems OK. It was not made obvious that you have to pay to get unlimited habits, so was a waste of my time.",poor
Cool idea but I never got any of the notifications which is kinda the whole point,poor
"It's good but for some reason, it keeps switching around everything. And I can't seem to move them around, so I have to delete them and start again. A bit frustrating but has a great purpose.",poor
"I write only 7goals,because The program did not accept. I like this app🤔🤔",poor
"Paywall for nice features. Overpriced for what it does. $5 for dark mode, get out of here.",poor
"UI seems quite simple, not overly complex. Can only add x5x [edit - 7] habits before having to pay. Hardly enough to actually truly test drive the app before paying for premium. I struggle to see how the cost matchs what you get in return. [edit] for me the habits are far more important than tasks which I can track using native apps. I feel like to get the full experience of that app there should be no limitations for a period of time before committing to spending anything on the app.",poor
Cant see all habbits report in one screen. When by mistake you delete a habbit never can see again any where your previous data,poor
You need to pay its not really free,poor
"Not worth it. Doesn't have multiple times a day, you can't change a habit after initial setup, the interface is painful, get something better.",poor
"I'm very sorry I bought the full version so quickly. The only benefit I found so far, is the ability to add more than 7 habits. I couldn't find a report that would provide information about my success and pinpoint areas that I seem to regularly miss. I was drawn to the simple UI but will probably write this off as a waste of money and return to Daily Tasks.",poor
"Pretty solid app, does what it seems, but one problem for me is that the alarms don't go off when they're supposed to. Instead of going off at the time I set, they all go off next time I open the app. They never go off until I open the app, so they're useless.",poor
"Great idea, but does not give notifications for me, which was really the thing I was looking for....",poor
No habits library,poor
I don't get this app,poor
Now a days almost all app give you dark mode out of cost. But this app gives us as a premium feature. Can't edit the start date either. Needed to delete and start again,neutral
can't really use it without the ability to create your own categories,neutral
I wanna like it but... I need it to allow me to set my routine to repeat every day without having to rewrite my routine for every day. Or am I missing something?,neutral
"Not bad but you can't check tomorrows habit today and you can't change first day of the week, what is joke.",neutral
Sahi h,neutral
Notification and alarm will automatically turn on even if i have turned off before,neutral

"Good app but it would be great if we could add categories of our own..also some more widgets would be useful..such as one for tasks and for a single habit,etc..and it would be awesome if there was like a sharing board..to share our progress with other users if the app and compete with friends in a group and be accountable for each other..it would be reallly helpful in the habit forming process.. Love your app..Please consider these changes..",neutral
Great so far. I only wish I could set up one task for more than 1 day. It's kind of annoying when you have to do the same tasks daily to have to add them daily. If I could go into the date section and choose multiple days or months that would be amazing. Also making it so I can choose a time range would also be really helpful. Some of my tasks need to be 2 or 3 hrs long and right now I can only choose a time for a reminder. It'll help keep me more organized time wise if you added these. Thanks!,neutral
"I feel that there should be an option to keep track of a habit which we repeat multiple times in a day. Update: Thanks your quick response. I don't see a multiple repeat for the same day. If I want to track a habit 3 times a day, there is no option for that. There is an option only to repeat multiple times a week but not mutiple times a day.",neutral

Why I does not able to add task on a specifically day of every week,neutral
"I have 3 issues: 1) Habit gets ticked even if we touch it by accident. It would be better if there was option to press for some time in order to get habit ticked. 2) another feature required. If we have 10 habits to get done today, & we complete 7/10. Then it would show today's productivity as 70%. 3) there should be a feature to decrease the font size of habit. -- I would like to know if you have some product with this feature, then I am ready to purchase.

It would be 5 stars if could sinc it with other device.,neutral
Nice one but I can't amend schedule days after habit saved.,neutral
not worth it if you can't go pro,neutral
Ok so it's not bad but for me it was a little bit hard to work. But don't get me wrong there are probably loads of people that do understand it. It was just a little hard for me. :),neutral

"Please add Data synchronisation with Google Drive...So, when we change device we can get our old Data on signing in",neutral
"I like this app and I bought Premium, even it was a little expensive (5,49 Euro). What I don't like is: Habits ""with a numeric value"" don't allow ""at least 0 times a day"". If you want to do something 6 times a week, with the possibility to do it twice on one day, it will stay undone the other days (-1 *). Tasks/Habits which are marked as undone may be send to the bottom, too (-1 *). Whitout Premium you only can scedule up to 7 habits! After a removal of any named defect I will change my rating.",neutral
I like this app. It's simple and gets the job done. Only downside is you're allowed to track up to only seven habits without the premium version.,neutral
"My personal experience with the app makes me say this is deforme designed more as a task management app than a habit tracking app. The two things I want to do when building a new habit are 1) easily enter the stats for the habits I'm tracking and 2) see the timeline of the habit growth in a snapshot or as a dashboard. This app focuses on ""today's tasks"", so getting to the specific habits, entering information for another day and charting progress are too cumbersome.",neutral

"Unable to edit the day you want to do your habit unless I delete and recreate the habit, which means I would lose my past statistics",neutral
It has almost everything that I need but the thing that frustrates me the most is the calendar view. That's really the most important thing to see how many days you've tracked in a row. Switch to calendar view it looks just like a regular calendar and nothing is highlighted for anything. You have to click on each individual day to see what it looks like.,neutral
I have enough credit but I can't purchase for premium,neutral
I don't get any notification on the tasks to be done neither do alarm work and so I am get frustrated pls do help me with this apart from that it is a good habit tracking app,neutral

Unfortunately the free version does not provide enough functionality for me. I am trying to track habits but it stopped me at 7.,neutral
"This app works nice if you want to track daily or weekly tasks, but it was impossible for me to schedule tasks that should happen at a certain interval. For example, every two weeks, or every 5th of the month. There is the option to schedule a task a certain amount of times per month, but not to set specific intervals or dates for such occurrences.

"It's very useful so far, however I'm not sure if you can change your daily routine. I made one for Monday and it auto filled for every single day of the week, whereas I need them different and when I go to try and add a new task to my day that I want, it changes it for all of them. Disappointing and useless if theres no way to bypass that...might as well go back to pen and paper.",neutral

"UI needs major improvements. The only app I believe which give quantitative habits also (not just binary) like 4 pages to read. Statistics based on that can be improved but nevertheless kudos for the idea. This is only app which gives upto 7 habits in free version, so keeping it. else due to UI would have rejected long time back. Current apps in market give 3 or 5 max.",neutral
I would give 5 stars if it had the feature to rearrange the items with your specific order instead or being predetermined,neutral
"Tasks cannot be ordered by their time. A habit not done is not shown as overdue. EDIT: I checked again to use it, but 1) Recurring task cannot be created. 2) Habits are shown like scheduled tasks. It's motivating to see habit progress instead on landing screen 3) It's more useful to see progress on habit activity instead of successful day. If we set to do 2 times a day but we could do it only once, it should show progress for a 30 day goal as 1/2 (today), 1/60 (total) instead of 0/30 or 1/30.",neutral
"Decent. Simple. Just a bit too simple for me. I thought the percentages counted for task progress S though it were a whole project. Unfortunately, it seems to only relate to habits. I'd like to see subtasks and then percentage competed. At least the habit statistics are clear and aesthetically pleasing.",neutral
Its a good app but i think thers some glitch i cant have more than 6 tasks when i create one it just dosen't show.,neutral
lobe this app but the only thing that is stopping me from getting premium is that i am unable to arrange the habits in order. habits are also not arranged according to time and it makes it so hard to find them. if you do fix it i will purchase this app,neutral

"Hello, I really like your app, but I am not able to turn off notifications. Every time I turn them off, they just turn on when next entering the settings screen. Could you fix this please? I am using a Galaxy A71.",good
This app is really nice and makes me to build good habits but only thing is annoying in this app is you can't import more than 7 habits until you get premium.,good
"I'm loving how I have set it up so I record behaviour that I want to change, stop or improve. And it motivates me to see those ticks at the end of the day. Only thing is when I turn off all notifications they immediately turn themselves back on. Otherwise excellent.",good
I like it for now but even after buying the premium version there are a limited number of categories. I have 3 businesses & thus the single briefcase icon doesn't work for me. I would like to be able have a different category icon for each of my various tasks & a larger range of icon options of categories available. There isn't even an icon for pets ! That is super important !,good
Best hai ji,good
It's pretty good! User friendly app. Developer gotta work or widget improvements though. Other that than It gets the job done.,good
Very nice app! How likely is is that you will implement achievements e.g. for streaks?,good
Nice app,good
"I like the simplicity of this app, very easy to use casually. I especially like it doesn't require an online account like all the other data vacuums. I would like to see cloud storage integration, Dropbox, Drive, etc. Another thing that i would love which I hope others would agree is having a defer action on tasks/habits to defer the item to next day. I can edit the task and set the date as next day,but it would be a nice feature. Would pay extra on top of premium for these. Good work 👍",good
"Does what it's supposed to, one time charge for premium (which is still pretty basic...) I wish there was a was to make the list view more compact, visually hard to scan over the list. Also a custom order option would be great.",good
Good App! ❗BUT❗ Need more features for premium users 4 sure.,good
Very helpfull i use it often to track my studies and to make sure i take out and put in my retainer. When i start getting a paycheck i plan on buying the full version.,good
"Very nice app but I have a question regarding the premium version. I have bought the premium version of this application so my question is that, if I buy a new phone can I still use the premium version of this app on the new phone? Or do I have to buy it again on my new phone? Kind regards",good
Those having trouble after closing app n not geting reminders and alarms the ans is go to ur mob settings and add Habit now app to wont's sleep,good
"Its an amazing app. Can recurring habits have something like ""every 2nd monday of the month""? Also, how can I finish a habit 2x in the same day?",good
Its very helpful,good
"It's pretty good but for me it's missing one feature. Most of my habits are to be done a certain number of times per week so it would be great to have a week view where you can see the ticks and crosses for each habit so far that week, for all habits at the same time (I know you can see them one at a time by clicking ""last 7 days"" but clicking on this for one habit closes this view for another). Then you can get a good overview of how much you have left to do that week.",good
Wow bt one thing make me pain . That is money,good
It's awesome,good
"esta buena, pero agregaría notificaciones forzadas que te obliguen a responder, y una opción para universitarios y armar un calendario solo con materias",good

Thank you,good
Nice app,good
Nice,good
Love to use,good
"Beautifully designed. Lacks the option to make tasks recurring, which would be very helpful.",good
Absolutely amazing to be able to track both daily habits as well as tasks in the same app. Only thing that would make this the best choice for this purpose is to have a web application to at least be able to add new habits or tasks and mark them as completed. Was previously using todoist for this purpose and just switched to HabitNow ❣️ Some other useful features: - Add a length to a task or habit - Be able to set a time so that tasks and daily habits can be sorted by time of day,good
Just using the free version. Has been a major help as a tool along with a habit building book I'm reading. I like!,good
Easy to use,good
Ufff me ayuda demasiado xq soy de las personas q se olvidan las cosas y esta app es la unica q encontre q tenia alarma,good
"Good app! I just wish their was a way to add a morning routine with subtasks or sub habits. Also I wish you could order your habits/tasks however you want, drag and drop style.",good
"I got this app to setup a schedule to work from home, and it's been good for that. I just set up a bunch of habits at the right time each day. The widget has been handy too to keep my schedule on my home screen. The app could do to look a bit more modern. But all of my reminders come exactly 3 minutes late? Every notification for a habit comes exactly 3 minutes late (i.e. reminder set to 2:00PM, notification arrives at 2:03PM, etc.). Developers?",good
Its good i wish i had different lists and could personalize the sound my alarms made each tine they went off,good
"Good application! One of the best habit tracker applications available on play store. Should have more features.. like authentication by fingerprint scanner, cloud storage, easily accessible sticky notes daily. The Notes option in daily habit calendar can be improved, perhaps adding a separate tab to view daily added notes would be a great idea ! I would have definitely bought premium, if it had cloud auto storage, better functionality for keeping Notes and fingerprint authentication.",good
Dashboard/ charts better be inclusive all habits. Not just per one habit. Also download to excel would be nice,good
"Helpful, but needs a way to quickly customize the order of the goals. Currently the choices are alphabetical, by priority, etc, but I would prefer a click and drag option to have them show up in the widget in the specific other I would like. I had to go into each goal and add a specific time to each one too get them in the order I want, even though I don't want to do them at a specific time.",good
"Amazing app.. landed to this one after trying a few available.. looking to buy it with advanced features.. but one important suggestion the daily status graph, it should include no. of tasks planned and how many are completed.. as well, along with habits addressed... I will surely update it with additional star as it gets supported..",good
Does exactly what it says. Would be 5 stars if the Categories could be customised.,good
Wish I could add more habits,good
"Useful and very nice apps, I bought premium, 5 stars when can backup with gdrive😁",good
"Really a fabulous app. I have tried several of the habit tracking apps. This is by far one of my favourite as it combines daily habit tasks with some ad hoc tasks for day to day life. Only one feature I miss in this app is the ability to select the snooze time. Ex. Whether I want to snooze for 1 hour or 1 day etc. Atleast some standard options. Currently it gives only 1 option. Apart from that, it's the best app",good
Straight forward. I like the widgets on this and makes it easy to check in on what you need to do for the day. The scheduling is also very helpful because you can have tasks that are intermittent or habits that are intermittent on a regular schedule. It's also nice to be able to have a goal as a number or just a yes or no did you do it or not. And the statistics are nice because you can look back and see how consistent you've been with something and that will remind you to buckle down.,good
"Hi, I would've given this app 5/5 if I hadn't already spent so much time exploring it. It's so cumbersome as it is to check what I have scheduled for a day in the future. I have to enter the calendar and click on the date on a ""month-view- interface. Please make it more intuitive, let me swipe in a direction to navigate to the past/future. Let me also edit tasks/habits from a day in the future.",good
I wish this app allowed me to adjust what habit I want in any order I want. It lets me organize my abc order or time but not the way I need it. Also wish the conpleted habit or task would disaapear after I complete each day. It either stays where it is or goes to bottom. Other than these I like it.,good
Great app with an ugly widget. If the widget was cleaner I'd give 5 stars.,good
"Almost Perfect, an option to export Archived Habits (preferably to excel) would be Great..",good
Not bad if you want to install,good
Love this,good
Decent app with good features allowing for good habbit tracking but I am unable to reschedule dates on the habits. I have to delete the habit then remake it with the revised dates which is a big hassle,good
"Very good. Simple and easy to use. I would like to see more statistics, because for now I can only see the statistics for only one habit at a time, but not a overall statistics.",good
Easy to use and the alarm works great,good
Addition of day counter for negative habits will be great. Also any option for writing notes for failures in habits will be useful. And widget isn't working.,good
"What if one wants to add a habit wherein one wants to do that thing 4 times in a week and not on 4 specific days of the week. I guess while adding a habit, this app requires one to select 4 specific days. Just a suggestion. It would be really great if this flexibility can be allowed.",good
I love it! Only problem I found is that you can't edit the start date once the habit is created which is a nuisance.,good
"Have only used the app a little while, not to bad for basic tasks. To bad you can't do lots of tasks unless you buy the premium version. It's an easy app to use",good
Good,good
"Everything is good, I bought the premium after 5 minutes used! But one question, why we can't create a task with a date which is the day before??? (eg; Today is 11 May. I can't create a task on date 10 May. Sometimes we might be overlooked or too busy to add task, but we need to have a record of what we had done on the day, it can make us feel so ""completed"")",good
"I like this app as it is a simple way of tracking your habits. However, there are a couple of things I wish were improved. 1. If I have updated all of my habits for the day, the app should know that and stop the daily reminder to complete them. 2. I wish the analysis was a little better. Have some graphs visually showing progress. Also, how about showing how I am doing on my habits as a whole, not just the individuals? For example, if I have a day where I don't do any of my habits. Thx",good
"Have been using it for a week only and will most likely go premium! I love it. But a few needed suggestions. An option to make a task recurring. And also maybe on one same habit, have different times per day: weekday /weekend. And I can't seem to edit which days for habits after the initial setup. I also would like the completed button to be a little bit harder do. Maybe a swipe would be nicer.",good
Please create desktop app,good
Good,good
I really love the setup of this app. I wish it had the ability to see weekly progress in a bullet journal style. That would make it perfect for me.,good
Easy and practical !,good
"Nice App Very Good ic k Zariye se Hm apna Roz mara ka Kam time pe Kr skty hein, apni adaat pr qabu pa skty hain or Kam ko Yad se kr skty hain kisi ka Shikwa gilla b nai rehta... Bohat smjhdari se banaya gaya hai ye App Nice Application...",good
"The app is pretty good and I love the reminders. However, it's kinda difficult to edit already made habits, especially the number goals.",good
Easy to use. Great for creating new routines and habits,good
Like the app. Either I haven't found it or they don't have it in the free app but I would like to see a calendar with all the habits listed each day. Would be fun to see at the end of the month all that I did on one calendar.,good
"Pretty good app, matches description.",good
Nice app. Quick question can I add new categories when adding my habits? I'm not see an option. Only the options that came with the app is available. Is it that everything else must go under other? Please advise,good
The app is perfect for people trying to get more organized it's easy to use and I use it all the time for homework or workouts the only tiny problem is that it has some locked features that u have to pay for,good
This is a very good app... just if the shopping list could be shared in watsapp would be very nice.,good
Why there's no option to change schedule?,good
"It's good, but calendar view just don't make sense with the obligation to select a day to see it's schedule (which is not what I'd be looking for when in calendar view, preferring much more to see in one look any day I haven't done something, or something like rate of habits successfully done)",good
Preaty nice but they could improuve the UI it took me some time to figure it out. And I know that to use the widgets on the home screen you need to pay for premium but it would be an improvement if it would instead take you to the app,good
Hesitant to buy premium. I feel like currently the only reason to buy premium is to have more than 7 habits and to make it look pretty. I'm on a budget and if I'm spending $5 I certainly want more bang for my buck. I wish the developers offered more in premium to make it worth the price.,good
Works Great,good
"I find the app amazing. It is one of the best habit apps that I've used. The only thing I don't like is that I've bought the premium but I don't feel like it was worth it. The only thing that I really needed was to have more than 7 habits but, the rest is just decoration. It would be really nice, if there is an overall progress page to check how am I doing in every Habit, instead of going through every single one of them. Another thing that would do this app just perfect, would be the possibility of having a desktop app for the computer. Other than that, I recommend to download it. Keep doing it so!",good
"Great app, very usable and straightforward, but I wish the calendar view showed the days you had completed all of your goals for that day. Seeing your progress streak would be very encouraging!",good
"Wish you could set tasks to recur at regular times, but it's a good app overall",good
"It is a great app. But still there is space for some improvement. The calendar for example: you have one to add more tasks, other to see each specific task and the days that you did the job, but note one to see the sum of all tasks. You should create a resume calendar, where I can see the percentage of jobs that I accomplished in each day.",good
"Easy, simple, cheerful, effective",good
"Funciona bien, pero si le hacen falta cosas, tengo la versión premium, resulta que debería existir la opción de crear categorías (donde uno pueda seleccionar el ícono que más le convenga de la lista que ustedes dejen y poder asignarle el nombre de la categoría) por ejemplo: como sabemos, existe categoría denominada ""study"" pero no se puede configurar mas de ahí. Sería bueno poder crear categorías con el nombre de cada materia para tener un mejor control de lo que se HACE.",good
I like using the app and my weekly progress. I would like to see a total of how many things I did each day and maybe a graph? I like positive reinforcement.,good
Would be great to customize the alarm. I want to test pavlov effect with supplements.,good
"Habitnow is the first todo list with a key feature I've been looking for: to-do items that are automatically created at certain times. As such it is the best such app I've ever used. The only problem is that the author made no provision for hiding completed items. They just hang around cluttering the list--the best it does is move them to the bottom. I find it very odd that anyone would want to stare at completed to-do items. Certainly that shouldn't be the default, but there it is.",good
Great at 1st,good
Alarm not working at all. I have checked all settings in my phone they all are on. Could you please assist me on same.,good
"Love the app. Best of it's kind IMO. Not perfect but so close! This app has the potential to be used for so much more than just habits and tasks! If I may suggest: - having the "".00"" digits be optional and not by default when setting/entering goals. - having multiple reminder/notification throughout the day on one habit to enter data multiple times a day (ex: 200 push ups a day, with 4 reminders so I can do 4x50 or something instead of having 4 habits) or the ability to group habits.",good
Great however marking down one star as can't find a way to edit frequency of habit once you've saved it. Have to delete and recreate habit with new frequency.,good
não tem a opçāo de sub tarefa,good
"I have been using this premium version of app from past 6 months and its really great, but i still believe there are few feature still missing in it to make things easy. Like there should be dashboard which gives details of all habbits progress in bar percentage marked successful. Currently you have to go to each habbit and check the status. So a centralized section giving more details on the progress would be helpful like it is in Habbit tracker app. Also a dynamic habbit counter could be added",good
"Nice but please give option to add different time intervals for habits. For example I want to develop habit of drinking water and want the reminder to come at multiple particular times a day. The app allows only one specific time for the reminder, so please add the mentioned feature.",good
I haven't started using it officially but I'm giving a 4 star because the User Interface is on point... I'm starting my habits on monday... Hopefully the functionality part will be as user friendly as the UI. Thank you,good
"I looked at a lot of habit tracking apps and this one was the closest I've found to what I was looking for. Unless I missed how/where to do them, there are three things I wish I could do in the app. First, create custom categories/subcategories, especially under health. Second, edit start dates without having to delete and retype to correct. Three, have the ability to add notes.",good
"So far I like the app. Question - I see a spot where it says, notes for the month, but how do I input notes? I don't see the option to enter notes.",good
"Hey, awesome app. It wasn't long until I purchased the unlocked version. However, some things could be improved. For example, you can't change units after the habit is created. And it would be nice to hide the "".0"" part after digits, since mostly it refers to ""minutes"" or ""iterations"" or ""cups"" and it looks kinda sloppy to see your goal described as ""Learn at least 30.0 minutes"" or ""Drink at least 2.0 cups"". If the number is whole, why not just hide that point zero - it'll look neater, I think.",good
Great app! How can I change the alarm sound,good
awesome app .. i like the daily work and habit tracking .. thanks guys,good
Helped me a lot,good
"Make sure your phone settings are allowing the app to make notifications.The app works great, and is super helpful. The only thing I would recommend is to be able to make custom categories. Right now you can do other, but can't specify. Would definitely recommend app. Update 2- I can't seem to find the setting that lets me see the notifications. I can get it to work but only once then it stops. Would you be able to help me out? After my first review you said you'd be able to if I needed it.",good
I liked it I just have to many things I want to put in it and I can't afford to pay for premium.,good
I like it. It's quite easy to use. Would it be possible to sync data between devices? That would be a lovely plus!,good
"Best productivity app I've found, goal progress tracking, hierarchical task management and progress reports would make it even better",good
"Just installed and trying out (I'll update along with my experiences). UI/UX is pleasant and clear. Looks promising. Love the Free full-featured & Premium accessory-features philosophy; I'll pay later on to support development. ISSUES: 1) can't change start-date & repetition of a habit; if it'll break history data, at least allow duplication 2) would expect SCHEDULED days to be colored/marked in the single habit calendar, as future overview; not just as achievement overview. ## So far, good job!",good
I liked it but once I got it I saw a had no need for it and I felt like I don't need it as much as others.,good
Simple and practical,good
"This is a great app! The ability to track my habits and edit them as needed is really awesome. There are just 2 things I'd really like to see that would make this a 5-star review for me: 1) Full editing options (currently can't edit the frequency for my times per period items), and 2) A help/glossary feature. I'm not sure exactly what the link icon means, as it is 0 on items I've not done or done once, but 1 on items that I've done twice or three times.",good
Easy to add habits and tasks; you see everything for that dat,good
it s great,good
"I like this app but I dont understand why I cant set up tasks that repeat unless they're habits. Or edit the categories. A habit is something you want to always do, I want to plan reoccurring tasks that are temporary.",good
"Would have been a five star had something as simple as a color theme change not came with a price. Seriously?! I have to pay premium prices just to go into dark mode. If I was going to pay, I'm most certainly not paying now. That's just too petty a thing. However, great concept guys.",good
"Great, simple app. Notifications can be better; they pop out irrespective of whether goal was achieved and thus are useless.",good
"Great app, keeps me on track and efficient. Helps me stick to my New Year's goals. Just wish we could add more habits.",good
"All to do lists should embrace habit monitoring. Also, I like it when a pending task persists on the list until it's done or removed.",good
Set a color which depends on percentage for goals.,good
"Very nice looking app for tracking habits and tasks. Have already replaced my old task app for HabitNow. Glad you can purchase the premium version and not have to buy a subscription like many other apps are now doing. I've been unable to figure out how to make tasks repeat and modify the schedule of existing habits. If these capabilities don't exist, would love to see these as improvements.",good
good enough👍👍👍,good
"Love it, bought premium. BUT needs an option to schedule reoccurring tasks like ""take mom shopping first Sunday of every month at 11am.""",good
Good app with notifications for reminding you and helping you track your progress,good
"Your app is awesome, please add sticky notification",good
Good,good
"I love this app, it's the only one I've found which combines tasks and habits in a simple way. However, I do get frustrated that I can't seem to change the scheduling of a habit after I've set it up. E.g. If it's set for once a week and I want to make it twice I have to delete it and create a new one. Can you please fix this",good
Its a good app! I honestly dont mind that you need to have premium to get the themes. As long as there are no ads im fine! I just wish you could create a widget that you can see on your home screen. That would be so convenient!,good
Please add an option to update habit/task status from the notification bar when I receive notification on the set time. Overall good app.,good
"It's relatively helpful especially when checking habit progress. However, some notifications do not come on time but nevertheless, i recommend it.",good
"Great updates! Nice color, nice experience, pro version is better, wished more was free. Need quick add tasks (see Tick Tick), needs folders, and a pomo timer would be awesome.Thanks for adding sort and categories!",good
It is a good for organising daily task n making habit,good
"I like this app alot. It lets me track my habits and goals in an intuitive way. Only would ask a few minor things, like a line on the bar chart that shows the limit/goal & task alarms even when app not active.",good
"Very nice, but would you consider letting people create custom categories, and setting intervals such as ""every 2 days"" instead of number of times a week? With that, this app would be perfect.",good
Another important feature missing is the ability to tell if I have future tasks scheduled when looking at the calendar. Currently the calander view shows days in a circle. Please colorize the background of that circle if there are tasks scheduled on that day. This is essential in order to know what days i have future tasks scheduled on. On top of the calendar it says to pick a day to see if i have a scheduled task. That is not efficient as i would need to go click each day one by one.,good
Handy habit helper,good
"Just installed this app, it is easy to use and is quite beautiful. I would love to have a vision board feature page that I can put pics and maybe a daily quote feature (spiritual?) before jumping to Premium, please.",good
Good app. Wish there were more customization,good
"Very nice UI, but need some work. 1) First week day (Monday/Sunday) option in Calendar; 2) Calendar should show tasks/habits below Calendar instead of when touching the selected day only (this makes you feel you have nothing the whole day/mont)... Add this and app will be more solid... And I may jump into Premium! Keep it up!",good
I subscribed for premium because I feel it's nice. Could you tell me where to check the status report? And how to re-organize the habits freely without any sorting order? Thanks Edit: Please add option for statistics tab separately and need to work on showing them correctly on average.,good
"Only used for a day but it's the best app I've found for daily tasks / to do lists. Would love to see the following: 1. Completed tasks move to the bottom 2. Tasks be linked to a numerical value. 3. The ability to order each item manually, daily.",good
"Love it, it works! I would like to have had it transfer my habits to the new phone but the backup folder didn't work. So I had to do them all over again. overall love it though.",good
"Thank you for responding and I'm looking forward to that update (customized categories). Another improvement I'd love to see are more options for a goal besides a daily one, such as save $100 per week, etc. I got the Premium and love the dark theme, this app is the best I've found for my needs. Thank you!",good
great app. could be better if I could have the same habit with multiple notification times so i can do it several times a day without having to recreate the habit several times. thanks,good
Very useful! Reminders at specific times which stay on the screen really help me get stuff done. Would like to be able to create own catagories and choose colours and icons for these in the premium version Thank you!,good
This app is really functional and helpful. The widget is great. Caveat: you can only track seven habits without paying. It's one time five bucks and worth it though. Suggestion to the developer: make checked off habits go to the bottom of the list so we can see what we haven't done yet more easily.,good
this is actually a really good app. I just have a couple of suggestions that make things a little more helpful 1. to be able to rearrange the habits or tasks by the time we have it set so it will look like more of a daily schedule instead of just a list 2. a button that goes with when you want to do your habit or task have it be more specific just in case we want to break our task or habit up and do half earlier in the day and the other half like drinking water or studying.,good
So close to being the perfect app. 2 things needed before I switch to using it. #1. Add ability to edit and change habit status for previous days. sometimes i don't have time or forget to update my habits on the day of. #2. Ability to set first day of week for calendar (i prefer Monday),good
quite a good app for me,good
I really like this app so far. Its flexible ans very customizable. The only thing I would add is either more categories/the ability to add my own. Health and Home are very broad categories. So being able to have sub categories would be nice,good
this helped to fix my life,good
It's good.when I install it.I have many plans every day. Thanks for your program.🌹🌹🌹,good
A really nice and amazing app. Lots of flexibility even in the free version. Love it so far.,good
Very nice app I downloaded many app but it is the best app I love this app thanks for this app 👍😄👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 I love this app,good
"Almost perfect. There's only one feature I'd like it to have that it doesn't: modify start of the week. To Europeans it makes absolutely no sense to start the week on a Sunday, which throws off my quantifications. I bought premium, but will update my review if this is added. Edit : it worked, thanks!",good
Actually we need two type of tools one for long term growth 'Good Habits' and short term ' to do list' this aap fullfil both the purpose,good
Nice app. I Love it,good
I love this app so much. 5 starts definitely. I just got the app and I love it. But there is only one thing I really want a different background on the app. But for that I need premium I don't think that's fare. But 5 stars love it!,good
I love this App. This app is just right for me.,good
Perfect for my needs of tracking goals,good
Absolutely love this app it is so simple to use and it will remind you of everything ! I would recommend this app to anyone,good
great app,good
Helps to create new habit love it,good
"Good app, this guys are cool",good
Litt it helps a lot,good
Easy to use and organize yourself. I love the habit feature to help you train yourself into healthy habits.,good
Best app keep it up 👍👍,good
"One of my biggest problem I was not so persistent and regular. Also I always tend to forget task. Habit tracking, task tracking and reminder helped me. It's like, a part of myself changed that day when I decided to install it. It's worth purchasing premium version. I really love the widget on my Home screen. Winners' secret of success is always hidden in their daily routine, so this app is highly recommend from my side. A REQUEST TO DEVELOPER TEAM, PLEASE DON'T STOP OR TURN DOWN THIS APP, EVER.",good
"This is the app that i kept from numerous time management apps. All are full of features but not practical. This app serves me clear cut. Habit & Task, simple and most practical 😍 But I can't set the ""ending"" reminder alarms for a habit, i can only start but we need a alarm that tell us to stop 😒",good
"Fantastic! This app is visually appealing, easy to use, and is exceptionally customizable with notifications and reminders. I love the ability to categorize desired habits and set their importance. The only limiting factor is that it seems to be a little more designed for people with a standard work schedule. I've suggested adding a feature that would help for those with a changing work schedule.",good
Super useful and easy to sort out.,good
An awesome app! I strongly recommend you to install it and use! It has banch of advantages including pin!,good
Terrific for reminders and tracking. Enjoying this app.,good
"Easy to use, works great..i downloaded it yesterday , pretty much what I was looking for..which was more a keep my schedule, track my schedule..remind me to drink water, you can add to do things..but i do have a separate app for daily, weekly, months GOALS..but on this app I remind myself to look at it lol.",good
Best app,good
This app really helped me organize my life!,good
life changing app,good
"I rarely pay for anything on mobile because I don't trust most of them to be consistantly good but this one is different, after starting with the trial I found it was good enough to be worth the risk and I have not been dissapointed, it is a very useful and easy to use app and the devs are really responsive and on top of things as well.",good
Excellent interface. Easy to use.,good
"The best App for building habits anyone can have for free is this, loved your efforts to think what is needed to the customers, highly recommend this to anyone who wanna stay motivated.",good
Best,good
This is the best app I am being used I will never change it I started to use 1 year ago and I did not complain of anything,good
Great app for making new Habits,good
I did not get any app like this 😃,good
I was not able to change the am and pm settings. It is really helpful app try it.. thank you very much,good
So good app,good
Great app! Instantly bought premium! Would it be possible to scale the widget (or make a new one) that's fits a small 1x1 size? I replaced my previous habit tracker with this app and I really miss that feature! I'm sure it will help others too! Keep up the good work!,good
I struggle with starting any new habits. This was instrumental in even beginning a new habit. Super easy to set up. I get reminders. There's nightly accountability to check off the daily habits. I purchased the premium as I decided I wanted more than 7 new habits!,good
Excellent... Lovely and really helpfull! Thanks!,good
It is an amazing app and very easy to use it sends me notifications so I can keep my progress every single time I look at the app it motivates me to complete all tasks and habits Trust me you will love ticking those boxes after a task is done amazing satisfaction definitely would recommend,good
Love it. Customizable so you can track progress or just be reminded to do something.,good
"Exactly what I was looking for. An app that I can quickly open, hit the + button and jot down a task that's on my mind. And can add a reminder for that bill that's due next week. I tried Evernote and it's was too complicated. This is exactly what I need. Thank you.",good
Good,good
Perfect for establishing a daily routine!,good
I adore this app,good
Pleaseee add more categories like hobbies and self development,good
My favorite part: I can leave memos for any day on any habit. Incredibly useful addition!,good
This amazing app has really helped me get myself onto the right path. Thank you to the entire team.,good
It is an incredible app 🐱,good
"Very nice, easy to use",good
I wish I found this app sooner ... I am in love with it . It very practical and it user friendly thank you !!,good
Great app for accountability and enforcing habits,good
very nice app for habit reminder u,good
Simple and easy to use!,good
Easy to use and a nice clean interface. I like the notification options and the data reports that you can see I'd give it 6 stars if I could,good
Luis《《《《☆☆☆,good
Giving 5 star becoz its ad free,good
"Very easy app to use. I also use a hardcopy calendar. This app saves me from having to transfer tasks to next day automatically until completed. I would love to view just the tasks or just the habits in addition to current view. I just got this app & liked it so much that I bought it. It helps me ""chunk down"" my tasks so they don't overwhelm me. Also loves that it includes habits. A nice combo. I love the way it looks. Great job!",good
Everybody need this app,good
Love it... It is so helpful... Everything I thought it would be and more 😃,good
this is a good app for me i love thousandage this app help all day energic,good
Increíble app!!,good
"I really like this app, the layout, and ease of use. It's the only habit tracker I find myself using and looking forward to utilizing. Great features and interface. It has everything I expect from an app of its kind to help keep me accountable. Also, the app is well maintained with timely updates and improvements. SideNote: The Developer made good on adding that frequencies change feature. Thanks Developers. .👍🏼",good
It's good apps. You can manage yourself,good
It will better to give 10 stars amazing app . Thank tou habit now,good
"Love this app I use it to list my house chores, medication schedule, study chapters, and endless other habits and tasks!",good
pretty good,good
Great tool! Easy to setup,good
"Simple to set up, looks good, works well",good
It is the best app guys don't think just go for it....😘,good
it is wonderful apps amazing!,good
This is the best habit app I have used so far and I've tried out several!,good
This app is the best app I ever seen. Super. I appreciate whoever created this app,good
Keeps me on track,good
Great app,good
Wonderful App to monitor daily routine for improvement (forced as well as manual) Request to author 1. Please add option to add reminder on specific date of every month ( monthly repeating task on specific date) 2. Biometric login 3. UI could be more better 4 add tab for notes keeping (no reminder) 5 add tab for list (no reminder) 6 option to sync Google Calendar,good
"The best app to start a new habit or quit a bad one, it includes statistics on how you really performing, which is great. You can also put password for your privacy. In addition to that you can also add tasks your goal date, reminders,.... If you have not yet downloaded it I don't know what you are waiting for😄",good
Works great for my routines,good
Wonderful app to generate good habits and complete the task.,good
Best habit app,good
Awesome,good
Its super helpful.,good
I am very much satisfied with this app. Well structured. Will like to use this app life long. Option for recurring task (unfinished task) seems awesome,good
"This app exactly suits my needs. I searched an app that allows me to record unsuccessful attempts rather than just successful ones. This app can also set Alarms as a reminder that have helped me actually do the task which otherwise wouldn't be completed. The analysis of habits suits my needs. Highly recommended. Ultimately, building habits is just finding an app that suits your needs & getting started. Happy that I found one for myself.",good
that's what I was looking for 🥰,good
Enjoy the app!,good
"So far, this is working well.",good
Best app,good
"(Premium user) Easy to use. Very useful. Thank you HabitNow ! Few suggestions cum requests : A) Please make this app eligible for Google Family library for premium users. B) Show percentage in Charts. C) Charts can be improved, graphs can be added. D) Many features, but still few more can be added. E) Reply to mails earliar.",good
"Great, no ads, funtional app",good
I like using the app. But I'm not able to see previous month bar graphs. Is it happening only for me?,good
Nice p,good
"I had this on my old phone before it broke and I tried at least 10 other apps similar to this and they never measured up. I would absolutely recommend to anyone who needs to organize theiar thoughts. It's visually good, easy to use and super helpful",good
"I really like this app, I purchsed it forever. ❤❤🙏🙏",good
Well organised and... 💾😊and loving it....,good
"Amazing app! If you have a habit you need to seriously quit (or start), it will send you reminders on a time you like, multiple times a day! Great app!",good
I love it! Palling of going pro!,good
"Great app. 5 stars for sure. What would make it even better from my POV: /- An option to set recurring tasks. e.g I want to pay my bills every month on the 1st, and I want to add a single recurring task. New Habit has the option ""How often do you want to do it"", but New Task does not. /- An ""are you sure"" question before deleting or undo option after. /- The option to filter the list of tasks by category. Especially if you also use it for work tasks, like I do",good
Does exactly what it should do. Gives you zero BS. Helped me create purpose and structure during quarantine so that I don't go crazy.,good
"Really great app, tried a few and this is certainly the best one I've used.",good
"I'm really enjoying this app, but I wish it had the following: more view, color, and size options, analytics on all habits done in the course of a week or month, and better widgets. The text is so small in the widget and the texts for the habits in the app doesn't stand out. Oh and setting rewards for completing habits would be really cool. A ""Rewards Earned"" section that you check off once you use the reward (like buy yourself an ice cream).",good
"This app is great for creating new habits. By time of day, day of week, location, etc. Run 3x per week, Take Blood pressure daily when at home, etc. Works as a task list, but is better as a habit creator.",good
"Perfect app, Highly recommend to stay organized 💫",good
I REGULARLY USED THIS APP N IT HELP ME TO TRACK MY HABBIT N ENCOURAGE ME TO BE BETTER N BETTER TASK IS ALWAYS CHALLANGE FOR ME N WITH THE HELP OF THIS APP I COMPLETE MY TASK WITHOUT FORGOTTEN OR TAKE IT SERIOUSLY SO IT CHANGE MY LIFE N SOMEWHAT MY LIFE IS REGULAR WITH THIS APP. THANKS HABITNOW,good
Do we have this app for ios ?,good
Great app helped me with my routine and reminders. Thank you,good
Really useful app..,good
Very Nice Interface. We can track our to dos for the day and Habits that we want to develop. Fair pricing. Less in size so even simple phones can have.,good
"Nice but it's really irritating that you can't edit frequency! Or a start date but I could live with that. Unfortunately, when your schedule / circumstances change, you have to create a new habit because you can't change days and frequency! EDIT: Issue fixed, thanks guys!",good
Best way to organize habits .suggest you to download the app!!!😘,good
"Best, most versatile free version habit tracker I've tried. I love the whole thing.",good
It's ambitious,good
"Its a wonderfull app, helps in keeping a track of your habits and how consistent you are with it. Also you can check your streak of following certain habit, so eventually it strengthens your will power to continue with your habit. Very simple to use. I love this app!",good
Already loved the app.. today i installed and fall in love with it,good
I love this app this is used to track our good and bad habits also we can check our track record for previous month or week.,good
Easy and good to use Very helpful to analyse the habit in detail with statistics which has made this app so useful to everyone,good
"Simple, effective and efficient!",good
Very useful app ever i have seen,good
nice,good
This is a great partner for daily activities....,good
"Muy excelente Aplicación, enamorado. Sólo le falta que permita hacer backups directamente en Google Drive.",good
Love it. Easy to use. Can customize to whatever you want and set the reminder according to when you want it.,good
The best. I paid for the premium too,good
I have enjoyed this app so much. I need to add more habits to it because it really works!,good
Amazing app Helps you design your life and your day to day activities Do check it out.!,good
"Simple,not complicated I love it",good
Best app,good
Verry helpfull😍😍,good
Buy it,good
Awesome app for habit and task tracking. It also has a fair pricing.,good
"Exactly what I was looking for, and love how user friendly it is!",good
"Great app and purchased premium, but I'm a night owl so can I go back to yesterday and mark something as complete?",good
شكرا جزيلا لكم,good
This app is very useful for students so try it....,good
I love the flexibility and customization of this app. It is also very reliable!,good
"The ability to put the widget on your home screen is a game changer. Before, I couldn't hold my streaks past a couple of weeks. I'm now at 2 months with a 90% success rate. Crazy what a constant reminder can do for you.",good
The app is super legit ;) Please make possible to decide the order in which the comments appear under the calendar in the habits section. I have a comment of 8/4/20 followed by a comment of 7/5/20 followed by 8/5/20. Is impossible to have comments organized chronologically. Thanks for the amazing app :D,good
It is so good app I like it so much,good
Seems pretty good so far.,good
A very good app ... It helps me to manage my online classes and daily routine together... 😄😄😄😄,good
"Tried many habit tracking apps, this one keeps it simple while maintaining primary functionalities that is expected from a habit tracker. No need for other day planner apps.",good
Really cool app.,good
"Super clean, customizable, easy to use scheduling app. You can make it super simple or go in depth with pie charts and bar graphs. I love it, and its helping me start new habits. I love recording things but always give up because it takes too much effort long term. But the scheduled notifications remind me to log daily before I forget! No complaints from me, I highly recommend giving it a try.",good
Amazing app....it's very helpful for me,good
It is great....,good
This is wonderful and it's only $5 (one time) to get the premium version.,good
I love having a fully customizable checklist widget.,good
A very productive app. The only bad thing was that the dark theme was not available for free. Rest everything was fine.,good
I love it for this aap,good
It is easy to follow and I love the reminders! It is super helpful for me!,good
"Best habit tracking apps. Clean, easy to use, options of goal tracking besides yes/no, and the ability to make notes. Wish that notes could be toggled by historicity. Can that be done please?",good
Chill and easy. Good for keeping track of my habits,good
This app is very simple and easy 👍. My favorite quality that the app is offering it's users is the one time buy premium that's only 5 bucks!(finally not a monthly one so I can actually buy it) anyway love the app and I like my high importance tasks that I have to finish today... The importance level... Anyway see ya 🙃,good
extremely helpful and easy to use,good
I'm so happy with this app,good
It worked perfectly for me and benefits me with fantastic pleasures!!,good
I've never rated something on Google Play so for this app to get me to give an amazing rating is saying something. This is my favorite routine planning app because it allows you to set habits and routines in an intuitive way. It allows you to view the progress you're making with habits. And it gives you the most functionality without having to pay anything. Other apps give little functionality before you have to pay.,good
Love it! The app I have been looking for,good
Loved it.. easy tracking.. detailed statistics.. Thank you for this ..,good
Premium version is awesome. Must use app to develop self discipline and to track your activities. Good stats window and satisfying UI.,good
"Cute and functional little organisation app. Used the free version for a couple of months, liked it, transitioned to Premium - it's a one-off payment for a lifetime subscription, thought it was worth it. Clean design, good system. Here's what I think would make the app even better: 1. Setting a duration for tasks, not just habits. 2. Being able to move untimed tasks up and down the list. 3. More task icons! These are just things I would like ideally - love the app regardless!",good
"Love that I can create a habit once, click on everyday and it shows up everyday!! The best part is I have a habit that's has to be done every 15 days and this app allows me to pick how many days between I want this habit to occur!! Best app yet!!!",good
Super duper amazing app .... Exactly what i wanted,good
Exactly what I was looking for. This app really helps me keep track of my habits and it super user friendly. Love it!,good
So nice daily routine app,good
Very Good App..😊👍,good
Good app but its not notifying me in my new phone LG but my old phone it does ring can someone tell me how to fix this problem ? The habitNow team helped me fix the problem it was the feature of battery optimizer on my phone thank you great app!,good
"Highly recommended , it's really working well",good
I love this app because it's really useful for planning,good
"I love this app! It's everything I needed, I use it to manage everything including taking my medications. Paying for premium was totally worth it especially since it's only a one time fee.",good
"Best Habit app. It not only make habits become rontine, it has a task option many do not have. No need for two apps.",good
Love it. The answer of my hope. Thank you HabitNow 🤍,good
It is a very fantastic app and it reminds me to do studies and do my homework...,good
"I love this app. It's like my own pocket-PA. I make notes on habits and when I go back to view, they're not in chronological order. They're ordering by the day of the month regardless of what the month is (DD/MM/YY) e.g. 03/07/2020 then 04/03/2020 then 05/06/2020. I'd change it to Y/M/D but can't see how to. I'll give 5 stars anyway because it is a great app despite this minor but annoying glitch. Is there any way to edit the habits, such as to change the days? I can't find a way to do that.",good
Cool,good
Nice application it was really very useful I did my work on time I was so much free time so that's good news I love it I'llI give u guys 5 🌟 stars. I want another to do app it must have talking alarm and please reply me THANKS FOR THE VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY NICE APP bye,good
Супер,good
It is a practical app and easy to use.,good
Best habit app to date! Has every feature were other apps only have limited features. The only habit app you'll ever need.,good
"This is an excellent app, it has helped organize my life really well. I only wish I could be able to edit tasks after saving them. Otherwise it comes highly recommended.",good
"Perfect app, I like it",good
It works,good
Great option but you must divide your habits in sub-habits to really achieve them. Thanks to developer team. Its a great app.,good
"Great app, very easy to use. Calendar view is amazing!",good
Very easy to use 😄😃,good
Everything I needed in one App.,good
"Love it , just need to increase habits option",good
It is a really useful app,good
"This app is exactly what I was looking for! You can have tasks repeat daily, weekly, monthly, every three days, every Tuesday and Thursday, etc. You can also add one-time tasks that will show up every day on your checklist until you complete it. This has made my daily life so much easier and keeps me from forgetting to do important things. My one suggestion to make the app better would be the ability to drag and drop tasks and habits into a specific order. Besides that, it is GREAT 👍",good
"My life seems to be taking a roadless travelled, I love it.",good
Wow this is what i was exactly looking for. Bought premium on the first day. Add many more features in the coming updates,good
Simple to use,good
"It's a wonderful app , good for setting reminders but I want 'already made plan' feature . That will be nice. Otherwise it's a nice offline app",good
Peter Pan first born creator of existence,good
"Trying to instill better habits in my life. This app has been such a big help, very methodogic and gives me daily reminders to log before I go to bed.",good
Nice app for daily activities...,good
Very good😛👍,good
Love the app only had for 2 days 👍,good
"Just what I needed in a habit tracker. Simply amazing. Only request I have is can we have in-built timer for some habits? Like if I want a track a habit of daily reading a book for 30 minutes, I want to see if I am reading for 30 minutes or less. Thanks.",good
It enurages me to hat want to do in order to develop good healthy habits.,good

"To see the steps for a task, it always requires to open up the task. I want to see all the task with all the steps at a glance. It would be nice if drop-down list of steps is available on tasks (also on the widgets).",poor
"Slow, less friendly, Wunderlist was far better app, which you bought and killed. I am not liking it and finally uninstalling after tolerating it for 8 months.",poor
What more can I say had to change my password cause I forgot and it asks me to change my password again due to questionable activity. Don't want to deal with it anymore its just a darn list who gives a rats behind if someone wants to b view what I'm picking up for dinner they can pick it up for me if they want but not trying to come up with a whole new password so you can make me create another one 10 minutes later.,poor
I can't synchronize my to do list with my devices,poor
I have to log-in/sign-up to use it... I dont want to make any kind of account.,poor
I can't use my old email on my laptop and use a current email on the laptop. The app will not let me use my current email and password.,poor
"Bad sync, unneeded move from wunderlist, unattractive graphics.",poor
In the last update the auto update for lists across multiple devices stopped working.,poor
"Very pointless.not like notion. You need to really improve on the app.Atleast Google keep is a little better,because you can have side checkboxes& notion can have habit checkers, and more.Please improve on alot of features.SORRY IF I TURNED OUT TO BE DISRESPECTFUL📉😵😨😥",poor
Dud,poor
Garbage! Takes a simple concept and turns in to a spam generator.,poor
"After a few weeks, the android app has stopped syncing with the windows app. Useless.",poor
Didn't have a good experience sorry,poor
"Missing lots of features, Predefined reminder dates/times suggestion must be editable!!",poor
"Don't know why but this app just doesn't work. Tried adding a task just 5 minutes from current time and it doesn't work. Well only some times it does(work). Totally disappointed with this, being from Microsoft my expectations were high.",poor
Stupid app keeps kicking me out of my account.,poor
No notification. When I will the app then it will remind me,poor
It's just opening pages forever out lighting images why!,poor
Not syncing properly with Office online,poor
"the widgets don't update, only if i delete them every day and put them back, but in your case they don't update by themselves",poor
Worked good but then it just kicked me out of the app,poor
Worst.,poor
It is not giving me a reminder as a notification on my notification bar it is also not giving me any notification in the form of sound or vibration,poor
"Sharing does not work in ANY way. For basic ToDo its OK, Sharing its Absolute TRASH. If you share a list with somebody and that somebody addicts and item or creates an item you don't see any changes. The person that you share a list with only sees an initial review of your list however no changes are propagated between the owner and sharing destination. And what is even worse is if the sharing destination user updates any tasks that task disappear from The To Do List. that means items disappear",poor
"Wunderlist was a wonderful piece of software that initially continued to work well after being acquired by Microsoft. The conversion to ToDo was ok (some lost features, but initially seemed ok). The Android and desktop app no longer consistently sync. And lately, the app consistently loses my repeating tasks (they simply disappear upon completion), completed recurring tasks still display on My Day, and recurring tasks also lately weirdly create duplicate tasks when repeating. ToDo isn't even close to Wunderlist, unfortunately, so time to move on.",poor
"Wunderlist was a great app and never failed our family. Now that MS has taken over, it's riddled with bugs, lists don't sync, lists can't be shared, etc. Such a shame, this used to be one of my most important apps.",poor
"I like to keep my calendar simple. For me I color code my appts, I don't need time slots. I'd love to find a better app than this one.",poor
1 star for not letting me to try the app without signing in.,poor
"Decided to STOP using it. As I have to add lists MANUALLY to ""My Day"" page. Every planned tasks doesn't AUTOMATICALLY listed on my day page. Every other apps doesn't need to do that time wasting thing of manually adding the lists.",poor
Can't print after last update,poor
Does not work nice interface but faulty doesn't work,poor
"Tried to log in, put my email and psw and only shows loading, i've waited 5 minutes in this screen and nothing happens.",poor
"I loved when first saw it....but the problems it has is very bad. It does not properly sync. I wrote down many things and then opened in my laptop, nothing was there although I clicked sync and connected to internet properly. Still the tasks were not synced to my laptop. Also another disappointing thing is that the remainder doesn't make any sound. It just pops up silently and unnoticeably in the notification bar, so totally useless.",poor
Sync don't work. Can't invite directly and ... Every programmer in this world can do better than this. Wunderlist was a great app I'm very sorry for what happened to it,poor
Login taking so much time,poor
Garbage,poor
No dark mode for widget,poor
"Whenever tried to login, it says their is some problem try after sometime. Advise do not waste ur date on this app...",poor
Not ready for prime time,poor
"Would have given this app 5 stars but for 3 issues. 1. The ""Notes"" icon keeps appearing next to reminders. 2. The tasks do not appear in order of time, but alphabetically. This is really annoying. 3. The tasks do not appear on the calender, which is also really annoying.",poor
"The daily reminder for any task only works if the task is tapped ""completed"" either through notification (completed/snooze) or through App even if the task is actually not completed . If you swipe the notification without tapping on ""completed"", the daily reminder stops. This is funny. The ""daily reminder"" should continue daily whether the task for a particular day is completed or not completed.",poor
"I hate that ""Note"" symbol showing up on tasks even I didn't put any notes and that makes me go crazy because I have to open each and every task to see that I have put notes. It worked fine when I downloaded it. Please fix it. It really annoying.",poor
"The perfect sample of how a well working app (Wunderlist) was totally spoiled. When a group list is created, it does not sync the list between users, so it does not work for group lists. When problem was reported to support I received an automated response by someone who doesn't understand English and was trying to convince me that I don't have a problem, rather then trying to help.",poor
"This is the only Microsoft app with no support for proper status bar and navigation bar colouring and transparency, the devs working on this app are lazy af. And what's with that sad attempt at a widget, it's hideous.",poor
"Granted, I just downloaded the app, but I have yet to find anything useful about it. Copy/pasting in and then reorganizing a basic task list took me about a half hour (seriously? No drag and drop?) and I haven't been able to figure out how to share a task list with someone else. If I can't share the task list, why is there an ""assigned to me"" toggle? Instructions on the MS website seem to be referencing a completely different version than the one I have. Utterly useless and frustrating.",poor
"Almost perfect. If you could make option so tasks tabs can be little smaller, that is more compact, it would be perfect app. It would save screen space, and fit more tabs on screen.",poor
"All tasks now appear with a ""note"" icon, even if there is no note there. Completely unreliable with the reminders of repeated tasks: -Sometimes the ""remind me at"" goes blank for no apparent reason. -Check the task after midnight of its due date and you won't get reminded of this task the next day -The app either forgets ""remind me"" or ""repeat"" part after one cycle of task done).",poor
Why suggest tomorrow option in widget,poor
"OK sorry, I am not sure whether you are serious or deliberately misunderstanding me. Wunderlist could share lists with people inside my organisation (i.e. colleagues) or outside my organisation (I.e. family). It seems ToDo can ONLY share lists with people that are within my domain AND have a Microsoft account. Will this ever be changed? Please see the thousands of requests for this feature on many forums. I cannot believe you actually misunderstand this request.",poor
I can't create an account,poor
Pants,poor
Notes sign is in ALL notes. All over the internet. YET. Microsoft NOT fixing. WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO FIX THE BUG? IT HAS BEEN A MONTH THAT WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING THIS.,poor
Terrible I'm sure I'm not the only one saying this but I'll add mine. It used to be a great app as wunderlist but is now terrible. I can only assume its intentional to force people elsewhere because there's some money to be made. An added recent quirk is it doubling any hylerlink in the notes whenever you close the keyboard ( a more insane quirk i couldn't dream up). Don't bother.,poor
"UPDATED: I used to have this rated 4 stars until the most recent update which has issues with website addresses. Now every time you go into a note with a web address it doubles it each time you write anything and exit. PREVIOUS 4 STAR REVIEW: I was an hugh supporter of Listmaster, but they went out of business. This app does even more, except I would like to see some type of an import / export feature using csv files (for file backup).",poor
"Horrible app, requires a full Microsoft account to use and when you try and log in it'll link every one of MS accounts from history. Ended up deleting everything; To-Do, my MS account etc. Microsoft are truly a terrible company when it comes to accounts, it was in 2000 and it still is 20 years on.",poor
Update made it so that every entry has a note attached and doesn't have the ability to actually edit the note on android. Doesn't happen on the PC version of the app.,poor
Multiple bugs in the Andriod and windows versions. No one responds to the Uservoice and Helpshift bug posts. Seems like Microsoft has not invested properly in the Dev team,poor
"It was working great, until a few days later. I opened my phone one day to see if I have any activities to do/submit today, but it says that I have to sign in to my account, but U NEVER SIGNED IT OFF!!! And when I try to sign back in, IT NEVER LETS ME SIGN BACK IN. No matter how much or what I method I try to sign in and recover my account. I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED. I shouldn't even be giving it one star!! That's how disappointed I am, but since this won't let post my review without a rating...",poor
"Lowered the score after seeing no highly needed feature updates after 8 months. Had to switch from Wunderlist. To Do -still- lacks functions which make Wunderlist so great. Importing worked well, but sharing previously shared lists required me to make a new 'personal' account - this wasn't an issue before. All is set up now and the app -still- feels limited still. Most of all, why switch? Why not just rename Wunderlist to say 'Microsoft Wunderlist?",poor
"does not respect privacy, I miss good old days of Wunderlist",poor
"Everytime ask for log in and says log in server issues ,whereas other apps works best offline and no need of log in",poor
Forced on us as wonderlist was stolen,poor
"Microsoft is trash, they removed the full screen editing option. Now it's just another useless note app I won't use.",poor
"Would be 5 Stars but does not have option for recurrence. Due dates for more than ""today"" is not working. There is no shame also in adding nice and convenient Calendar options from Outlook or Microsoft's other software options",poor
"This app was perfectly fine before Microsoft got its hands on it, I used it for years for pretty much everything, it was perfect! Now I cant share lists with people unless they are in my organization, lists don't sync, or just hang whenever I try to force it to sync, people don't receive my requests within a list. This app is now a complete waste of space on my phone, and after years of wanderlist I am now forced to try find a new app.",poor
Not so good,poor
I miss wunderlist. It was much better.,poor
Very bad,poor
Anybody who selected 5 starts CLEARLY did not EVER use Wunderlist. But it is IMPOSSIBLE not to make the comparison consideration for a review. This company plays foul. You buy out an excellent competitor for this app you are pushing and then rather than improve on it you produce something unquestionably inferior. Dastardly deed and regardless of your improvements there are others out there I'll choose. You won't get my support full stop. 1. I can't add a task and have it emailed to the team member. They have to keep checking ToDo all during the day wasting time. 2. We lost the crucial COMMENTS section. This allowed a team member to provide a status update or send a query. This had a date and time stamp which gave a history that helped to determine the pace of work on the task. It allowed the team leader to communicate easily and give feedback. Now we have to go to a different app like email or whatsapp to respond. 3. Can't sort the tasks according to TEAM MEMBER. So I gotta scroll and scroll to find all tasks I gotta talk to a team member about. There's more but out of words,poor
"MS again acquired and destroyed a good product wunderlist. Use to use wunderlist a lot. Once wunderlist bought by Microsoft, wunderlist user was forced to migrate. There is a sharp decline on how often I use the app now. The widget works poorly. From time to time there are sign-in problem .",poor
Sign up and login does not work,poor
The stopped working the next day i downloaded it and got signed out and when i tried signing in...it said problem with my account duh,poor
"Bargin bin Wunderlist. We had and enjoyed Wunderlist for years. Microsoft bought it and we were migrated over with the assurance it was justvas good. Nope. It sucks. Tasks assigned on the same list, due the same day, with the same reminder settings dont show up on a master listv of tasks. On to the next one.",poor
Crashes suddenly,poor
Good,poor
"Task completed and ticked, but it didn't disappear when i log in the next time. This made me done the task twice which incurred severe loss to me. This happened for many times and the error are not solved. I do not recommend this to do apps.",poor
Bring back Wunderlist you cowardly knaves,poor
"Edit: originally 3/5 because it is a nice app with one major flaw. Microsoft commented on my original review saying to contact customer service via email I did and they told me to look at one setting but my phone doesn't have that setting. They responded back basically ""o well. That's all we got"" and said it's my phone's fault. Like really? Piss poor support. Especially considering the app works fine for an extended period but then will stop. Can't be the setting they recommended.",poor
"The app is useless, took all my tasks and now denied me access ... forcing me to sign create a Microsoft account",poor
"You are not letting us synchronize with any 3rd-party calendars. It is not easy to add any other people to tasks or checklists, either. Stupid Java and Python. WORTHLESS!!!",poor
"Won't let me sign in with my Microsoft account. I've clicked create a new one as well and it tells me the domain I'm trying to use is reserved. Like, I know! I was trying to sign in with it. Uninstalling.",poor
"Brilliant App! Bad for Dyslexia, Irlen Syndrome, Accessibility - WHITE COLOUR IN TASK BOXES. Please remove or give option to change the white colour fill in task boxes. Even if the white task boxes are grey would be better - but ideally option to change colour fill.

But the white task boxes fill the screen!",poor
If I edit something in the note then pressed back button it will save without confirmation dialog & will lost those words if it happened by accident!,poor
It was a huge thing I lost my data along with my account,poor

Bring back wunderlist Inconsistencies with being able to assign users to list. Some lists not identifying users who have already been added and are active on the list.,poor

Terrible.,poor

"Love how you can set one off reminders and reoccurring tasks. This allows me to combine my daily routine with the tasks I need to do, all in one place. However there is no way to see your daily tasks in chronological order, automatically. The my day section requires you to manually add all tasks (despite any due dates); the today section in planned area sorts each day alphabetically, so you don't know which task is due first or when as doesn't show. Issue in both Android andd windows.",poor
Keeps blocking me every time change password.very frustrating,poor
Why am I only allowed to be signed into one device at a time and need to go through the process of signing in every single time I try to check it or add something on another device?,poor
I've been trying to get start the app but it is not working at all....popping the same temporary problem on screen....is it really a helpful app?,poor
"Microsoft bought an already mature application, spent 4 years working on it, and this is all they have to show for it??? Perhaps they need more than 2 high school students to support this product. Poor integration with Outlook. Most of the Outlook Tasks fields are not visible in To Do so you can't see the task details when using To Do. To Do task notes (sub tasks) are not synced with Outlook Tasks so you can't see your To Do task details when you are in Outlook. Look elsewhere.",poor
Doesn't have comments as wunderlist does,poor
What the hell wrong with you!😡how many will you take recover the account?Go to hell!you clumsy!,poor
I still feel this app has ruined Wunderlist after using Wunderlist for so many years and this Todo has so many bugs.,poor
Why Do I have to sign In again even tho I did not even log out in the first place It is very Inconvenient for a to do list,poor
Appalling product,poor
"Repeat reminders don't show notifications once you've completed it. If you set a weekly reminder to take your trash down to the road, once you get the first notification and complete it, it doesn't notify you the next week. This app is broken, FIX IT!!!!!",poor
So boring .,poor
I miss wunderlist's aggregated notifications,poor
You have to create a Microsoft account to use the app.,poor
To hard to sign-in. Make it easier to sign in. I wasn't able to sign in or use the app. Uninstalled.,poor
So there are lot of bugs.. If I do not mark reminder as completed then it goes away from the notifications when the date changes.. It's a daily reminder so I don't get notification next day as well untill I open app and mark that reminder as completed,poor
Standard above average,poor
The app is easy to use and is very effective. I never experienced any technical failure or downtime.,poor
Registration is required,poor
WHY ISN'T MONDAY THE START OF THE WEEK?,poor
It wors fine on my phone but its terrible on my desktop not all my sub information on a tab is showing this is the United States you should not be able to put a product out if it doesn't work properly you think because we're not paying for these apps you can just put anything out .,poor
Long time fan and user of wunderlist. Switched to do last year before the app was fully shut down. And been mostly happy until last week when To Do started deleting tasks.,poor
"Does not sync flagged emails, I can see it online but not on the mobile app",poor
Terrible experience with this. My lists transferred from Wunderlist (which never caused me any problems) and now To Do keeps losing my lists so I have to reinstall all the time. Sort it out or I'm using another app,poor
Garbage. Find something else if you need to share lists with someone else.,poor
"Does not synchronise, between devices or users",poor
Tasks that i want them to be daily should appear on my day Spontaneously I'm tired of adding them every time,poor
Can't get it to make a sound when some one adds a something,poor
Doesn't work in miui 12,poor
"Um lixo. Esses caras da Microsoft extinguiram o Wunderlist, que era mais simples e mais amigável que este lixo e ainda impediram a revenda do Wunderlist para is antigos donos. Desidratando este traste de app. Perdi todas as minhas tarefas na transição. VTNC Microsoft.",poor

Very bad app what i think but this app is wrost,poor
"Since Cortana is going away on my phone and Invoke speakers, going to move onto another one supported by smart speakers",poor

Won't sync with my computer despite repeated attempts. I miss Wunderlist,poor
"Would be great if I could receive notifications. Confirmed I have notification on but still won't receive them, which makes app useless. Do not download until they fix this issue, which is widespread.",poor
"Why am I being logged out of the application after every one day? It is so annoying now. Even when putting the right the password, message pops up saying ""Something wrong with the Microsoft account"", any explanation?

Not sure why this is not available to an individual's office account. We pad it just the business or school account did.,poor

You have to use an account.,poor
"Find good app. Buy good app. Copy some features from it. Ignore all others. New app doesn't do half of what the old app does. Kill the old app to make people use new app. People move to other third party app. 10/10 development strategy, well done Microsoft.",poor
cannot use without logging in to microsoft account,poor
"Widget forces My Day list. My day is frustrating and useless. Wanderlist, both the app AND widget were amazing and you've totally screwed it up. Give us back what actually worked!! Please!!!",poor
You should Add time parameter also. Means if I pointed out important work of day but in important work what time I should assign and when to do should also be visible below that work not in the form of symbol but in the form of time and data get arranged according to time.,poor
I got this because you cant set voice reminders in cortana anymore. But you cant set them in this app either. Confusing layout and doesn't have the functionality of a personal. assistant. Trash.,poor
"Not as good as its predecessor Wunderlist, but serviceable. Needs integration with Outlook: flagged messages should appear in Tasks, and dated tasks should appear in Outlook's calendar. Come on guys, this is basic stuff.",poor
Doesn't sync with my wife. Essentially as useful as notepad. Wanderlist was a significantly better app.,poor
Useless since I can't put exact time for a deadline,poor
Needs a lot of improvement. Suggestion or feedback shared is waste as no one replies.,poor
Useless,poor
"Worst reminder app ever, big companies run by dumb people. The app does not remind on time event after putting in the exact time. Dumbest people",poor
I'm not able to login since last 3 months. Highly unsatisfied,poor
Microsoft killed a great app (Wunderlist) by taking out the core functionality of integrating it with calendars,poor
"""your favorite features are all in To Do"" - blatant lie, To Do doesn't have email notifications like Wunderlist, for example. upd 18/05/20 - and now reminders left (accidentally or intended) overnight are simply disappearing, in the morning you won't see any To Do reminders! I'm really disappointed! upd 19.08.20 - still without any improvements, no email notifications and disappearing notifications after 00:00, I wish I could rate ZERO star",poor
Bring back Cortana!,poor
"This app is fantastic! Except...I cannot manually rearrange my ""Important"" list. When that is updated, I will come back to leave a 5 star review. Until then, the app will always be lacking.",poor
"Coming from Wunderlist I really tried to like Microsoft To-do, but it's horrible! The layout is so full and depressing. I hate the whole design: colours, choice of font, amount of space wasted. Wunderlist was so much better. My Day is the most useless thing ever. It's cleared out each day, so don't add anything when you're going to bed and want to plan tomorrow. It's all gone after midnight. Why wake something that worked so well for years and destroy it? Uninstalling this app.",poor
"How do i only see tasks due for today i see that the ""my day"" tab has an option to add the days tasks is there a way to make this automatic? Sick of seeing tasks that are not for today but the next day or even weeks in the future just piled together also i have daily repeating tasks that when i complete todays task it gets replaced with tommorrows which makes it really hard to know if i've done todays when they look the exact same except for a tiny ""tommorrow"" at the bottom of the button helpp",poor
Shouldn't need to login,poor
Aak,poor
"You could just migrate the data from Wunderlist and let me just log in with just an approval like how it works in other app migrations. I already used the weird interface on my PC to migrate and now I can't log in from my phone. I have all my data in Wunderlist, and I am forced to use this new nonsense app, and additionally I have to do extra work as if I chose not to use Wunderlist anymore because I found something much better.

"In general this app works great, but since it switched from Wunderlist to Todo, it now logs out frequently and then the widget will no longer show your lists until you open the whole app again. It happens every few days and across multiple phones. Please fix this",poor
You have to pay and install another app (outlook) on another machine (windows only PC) to be able to undelete a list.. Mistakes will be punished!,poor
Wunderlist was so much better. I can't find a way to delete the my day and tasks feature. I just want lists.,poor
Why do you have to sign in at microsoft account,poor
"It's OK as a basic to do list if you're not interested in prioritising your tasks for the day. You can set a due date but no time. And you can sort by due date.

I'll stick to using Ayoa, where I can easily drag each item on my list into the order I want. And much more besides.",poor
"There's a simple app on playstore named ""To do list"" and it does what it says. Yours, my god.. It is so terrible. It can't even do a simple task. For eg: few tasks that i have set on repeat doesn't even show automatically in the ""My day"" tab. I mean why not.",poor
Many problems with this app..,poor
Need an undo button!,poor
i can't use it for a month because email was wrong. that's insane,poor
I dont understand the idea of an account. Just give me an offline program,poor
Reminders DON'T work.,poor
Worst app ever!!! During the import from Wonderlist it removed all of my data. Leave it to MS to screw up a great app.,poor
It doesn't run on oneplus 7t Pro,poor
"Seems alright so far but since there's not a single setting for notifications, easy 1 star. Some lists I'm part of, i don't want or need notifications every single time something is added.

"Completely unreliable. I am a tech savy guy and I know my apps. But damn Microsoft's software is degrading. This app just skips certain reminders. I miss events and tasks. It's nice to have everything on my PC as well, but it's unreliable. This is probably the third Micrsoft app I am uninstalling.",poor
I dont wanna log in with stupid micro acc,poor
"Agree with other reviewers - Wunderlist worked much better. Have issues with items not synching between devices, takes a long time to manually synch, uploading attachments to items doesn't seem to work without restarting the app, the Windows pc version is particularly poor. Appears Microsoft have mucked around with the code base and broken a really good app :(",poor
It's not Wunderlist. Took a good app and ruined it. Just opened it up (July 2020) no sync. Try later. Huh? Microsoft garbage?,poor
Need be online every time start,poor
"Switched over from wunderlist. This app isn't as smooth to use and last night I put 2 things on my to do list with a reminder at 9:00am. At 10:00am I went into the app and that is when the reminders showed up in my notification bar. Previous reminders have also showed up with 2 hr delays, don't rely on this app solely for important reminders.",poor
"MS To Do is practically USELESS! Restricting access solely to MS account holders severely limits any ability to coordinate tasks/punch lists with non MS users (ie. customers, collaborators, vendors). It is inconvenient and UNNECESSARY to require the creation of a MS account in order to use an app that was previously available universally (as Wunderlist). This restriction was intentionally added. Who's genius idea was this?",poor
Terrible,poor
"Inferior to wunderlist in every way. Sync works poorly, planned smart list doesn't group by day which is very frustrating, search function is poor.",poor
Too bad app not working since the day i started using... The apps again and again saying some prob occurred please check 8n browser.....,poor
Not good,poor

requires microsoft account. deal breaker.,poor
"Very unreliable. I have a daily recurring task, it is synced between phone and desktop, but the reminder doesn't fire on either platform.",poor
"Update: After years and tons of my feedback reports on playstore, MS Feedback and Twitter you still haven't solve the main problem this app has: background sync doesn't work... Are you kidding me? The app has an awesome design but without background reminder sync is simply USELESS (I've got a OnePlus 6 but everything except this app work perfectly, background sync for everything too, so the problem is this useless app) Another awesome and clear from bug work Microsoft, well done!",poor
Totally useless - sharing lists does not work.,poor
"Some reminders get missed and I don't know why, mostly those that must repeat.",poor

"Why on earth would you create an app that doesn't link with your calendar??? The To Do app is straightforward on Android app and desktop version. HOWEVER, there's no way to link it to Microsoft 365 Calendar! It's within the same suite of Microsoft 365 and yet, you can't schedule on either one to show up on the other. That's asinine! ! You would think this would be a primary feature, but the Product Manager must be sleep at the wheel. It's mystifying.",poor
"App is okay, but I am missing the Categories. Also a view were I can group by Category is missing.",poor
"Synching, when it happens takes forever! which means that when I make a change in one device, I do not see those changes on my other devices for a long time, if I see them at all.",poor
"Medium. Would be better if everyone had the feature to create todos from flagged email in outlook. Without that, I don't need outlook on my phone.",poor
"This app is good but the problem is reminders do not pop on the set date & time, which destroys the purpose. Most of the time it doesn't pop at all. So is the case with Repeat. Apart from Repeating daily, monthly & yearly, it would be appreciated if we had repeats for particular dates in a month/year. As not all tasks repeat in a fixed interval.",poor
I installed it in m laptop and it can't even launch.. The program continues to crash,poor
I very beginning I can easily add by tasks list i.e shopping list to home screen of my mobile but know this is not working please fix the issue,poor
It doesn't gives a reminder of of my tasks and planned items at all,poor
Sadly Microsoft have a history of replacing perfectly efficient apps with less efficient ones. They have purchased and killed off the immensely popularWunderlist no doubt hoping they could transfer it's users to their vastly inferior product. I have just give it a third try out but Todo is still a 2nd rate'camel' of an implementation. I have been using remember the milk which is fairly excellent but will move to Aoya which may suit me better.,poor
"It does not provide any notification even when a time is specified. No notifications, no alarms. Sometimes this drawback takes away the positive parts of this app.",poor
Does job,poor
"UPDATE: Just lost my notes on my todo. Super annoying, as it were important technical details. Also keeps having sync issues with my laptop, subtasks do not synchronize. OLD: 3 star, because the date on my phone does not show the weekday of a date, like on desktop, but this is something absolutely essential for me.",poor
There's no option to export my task list if I want to migrate to another app. Or just dump my task data into a CSV. I'm out of todo to avoid getting locked in. Google is less evil that way. I can move out of its ecosystem any time I want and export all my data.,poor
"La aplicación funciona bien pero el widget tiene algunos problemas cuando se cambia de pantalla o se abre otra aplicación, este deja de funcionar y ya no permite abrir la app desde el widget, tampoco permite cambiar entre listas cuando eso sucede.",poor
I had to switch from Wunderlist and one of the most important features no longer exists..the ability to duplicate a list. I have a couple long lists with sub tasks that needs to be replicated on a regular basis so this is a deal breaker for me.,poor
"The effect of reminder is not seen, what went wrong ,?",poor
"It's okay. Works well for short lists but gets clunkier as lists get longer. For example, grocery lists become unbearable trying to list everything in aisle order. Takes ages to drag everything into place. Needs a way to keep groupings within lists.",poor
"I really liked it when a list could have completed and uncompleted mixed alphabetically together. Now it is back like the much poorer Wunderlist method, with the two separated, uncompleted at top completed at bottom. Much harder to reuse lists. I have gone back to an earlier superior version. Sadly it won't sync with my wife's version of the app on iphone. Change it back!",poor
TRUE AMOLED DARK MODE is needed (amoled/fully black pixels off) not DARK GRAY.,poor
Since a few weeks there's a bug that adds a blank note to every item you add. Highly annoying as this makes actual notes no longer stand out. Was 5 stars before that bug though.,poor
"Great when it works. However far too often it loses all my Tasks and goes blank. Happened today on my Android phone on Aug 14th at 7:39 AM BST. Can be fixed by uninstalling/reinstalling but given regularity (this is the 4th time in 6 months) I suspect due to release cadence. Please sort this bug, as I rely on this heavily. UPDATE: After a few months of glitch free use, its happening again over past 3-4 days & this morning whilst Synching. Support ticket raised with detailed steps.",poor
Struggling with a new feature that suddenly appeared where if I post a task it comes with a sticker. How do I remove this?,poor
"I haven't been receiving notifications for reminders set in Task, Weekly Core, My Day or nothing on my phone until I opened the app and the notifications started to appear. Please correct me if I'm wrong, are push notifications only available when the app is open in the background? 🤔",poor
"App is great, but there is no sound or alarm to remind you of tasks. Popup is not enough, some kind of sound/songs is needed.",poor
Widget not displaying todos properly!!!!,poor
Home screen widget doesn't load when the phone starts.,poor
Loved it originally but can't stand the little page icons that clutter my lists now.,poor
"When I modify the tasks online they don't automatically sync in the phone Because of this problem I forget about a task I had to do It can't sync with google calendar For the rest, it's very well done and very nice",poor
"Very basic tool, missing many features, like searches, lists of overdue tasks, reminders which really ring the alarm.",poor
Need improve 1. Add the option to Use Gmail for flagged task 2. Incorporate a pomodoro option to do the tasks 3. Improve the widget appearance,poor
Efficient!,poor
I need to manage blocks of time to schedule it,poor
"Migrated from Wunderlist because I had to and a feature I absolutely want and don't have is notifications of new tasks or completed tasks. Microsoft makes this feature available for ""Personal"" accounts but not a team, corporate one. How stupid is that??? Microsoft assumes work tasks don't require notifications too??",poor
"Deal breaker: I can only set a due date and not an exact time. I.E., I can only do Jan 01 and NOT Jan 01 at 12pm.",poor
"Every item shows a note now, even without a note being entered",poor
"This app only notifies me of one reminder at a time, so if I don't clear the notification, it stops notifying me of other reminders. It also doesn't allow scheduling more than 1 reminder for a task on a given day. ""Repeat"" doesn't help. You can't duplicate a task to make a 2nd reminder either, I have to make another task and manually copy and paste the name, notes, and date. Notification syncing is broken for me too, I have to clear every reminder on both my computer and phone every time.",poor
Assigning tasks to multiple users is missing which is very much needed. Wunder list looks much easy to work than this.,poor
"Was great, but line breaks in 'notes' section is making unusable. Please fix immediately or I'll find another tool, which would be a shame :(",poor
"Makes huge flawed assumptions on how you are using this. The share menu forces you to add to My Day by default which involves extra clicks to change. No way to set default share to list, no way to get rid of My Day lost, and other built in clutter lists.",poor
"A shortcut icon within it to be placed for inviting this app to our colleagues, friends to bring under a group. Thereafter he will take up in that particular group.",poor
Whenever I sign it always show something went wrong plz sign in again this same problem occurs in other Microsoft app also with me,poor
I just went into my app and somehow everything was lost! I had to import everything again from Wunderlist but it was the old lists so I lost some REALLY IMPORTANT INFO and I'm pissed.,poor
After the last update I can no longer get notification automatically. I get notification only when I open the app. Please help resolve it. It is a great app.,poor
"The only reason I downloaded the app was for the completion sound , which doesn't exist for me !",poor
"Не работают уведомления на повторяющихся задачах, постоянно пропускаются задачи",poor
Sick and tired of suggestions being made by many of us in the forums and being ignored by you devs. Will use another app instead.,poor
"Planned apps don't show up un My Day. Also, sorting between future tasks, today's tasks and previous unachieved ones easily gets confusing.",poor
Asking for sign in frequently,poor
I need dupplicate task function,poor
Hate having to sign in Microsoft to use MY TO DO LIST. It was great when it was Wunderlist.,poor
Because I though that the teams are related to this app. I downloaded but I was wrong,poor
"Still handles only the most basic task repeat functions. Cannot handle ""the second Sunday every X months"" or ""last day of the month"" scanarios. Interface is only so-so, does not show task times at a glance in main Tasks screen",poor
"No more widget, why ?",poor
The flagged email list has items in it that I ha e not flagged and also are not in my email account. I guess your software has been hacked or has a problem. All the emails are what I would call spam. Unwanted.,poor
"Ex-Wunderlist user here. Widget goes to My Day all the time and gets non responsive, until you resize it or add it again. This has been bugging me for months. Same issue on 3 different phones I used",poor
Reminders don't popup so I keep forgetting to do things. Unless your at a PC (where I see outlook reminders anyway) it's pretty useless,poor
Crappy microsoft log in. No matter what I did I could not log in. I ended up downloading an older apk outside playstore with an older form of log in. I successfully logged in with the old version and then updated the app through playStore. The only reason I give 2 stars instead of 1 is that the app is great in every other way.,poor
Sk aftar,poor
Why can I snooze only up to an hour???? Where is a 4-hour snooze option? And 1-day option?? I also can't sort tasks by reminder date. Most of my tasks don't have a due date but they have a reminder date. I need to be able to sort by the remainder date!,poor
Nothing more than a simple to do list without any decent widgets. Nobody wants to open the app every time they want to create a new task or check something they already did,poor
"Although this is supposed to be an improvement on wunderlist, you are unable so share lists unless a person has a microsoft office account or are in your network. They dont allow it to be used for personal accounts.",poor
I miss the integration with Cortana. Used to be able to talk while driving to add a task. This requires too much hand interaction. Even simple apps like shopping list on android allow voice input.,poor
"Frequently reminds me on the wrong days: of a reminder is set to Monday, Wednesday and Friday, it will sometimes change to remind me on Sunday instead of Monday, or Thursday instead of Wednesday. Would be nice to be able to swipe a reminder away and have it change to remind you at the next reminder time - instead of just cancel. Also, if you have reminders listed in the notification area and Android updates the app, you lose the reminders and you have to manually find and rest them.",poor
Please add today's task to my day automatically. Now it has to do it manually. Can you add calendar events in to do .,poor
"I kinda like it, but I miss a lot of options. Few suggestions : more options on repeating task e.g. repeat every last friday, add an alert for the person task is assigned to, show tasks that has due date of today in ""My day"", have an option to let person the task is assigned to edit the task and option to choose your week start.",poor
Prefer wunderlist! This is a sad adaptation and should have never replaced an app that worked so well.,poor
Look so simple but not. Its really confused to do i ever use. How can i focused when i finised 1 thing for my daily routine and still there with schedule for different day.,poor
Notification improper or null,poor
It looks great but will not allow importing via a Google software/ platform.. it works only for Wunderlist. 🥺. Why? Wish we could use it.,poor
Daily reminder doesn't work perfectly.,poor
"Why do you require accounts and passwords for a to-do list app? I just want an easy grocery list app, and you've gone and made it difficult to use, and added a bunch of unnecessary complications.",poor
"Fix the widget, way too buggy, unusable",poor
Why this so doesn't remind me?,poor
This app has a great ui and ux but there's one thing that really makes it useless. I'd doesn't sync in the background so I add a tskl via desktop it'll probably not show on my phone unless i open the app on my phone. It makes the app risky if you need to count on your reminders. Another problem is the time suggestion when you create a task is always behind the keyboard and it's hard to use it like that/,poor
It mixes todays completed task by Tomorrow. Which is really bad experience and gives no happiness after completing a task. Todays completion must be removed and tomorrows list must be visible by tomorrow. Not today. Fix it.,poor
"What is annoying about this app is a fact that Android, W10, web app have different functionality. Web: I can color/categorize tasks but it's not available on W10/Android Web+Android: add new tasks on top option is available but it's missing in W10 app. Another issue: my widgets are empty almost every time I unlock my phone. Almost every time I have to launch app to get them working.",poor
"Keep having microsuck account issues, and it takes me 20 minutes to sign in to the damn thing every time I tried to use it. Almost cost me my marriage. I hate you ass holes.",poor
You'd thing MS can come up with something better. Very basic. You can't view tasks in your calendar. You can specify task start and end time. Recurring tasks sometimes don't respawn properly.,poor
"A bit too bare bones for me, but I assume if you use your Microsoft account for business a lot, you may like this.",poor
"@Microsoft you've made wunderlist worse, where is the comments feature on each task, that was a win for wunderlist and you just killed it",poor
"Mostly OK. Needs option to disallow delete of notifications. Only when the notification is Snoozed or marked as Completed should the notification be cleared. Also, once the notification is deleted there is no way to then go into the app and set a snooze time for the task to realert.",poor
"Great app, but we should be able to customize list image from our device and customize notifications ringtone, anyway it is a good app, it would be great if you add this",poor
"Big Bug, How can u miss this. When we search by name, it just searches the notes within the lists created. It does search group names, it doesn't search the list title. It searches only the notes (that are within the list) how stupid is that.",poor
"No, because there is no recycle bin. Which is really uncomfortable and insecure. So please add the recycle bin. Which will prevent me from accidentally deleting.",poor
Can't Sync I am unable to sync my phone account to PC account,poor
"Can't choose notification tone, has to share the sms tone which is confusing",poor
"Horrible app. I'm a big Microsoft fan for their products, but Google keep is 100 times better.",poor
"I'm disappointed, having lost my data twice because there is a serious lacuna in its program. When I delete a 'daily' item after completing it, it should go into the 'completed' list and its next scheduled occurrence immediately appear in the current list. But at times it doesn't happen like that, and if I've deleted it from the completed list even after some hours, it just disappears for ever. Seems that this action is server-dependent rather than being localized, and on the mercy of internet.",poor
Doesn't respect silent mode.,poor
Repeated to do list do not appear on My day. I missed few. That option should have been there,poor
MS has screwed up wunderlist the same as to skype.... So clunky and average poorly thought out; should have just changed wunderlists logo and colour scheme. The desktop version is slow (10s) to respond. You can be doing changes on the desktop and it get jammed up with app.,poor
"As smart and skilled microsoft employees are this is a great app bu needs a lot of tweaks to be top notch. You camt change the name of a list you create, the completed or i should say deleted items in a list is stupid. If i delete items they should be gone not kept in a completed list that just grows and no delete all button and or not even a choice in settings to either delete items forever without a completed list or to have a completed list that grows and grows single item delete is dumb",poor
App is great for the people who forget their tasks. I will be grateful if the company adds alarm reminders in this app.,poor
Not easy to use. And doesn't do a good job of keeping reminders,poor
I guess once you get the instructions you realize that a calendar app preinstalled is more effective.,poor
Como que eu configuro uma tarefa para ser realizada todas as terças e quartas? Se não é possível fazer isso adicionando apenas uma tarefa precisa melhorar urgentemente,poor
"Desktop and web version is slow, awkward, and useless. App for phone is good. As soon as I have time, I will switch to something else. Makes me miss Wunderlist",poor
"Love the app, the synchronization with desktop and shared To Do lists...... BUT this app is almost useless because the reminders don't create notifications if you haven't opened the app for more than a day. More than a dozen times I've checked and rechecked the Android app optimization settings to ensure that Android is not putting this app to sleep. I've cleared cache, data and uninstalled and reinstalled. Still this app will not reliably generate notifications.",poor
Missing features from Wunderlist. Might need to find a new app.,poor
"Much slower than Wunderlist, frequent issues with sync (20 seconds to sync after the website is already loaded??) between Android phone and browser version.",poor
Wont sync w my crew. I have to cut and paste lists. Wunderlist was seemless,poor
"Widget is horrible. Keeps switching to ""my day"" and won't allow me to change it. Really expected better from Microsoft.",poor
Sync between PC and Android app is very slow! Wunderlist was better. Moving to Google Tasks now. Microsoft ruined a good thing.,poor
The App has a lot of functionality but what is the use of flagging your emails but you cannot open the email messages from Microsoft To Do directly in Outlook? It worked well in Wunderlist but since Wunderlist was transferred to Microsoft To Do it doesn't work anymore.,poor
"Good thing it's free, else who would pay? As a fan of Microsoft products, the development of this app is disappointing. It's nothing but average. If the developers can just pick the top task management apps in the play store and add their features into this Todo app, perhaps the development could be accelerated. But right now, it's just like every other low-end Todo apps available, not robust, not feature rich, not exceptional.",poor
Difficult login forces work or school address. Lost Wunderlist lists as a result,poor
Wunderlist was better,poor
Does not store none tasks information well.,poor
Great app but will have to uninstall if they don't sync with google calendar or include a calendar!,poor
"Bring back Wunderlist! This app has failed to link lists over and over. We find ourselves trying to relink lists, but it still doesn't work. Since this has changed from Wunderlist, it's a huge disappointment. Find a better app. Also, you can't silence it when someone is checking off a linked list (when it does work). Super annoying. I expected more from Microsoft.",poor
"Nice interface and it syncs across my devices. However the widget constantly crashes on both, P30 Pro, Oneplus 7T Pro.",poor
"Widget misbehaves, it keeps switching to ""My day"" and stops reacting to any taps when it does",poor
Thanks for ruining Wunderlist you jackasses,poor
Romantic,poor
Can't sort via categories. Importance level doesn't sync well. Basically syncing problems all around. Creating new lists don't show in Outlook proper.,poor
"Still have it as a temporary solution to keep my Wunderlist todos, but the laggy widget is the show stopper. If you've got used to an almost instant Wunderlist widget sync, just forget about it, most of the time you will need to sync manually",poor
Doesn't auto add to My Day schedule wise. Repeat reminder doesn't work either.,poor
Missing the widget for iOS A to-do/reminder app is incomplete without a widget. Otherwise 5 stars.,poor
Just like wunderlist except worse !! Laggy update of list from one device to any.,poor
"I absolutely love this app & pc program. To be able to keep constant notes between work then mobile in my pocket is fantastic... Until I discovered, I'm not experiencing sync in real time. So down to 2 star and my suggestion to get the app to 5-stars would be if each input would automatically be visibly dated & if real time sync actually was real- time. Needed vital info and thought I could just check the note on my smart phone but, this has not been the case. Wasted a lot of my time & nothing.",poor
Doesn't sync well with my laptop,poor
Desktop widget stops functioning every minute!!,poor
"When I went to create an account, I would fill everything out and then I would have to start over. Couldn't even use the app",poor
"Would be nice if they'd show you overdue tasks, I missed quite a few tasks because I wasn't reminded. Leaving feedback is hard and annoying, too many extra steps.",poor
Widget continues to stop working nothing shows up until I resize it.,poor
"Widget has been broken with the latest update, keeps reverting back to the My Day view and then once it does that the button at the top left doesn't work anymore and so can't be switched to show other lists without removing the widget and recreating it, please fix!",poor
This is by far the best To-Do app. I gave it 2 stars because it enforces us to use Microsoft Account for sharing the lists.,poor
"Find another app. Wunderlist was much better. When you sort alphabetically then prioritize an item, it doesn't move to the top of the list. Wunderlist would allow sorting and when it was starred, move to the top.",poor
Completely broken for synch. Wunderlist actually worked. This is a disaster.,poor
"Doesn't allow you to sort completed tasks. I have a single grocery list with 300 tasks in it's completed section that's named by section using tags like ""Produce - onions"". I used to be able to sort completed tasks alphabetically making it easy to have a running list where I could add back frequently purchased items. Now everything is lost automatically placed in completed tasks by completion chronology. Is a pain.",poor
Forced to review to avoid popups every few days. Ok so far,poor
"When you create a task and then set a reminder, you have to go back to the text and press enter otherwise it doesn't save it, or even warn you if you navigate away. Caught me out a few times, seriously annoying so looking at other options. Other than that it's ok but nothing special and the views are a bit odd. All for example doesnt actually show all tasks!",poor
Why widget is not working....???!!!!!,poor
"Widget often becomes empty (after restarting of launcher, for instance). I have to open the app to make widget work. Note 10 + Apex launcher, Tab S6 + Samsung Home launcher.",poor
Impress me with something good that was not here during wunderlist. Thank you for screwing my wunder-lists and making me jump through the hoops of remembering skype password,poor
I m facing the i same issue which kenners79(below comment on 9/6/2020) is facing. Widget issue.,poor
This app used to be good when you could add widgets that would show each task you wanted to complete on the home screen. They have since removed that features and you can only add shortcuts to said custom lists. Might as well just use OneNote now. At lest that is used on my PC too.,poor
UI is good. Easy to use. The only thing that bother me is that the reminder didn't work. That's the basic and important feature of to do app. Missed many task because of this. Please fix it.,poor
App's widget still doesn't react correctly to dark mode changes. I can't see the list often!!,poor
Too complicated,poor
"The text on the notes always gets messy, specifically if you have spaces in between paragraphs or using links. Always gets messed up. Sentences move up and delete the first letters of the paragraphs. Really annoying.",poor
"This is based on Wunderlist, which Microsoft bought a few years ago. They added some nice touches and ate listening to users' suggestions, but it is still a work in progress. They removed too much of what made Wunderlist good. It integrates well with Outlook, though. For now, it's useless for anything but the simplest task management.",poor
"Very good application ... Only i facing issues is , it's won't work for offline .",poor
"In general, the app is confusing. Repeating tasks work for some time and then stop working. I have not found any clear logic behind this. The same problem was with wunderlist. Not recommended.",poor
"Used to be great, now it's awful. I use the Widget the most, and have it set to Important to see all my Tasks, not just 1 or 2 per day. Unfortunately, the widget reverts to 'My Day' every time I boot up my phone, and won't switch back. I have to remove the widget from my home screen, then re-add it & switch list to Important - every day! Today was the 5th day of doing this, and I got fed up, so switched to Google Tasks, which is now a much better app than it used to be, & better than To Do.",poor
"Needs a built in timer and some stats to make it the best productivity to-do out there.. for now it's just a generic to-do with folders. Hoping it gets an update with those features soon as I do love the design and other Microsoft products, for now I'm forced to use another to-do manager. :(",poor
"Widget never loads, making it nigh unusable in the way I used Wunderlist prior to the migration. All my lists are updated just fine in-app, but every item is just ""Loading..."" in the widget. Tried removing the widget and adding it again, tried stopping all services, tried re-installing, nothing works.",poor
The invite user feature is horrible. You can only do it through email as the text option doesn't work. I used to be able to select a user in the app and they would be notified in the app. I was a user of Wunderlist and this is a step backwards as far as I can tell.,poor
"Wunderlist was an excellent app, used to get my reminders on email. Now I don't get any reminders at all, hence don't see the use of this app. I have checked my phone settings and the app settings and the reminders are on but still no reminders either via app or email",poor
"Still cannot see tasks due today automatically on the widget or on the Live Tile. The overdue tasks are in red now, but still nothing on the ones due today. Who wants to take 10minutes every morning to put all tasks due today and mark them in My Day ? This could be done automatically with an opt-in button in the options, but still nothing.",poor
Can't use without a MS account. Improved sync. Widget doesn't allow you to chose which list you'd like to see without going into the app.,poor
Failed to arrange my tasks by dragging them as used to do with Wunderlist,poor
Why the comments section is not available yet? As I checked most of users needed it. We had it in wunderlist but here it is not possible to put a comment with recorded date in any list task.,poor
"It takes too long to update lists. My wife and I share lists, but it takes days, sometimes as long as a week, for changes to show up on each other's lists. The Wonderlist app updated almost immediately. We miss Wonderlist!",poor
"Application is very good, but the issue in synchronisation. Some times it wasn't sys and I have to sing out and sign in again. It's lose my modified list.",poor
"I understand that sometimes you need to replace product. But it beats me why they didnt keep wunderlist and just ditched idea of todo list? Maybe they dont want something that isnt tied to Microsoft? Anyway, app for now sucks, my shared lists from before dont work.. it was my main usage as it was so simple.",poor
"So so sad 😭 I LOVED Wunderlist. I used it to share lists with co workers, daily tasks and grocery lists. Now that it's linked to Microsoft I can no longer use without creating an email account with them:( I'm so bummed! It would be great if there was an option to use the app without creating an email account.",poor
"Had to retract my initial positive review as after longer use I started to spot issues, mainly notifications don't work at all. Even after whitelisting the app in battery management.",poor
Nice integration with Teams & Planner. Would get an extra star if I could assign tasks directly from To Do.,poor
"Sorry but the migration from Wunderlist made some things worse. The architecture stays the same and this is good but there are some things that are doubtful unfortunately. Why do I need to flag each task to make it appear on ""My Day"" ? If I assign a task for today, I want it to appear already in ""My Day"", otherwise what's the point of this ""My Day""? Not too many customization possibilities, the look of the app is a bit bulk and not so elegant. Some reminders are not working. I hope this can help",poor
I have finally given up with this Application. Although it works ok on its own not being part of Outlook (calendar & mail) on my Andoid phone is a drag. If I put a To Do into my calendar I like to also add it to my to do list but having to run this as a second stand alone app is far from ideal. On my Windows phone it was integrated into Outlook as it is on the PC. Why isn't it part of Outlook?,poor
"Assigning task is a problem and not available, the reminder is also wanting",poor
"Not much better than Wunderlist but now it's attached to my Microsoft account for work so I cannot share my personal lists, like the grocery list, with my family.",poor
"So, installed this on mac after been a wanderlust user, told me to create Microsoft account so I did. After a day it said session expired, logged back in everything had gone. So thought I'd give this a try, but cannot log in.",poor
"Пожелание разработчикам: Невозможно перемещать списки подзадач вверх и вниз в версии для Windows. Удерживаю левой кнопкой мыши, тяну и ничего не происходит. Сделайте специальные точки за которые можно тянуть по вертикали. Посмотрите как в Google Keep это реализовано и сделайте также. В мобильной версии у вас тоже удобно, а на ПК просто бесит. Неужели никто не жаловался на это?!",poor
Another shity microlimp product. They can't even copy a decent app.,poor
"Hi to Microsoft team, Request # 1: To be able to print a list with only the items marked with an asterisk which are classified in alphabetical order. Request # 2: For all tasks (from all lists) marked with an asterisk and which are all grouped in the same place, these tasks should be displayed in alphabetical order under their respective list (and not grouped in a single list ). And also, have different options to print a single or, all lists (with sorting options). Thank you",poor
"Looks good, imported fine from wunderlist, but will not sync with my desktop pc on windows 10. Huge disappointment and has affected productivity. Its in its early stages as an app so ill cut them a little slack, unfortunately my clients will not. Here is hoping it gets sorted.",poor
"No assistant from support in around one month, still no notifications unless app is open. Cannot be used for reminders. Phone has been reset in this time and app reinstalled , issue persists. Please confirm if this is by design?",poor
"MTD does not have the email reminder feature, most of the time my reminders don't show in the notification bar, they always did on Wunderlist, etc. Bring Wunderlist back, it's much simpler, more intuitive and has better features.",poor
Love the app as I am one of the migrated users from Wanderlist but have been a bit disappointed with the following after using To Do: 1. Option to change from Task list to pure check list. 2. Can't install the App on my PC although it is already on my Android phone.,poor
Widgets not working in latest update.,poor
"Unfortunately the app somehow does not actually give you reminders on the time and date you set them. Very disappointing. I had hoped this would be fixed moving from Wunderlist to this replacement. The problem seems to be that whenever you do not complete a task on the due date and leave it as is, the app will no longer remind you of anything. If all your tasks are in the future, it will remind you on that date although it might decide to do so later than planned. Weird ass bug needs a fix.",poor
Bring back Wunderlist. My list won't sync with people and I'm having issues.,poor
"As you mentioned, i checked my settings, sound has been enabled yet my reminders dont have sound",poor
"HATE the move of completrd to bottom. I have shopping list in the order the items are as I go round the supermarket, tick as I put in cart, untick as I need again. Used to still be in order when showing completed to untick. Now they are below and in scrambled order there. Should have made change an OPTION. I will have to look for a new To Do app. Very sad. BRING BACK ABILITY TO HAVE COMPLETED ITEMS SHOW IN ORIGINAL POSITIONS IN LIST AMONGST UNCOMPLICATED ITEMS.",poor
Widget does not allow you to input to specific lists. Makes for a hassle to open the whole app to add milk to my grocery list.,poor
The notification feature doesn't work for my phone. It's mi note8.,poor
"This app changed recently in an annoying way. Now, completed tasks are no longer sorted or even sort-able. We use this app for shopping lists and have previously appreciated the ability to sort a list we use repeatedly in alphabetical order. Now it's impossible to sort the completed taske for reuse. That's just lame.",poor
"I don't know if anyone else is experiencing this, but the app glitches CONSTANTLY with Chrome OS. Whenever I flip to ""My Day,"" the suggested tasks flicker on the screen and make using the app impossible. I used it on my Android phone and previously on my Macbook with no problem. I loved the ""My Day"" function and am loathe to switch to a different app, but I don't think I have a choice.",poor
"New update makes ""Planned"" inconvenient. I do like that you can group them now, a much desired thing from wunderlist. But I cant see overdue anymore. Can you please add overdue when viewing ""This Week"". It's inconvenient to flip between categories to see everything on one page.",poor
Where is calender?,poor
A lot worse UX than wunderlist,poor
"A fantastic and helpful app became useless with the last update. Grouping open and completed tasks may be helpful for some, but for some types of lists it would be really handy to have all tasks together. For example a picking list (or shopping list) with the items sorted in order of their position in the warehouse. You do not need everything every time, so you can just uncheck the items when needed during a round, possibly hiding the completed tasks to minimize screen cluttering. This was possible before, but with the recent update(s) all completed tasks have moved to a separate list. All custom sorting is lost. Dear Microsoft, please re enable these features. You could provide an option in settings to use one or the other. (Maybe even on a list level) 2 stars because it used to be a good app, otherwise I would have now given it only 1 star.",poor
All of my notifications from a day disappear if I clear one after midnight. What's the point of a to do list that won't allow notifications to persist?,poor
"A new ""feature"" of Microsoft To Do compared to Wunderlist is notifications being cleared at the start of every new day. This is incredibly annoying because if I don't have time to get to it, I want it to be a constant annoying reminder so I know to get around to it. I would rather continue to use Wunderlist, if the recurring tasks was implemented offline, instead of requiring the server to give you a recursive task.",poor
Please add a duedate on sub-step on a task.,poor
Need ability to sort completed tasks.,poor
At first I liked that I could choose to see or hide the done tasks and even the done tasks were on alphabetic order. I use this app also as a grocery list. So every time I want to add the done tasks I have to go throw everything. Why can't you have the done tasks in alphabetic order as well. Or that we could choose between this interface and the previous one ourselves. The way it is now (chaotic) it is very user unfriendly and time consuming.,poor
Migrating from Wunderlist but to be honest with zero integration with google calendar as Wunderlist had...this does not work for me. Off to todoist which has full integration. Really don't understand why you would close Wunderlist before having the same features in ToDo...,poor
"I have down graded my review because ""show completed & hide completed"" features have been removed. Also the ability to edit an item has also disappeared.",poor
"Everything is three colors: black, white, and bg color. Nothing feels separate or distinct, meaning I find it hard to visually separate individual tasks. To do lists should help me break down tasks not make them feel like a uniform lump. The star shouldn't be the same color as the background if it's supposed to stand out. Please make the star stand out more with a banner like Wunderlist and with a different color.",poor
REALLY miss Wunderlist. This just feels like a list of work I have to do rather than a list of possibilities from which to choose. To Do is a clunky PC type office app. Wunderlist was a fun life mobile app. I'll be looking for an alternative to To Do.,poor
It was great until the latest release broke most of the useful functionality,poor
"I switched over to Microsoft to do after being notified that Wunderlist would not be available. With the most recent update to the app, the 'planned' list now only shows a filtered view. And I have to group it by date to even see it for each day. Previously I could see everything at once -by due date even overdue items. I can appreciate that everyone might not want to see everything. There should be an 'all' option if you are going to limit this. Looks like I get to find a new app.",poor
Also forced to move from Wunderlist. Im missing the part on my widget where I could see today's tasks but also those for My Week and the overdue tasks as well. Please improve.,poor
Not as good or sleek as wunderlist. I miss wunderlist.,poor
"Please provide a way to sort completed tasks. When you want to uncheck them to add them back to the list, you have to hunt for the item. ugh...",poor
Man!!we cannot have an alarm type alert here...it brings a problem,poor
"Wunderlist migration/ Don't like Microsoft To Do. I really miss Wunderlist. I miss when I would save a link to Wunderlist and it would let me select the list I needed, not so in To-do. I'm trying to figure out how to leave To-Do for Trello or Todist. This is a bummer. Might just leave my stuff in To-Do and start all over again.",poor
"Actually wasn't a terrible replacement for Wunderlist until the last update. The one feature I used all the time was the ability to show completed items with un-completed and sort the whole list and then hide completed items again, leaving everything sorted. Now you can no longer merge the lists and sort. Why take something out that was actually useful? Now this app is virtually useless for me.",poor
برنامه خوبیه چون خیالت راحته تو گوشی ذخیره نمیشن. دسته بندیش خوبه ولی نقص داره هنوز. قابلیت بکاپ تو حافظه گوشی نداره. اگه حواست نباشه چیزی پاک کردی قابلیت برگشت نداره. و مقداری نسبت به نسخه کلاسیک مقداری دیر لود میشه.,neutral
Reminders sometimes don't work. Especially if set through browser on desktop or if we edit description after setting the reminder.,neutral

It's not as nice as wunderlist was.,neutral
"The widget constantly blanks out and I have to reopen the app to get my lists to show again. This is the only reminders app I've found to do this. Besides that, I really enjoy using this, but having nothing show on my homescreen widget is killing it for me.",neutral
The app is good and useful with great features it has everything that you need for a basic to do list app. but the reason for my 3 stars is that the widget is broken.,neutral
"It's extremely limited. There is no natural language processing. Even in English. You can't just type ""buy bread on Monday"" or ""call Max at 9"", which has been a basic features of this class of apps for years. There is only one level of sub-tasks. I wanted to switch to it from Todoist because I'm not a power user and would be happy with a basic app, but it lacks even the basics.",neutral
"For some reason, the widget tends to switch list at random. I'd like to see the option to set a default list in the widget as well as location based reminders.",neutral
"I love this app so far, it is simple to add notes. but reminder is missing every day because there is no option to add Alarm . Can you add this feature in next update .",neutral
"Good app , but needs lot of improvement",neutral
I really can't change notification sound and it uses the same phone notification.,neutral
I think that if it was linked to a calender it would be perfect,neutral
"I really like that I can set individual reminders for each task in the My Day screen. Whats annoying is when I set a quick task via the notification panel, I choose the date the task is for, say for 3 days time, but then when I choose reminder, it defaults to today instead of the date the task is set for. Edit: repeat weekday reminders are out of sync. Possibly by a day. Im getting them on a Saturday.and nothing on a Monday.",neutral
"Good simple add to track your task, I haven't explored the full features...",neutral
"This update has broken it, it's not giving me all my notifications of to-dos, and those it does, it doesn't mark them as done unless I open the app",neutral
"Microsoft has many applications available applications available are not advertised properly to all users. Would be amazing if Microsoft would have sales reps contact customers to see how customers are using their applications, customer software challenges and provide solutions for their customer using their applications. Maybe Microsoft will find 80 to 90% of customer issues could be resolved with the standard applications and provide customers upgrade solutions for their issues.",neutral

I hoped it have a timetable something,neutral
"Very good app for maintaining my tasks and important work. Need some improvements: 1. The reminder doesn't work properly and informs if the deadline is passed only after the app is opened. 2. There are issues with the updation of tasks from the pc application to the mobile application. Please fix these, otherwise the app deserves a 5 star rating.",neutral
"I want to use it but it requires a Microsoft account, it looks good though",neutral
Great app for managing your activities helped me alot but there is some issues Like The notifications doesn't always shows and reminds me that I have to do the task.,neutral

Please add an oled friendly dark colour scheme to the widgets,neutral
"Overall it is good. But I have several suggestions that will make it much better. Please contact me. I would pay to have a better app than a mediocre free one. And just so im clear, your updates seem to focus on sharing and connections. That is lipstick on a pig. Build the best app then worry about the connections.",neutral
It's good,neutral
It stops working in between times! Sometimes it stops reminding me about my tasks and sometimes it does. Please fix this,neutral
Please unify gui and workflow of planner and to do.,neutral
It serves the purpose but it's not exactly what I want in the way of organization.,neutral
Thank You :),neutral
Good,neutral
Please allow me to set due time also instead of just due date,neutral
It was working all good until the recent update. I use it on a split screen on a tablet. Previously the left hand side list bar was automatically hidden if the screen is small. Now it always stays which means the task list on the right is impossible to read.,neutral
Its very helpful,neutral
I like it but it started putting a note icon below each item I add to the list. It makes the item box twice as tall and it's super annoying.,neutral
It a decent basic app for what I need. My only current issue is that the height of each task box. Way too much white space on each individual task.,neutral
Can it show the schedule into calendar view?,neutral
So sad that Wunderlist must gone. Will this one expect the expectation? Why i can't open to do in web browser?!,neutral

Shame that when someone is creating a task there is no notification to the person this task is assigned to.,neutral
"This app is able to sync across your devices and has a simple user interface. Still, I'd like greater organization facilities than are currently available. I wish you could assign tags on items in different lists and then filter by tag. For example, I have a work list with my tasks in it and I'd like to assign tags corresponding to the work sub project the task belongs to.",neutral
Please fix the Android bug whereby every new item added gets a Note added too - very annoying!!!,neutral
Bug: some items without notes show in the list with the note icon underneath. On iOS the same list correctly doesn't show any note icon.,neutral
Microsoft has screwed up a really good app.,neutral
"For a little over a week, I've been experiencing a bug where every time I create a new to-do/item in a list, the little icon pops up indicating there's a note in the item, even though there never is. I've even tried adding and removing a note to see if it goes away, and it doesn't make any difference. Not a huge deal, but it takes up space on my screen and makes it harder to find list items that do actually have notes, so it's been fairly annoying.",neutral
"Tasks on outlook on my desktop are categorised which basically splits my 'to do' list in to sections (projects, next tasks, waiting for, etc) these categories do not pull through to this app so my list is just a mish mash of everything muddled together without the categorisation. This is a really key feature for me and i find it strange that categorisation of tasks doesnt exist on this dedicated app for managing tasks. Please promote this to the top of your backlog!",neutral
"I'm using the latest Android version of ToDo. Sometime in the last month or so any entry containing a URL ends up duplicating that URL many times. Deleting the duplicates within the entry works at first, but then the duplicates come back.

I have two problems: 1)If I am offline and application is closed then on my android 7.0 app do not works 2)I am unable to disable vibration(I do not founded in options menu). Please help,neutral
Decent. It would be good to add custom notifications,neutral
Previous versions had more fine grained options in the settings. They made the app really useful. I'd like them back.,neutral
App is good. Sticky notes would have make it more usefull,neutral
It's good once you figure it out,neutral
Latest gripe: Repeating tasks have started appearing on the prior calendar day rather than the proper repeating due day. But not always. Very weird.,neutral

"Todo is stylish and functional in all the ways is needs to be and beyond. connecting seamlessly throughout the app on pc mobile and online, i would love an integration for gmail or other such apps and perhaps a wear Os app but this is a great app for todo lists and reminders",good
Just using know. Exploring more.,good
Great app for all my To Do lists. There are just minor issues in syncing sometimes,good
"Crashes periodically, however I absolutely love the app! Does exactly what I wanted and is super simple to use. Not all the extra complicated and un-needed mumbo jumbo as some of the similar apps I have tried.",good
"I love the app so far. I really like how user friendly it is. But this app has a very limited selection of themes. Please offer more themes to choose from. Also, offering the ability to choose our own images from our computer or the internet for our task background would be great. Even though I chose not to use the Trello Task app, they have the above features I mentioned, and I loved having those options.",good
It's good but wish Google assistant would add to it,good
Great app. But if scheduled time more than 2 weeks it make it better.,good
It's alright.,good
Helpful app though some times doesn't update when someone else adds items. Bot not a frequent issue.,good
Simple to use and works great so far! Just wish that scheduled tasks could be shared with the calendar as an option.,good
Allow reminders to pop up. All in all it's ok,good
"I have a suggestion. In the ""All"" lists tab, please give the option of sorting the tasks within the different categories they've been created. I need both the categorisation of tasks into different groups and the ability to arrange them within those categories, say by Due Date or Alphabetically!",good
Still to work out the kinks,good
Nice app but complicated setting are there at some points but this is best app 🙂👍👍👍👍👍 I ever used in to do works,good
Simple to use,good
Nice for productivity,good
Easy to use,good
"Very simple, easy to use. Would like to see it developed just a little more to include more choices of background images, or ability to add custom background images.",good
Very useful app.,good
Nada mal.,good
"Easy to use but needs some features. We mostly use it for a communal shopping list. It would be nice if you could assign categories to items such as frozen, produce... it works great for a to do list either shared or personal.",good
"Thanks, just started & looks great Cheers",good
"Great app, would be nice if it synced with calenders better...",good
Easy to Use!,good
This is not reminding me even though I set an remainder option,good
I use a daily for tasks and lists. There could be one more subcategory/sublist. It would be nice to show pictures in line too.,good
Well structured,good
Great.,good
It's a nice but I personally need a full screen pop up. It's convenient for me personally.,good
Item duplicate automatically,good
"Wish we could attach images and use tags for work/personal/chores, school, etc. Excellent app regardless. Love it",good
Slow to open. Needs an option to list in order of oldest task first. Great overall.,good
Great app,good
"great app, loving the interaction with O365",good
A search function in completed items would increase the stars to 5!,good
"On online anywhere can review the task, category wise task status is the key to review the pending task.",good
"The interface is not very intuitive but does more than a satisfactory job once you get used to it. I'd like to see a more colourful home page and more theme options and the option to connect to Google Calendar, clock, Microsoft Your Phone, etc. Overall solid app for daily use",good
Great for getting tasks from phone to PC. Not so good at understanding long lists on phone,good
Very good app,good
Nice app,good
"Simple to use, nice clean look, keep personal and business tasks separate.",good
"One flaw, the app doubles every url put into a note field. This becomes an issue when you re-edit the note and the duplicates then get reduplicated.",good
"Great app, helps me a lot, but kinda annoys me that when I set a reminder to repeat every day it doesn't remind me every day and I have to set it manually.... Anyways still one of the best apps for managing you time and increasing productivity. TRY IT FOR A WEEK - YOU WON'T REGRET IT",good
it would be great if we could have geographic reminders like when you drive home and it will remind you,good
Convenient,good
Great,good
Microsoft is great at listening to reviews. I still miss Wunderlist but To Do is close.,good
6. Xz,good
"Excellent design for To Do lists and easy to use, but I haven't been able to figure it how to fully sync and integrate with my laptop MS Office 365 version, so 4-stars instead of 5. But otherwise stellar.",good
Keeps me organized,good
Excellent app for sharing tasks across family members. Would give it more stars if it worked as the task app for Outlook,good
"Very useful, awaiting further updates as have been announced by Microsoft with synchronization with Teams",good
Very good for managing tasks and very efficient in collaborating with others,good
Great organizational tool. I use it every day.,good
"Used to take the place of Wunderlist. Actually liking it much better. It would be helpful to see who created the task, who edited it and when. Also being able to add comments others would notice was an addition, or ask questions on it that would alert the creator there was a comment/question, would be super helpful. Other than that, very satisfied.",good
Works well with Office products,good
"Like it a lot, very useful with shared lists. Would also be nice to have the option to be able to schedule tasks on a calendar for cross-reference.",good
Great app! Thank you Microsoft.,good
Fine app Would be better if we could sync it with other apps as well.,good
"I love the minimalist style of the app. Nothing crops up to clog space until you need it. And once you need something, then it's intuitively handy. Thanks guys.",good
"There is something wrong with the world. Look at all these reviews. People give it 1 star rating . Thats ok. But they complain about the app like they own it. Developers give you the app to use for FREE. Instead of being rude or mad, you could just give a polite feedback so that they can improve. Or just use some other app. Remember. You dont own it.",good
"Not the old Palm app, but still usefu l.",good
Simple and Neat. Wish it could let me add priority on tasks and allow me to reorder the tasks within Planned tab.,good
Good,good
Needs more work. Notes are awkward; maybe what I want is something simpler.,good
I think the app with a time table for sorting tasks will become more useful .,good
Awesome and Esay to use.,good
Good app that syncs with Outlook. Widget needs transparent options.,good
"""My day"" is a great feature. But perhaps it will help to be able to plan it atleast the previous evening.",good
They should give some type of sound feedback when u finish a task,good
"4 stars because ""location based reminders"" is missing. Best Task management app in 2020.",good
Very good,good
Please add time stamps and ranking to sub tasks in each task.,good
This app is so good but can be better on remainder,good
I like this app.,good
Excellent...👍 App But Please.. Add Recycle-Bin in the app,good
Very Good,good
Very nice app. Using it regularly to get reminders.,good
"Works very well across all my devices, information and attachments,",good
It is a real time management tool.,good
"Very easy to use and share with your family. You can create groups and asign tasks. I don't add the last start because it is easy to click done and I use it at the market. Then something can be changed to ""done"" and you forget to buy...",good
The worst thing is it's not integrated with one drive to attach or edit file.,good
Good,good
I would like a more in depth prioritization system beyond a star. Thinking the quadrants from the #7habits of highly effective people.,good
Shopping grocery lists-/apointments-/on all devices to update and edit when you think of it,good
Good Application,good
"Really useful, it helps me organize and keep track of my daily tasks. I use To Do on both windows and android. My only problem is when it sync the changes on desktop , the widget on my phone doesn't change at all until I open the app. A refresh button on the widget would do, or make it sync like google keep.",good
Great to do list. Waiting for new features. Eg notes should have a comment section with Timestamp,good
Useful with good UI,good
Very good app and easy to use.,good
"Me gusta, apenas la estoy implementando en mi día a día",good
Great App but need to add mark complete check.,good
"It is simple to use, just started to use",good
Nice,good
Very good app for day to day planning,good
"It's nice and simple, good for productivity.",good
"Pretty good, not quite as clear and quick as wunderlist but 90% as good.",good
Please add option to sort by reminder time,good
"Pretty good app. Would get 5 stars if: 1. It had ""Delete all checked items"", and 2. The reminder used the Android alert system.",good
Helps to become more productive. Not using AI or recommendation engines.,good
Good,good
"This app is actually more functional than Wunderlist, the app it devoured. And that is really atypical for Microsoft's developers.",good
i would like to set a background from pictures from my gallery not from the ones you gave me,good
Very useful,good
Need custom notification tone.,good
"Ite very good app , but I felt Microsoft apps consume more battery and little bit slow to open the pages , and there is no offline access, pls update this to all apps thank you.",good
"Overall has been good with helping me ger on top of things and organising myself. But, the reason I have had to leave a review today is because I have noticed when I paste a link into the description of a task, it copies and pastes the link in twice. Please sort out the glitch. Hence why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5.",good
"Please add a feature to assign tasks to multiple users. And for no reason, the app ads an empty note to every new task being created with the Android app.",good
Syncs nicely between 2 users,good
"Easy to use, exactly what I needed",good
"Fab list app, be even better if you could sort steps of a task, so incomplete steps are listed first. Thanks!",good
"Awesome App, 1) if you could add undo feature : if we make any changes to the todo unexpectedly and press back then it saves it and we cannot find what was the original memo.",good
Good,good
Enjoying it thus far,good
"All in all, working nicely. I wish that it would be possible to add people to lists without the need to send them the link (as it was possible in Wunderlist).",good
Doesnt show you task in outlook calendar Planned task aren't shown in My day when they are actual,good
"Good app to remember work to do, it could be more better if important point flashes time to time.",good
Very good application trustable from Microsoft.,good
Simple and easy to use. Syncs on phone and pc which is very useful,good
"Would like to see an option for ""delete all completed tasks"", instead of having to select one at a time.",good
"Really good app and I like ""My Day"" function, but still has lots things need to improve, e.g. Batch Insert function, it already could sync with outlook task but without subtask, that a shame. I believe that this app could be very powerful if it could work with outlook and OneNote. Also, its time to concern supported Wear OS.",good
"not flawless, but works, motivating.",good
از حیث ابعاد مختلفی کامله، مثل امکان گروه بندی، امکان آپلود فایل، امکان ساخت «ساب تسک»، تنظیم سر رسید، تنظیم یادآور، امکان شیر وعهده‌گذاری کار‌ها به علاوه محیط بسیار کاربر پسند. تنها مشکل اینه برای «ساب‌تسک‌ها» نمی‌توان تاریخ سر رسید و عهده‌گذاری داشت، و میزان و نحوه روند انجام کار امکان نمایش ندارد. * برای دوستان لازم می‌دونم بگم بین محیط ویندوز و اندروید به خوبی همگام سازی میشه و همچنین هر تقویمی که دستگاه روش نصب باشه رو نمایش می‌ده.(یعنی برای ویندوز ۱۰ تقیم کامل جلالی),good
Very good use app,good
Would be more effective if there was an option to add reminders for subtasks and option to add time deadline along with due date.,good
"Love the app. Especially the sound it gives off when you tick off a task. Only thing is that you can't thoroughly organise the tasks you have set. Other than that, I highly recommend.",good
"Feature Request 1. Add transparent background option in widgets, like after completing each task the size of the widget becoming small though actual size of the widget is large. 2. Provide option to view tasks pending for the week in widget",good
"Nice app but please add some alarm features in it , something we might not hear the notification call.",good
I like the app. Easy to use and organize. I just wished there was a way to turn the spell check off in it. It's miserable trying to type non-European style names in it.,good
Amazing app I am very happy to follow my tasks jobs etc.amazing app.but I want the developers to keep an option which will continue everyday the same tasks it would be nice I have to always write my tasks daily,good
"It fails to sync between devices, which is highly desirable. However its integration with MCalendar and MMail App is very useful.",good
"Great, does the basics I need it to. Tricky to move tasks to folders?",good
"It would be awesome if shared task reminders would sync, right now only due dates sync.",good
"I think what this app needs most, is some project management and task tracking abilities to see how much of task has been done. Task shouldn't remain in the dichotomy of to do and done!",good
It's very useful for the All,good
Love it! Helps me to stay organized so mych more. Love the detailed features as well!,good
If have difference label or Icon can be used then is better,good
"Very useful, simple & easy to use",good
Ok,good
"This app is simple and easy to use. After a year of trying other to do apps, I have loaded this onto my phone and laptop. The app works great and synchs great as well. New graphics are awesome. One detail that needs to be addresses: deletion of completed tasks is very cumbersome!",good
"Functionally good, would be nice to have more personalisation options e.g. custom backgrounds etc",good
Very useful. Would like tasks dated today to appear automatically in My Day.,good
"Excellent. Some unique features that make this my go to android task app. Although, some other features either don't exist or are hard to find. In future updates the following additions would be handy: - Create and sync tasks using OneNote App (currently desktop only) - Assign Calendar Event (currently desktop only) - have an option to plan tomorrows ""My Day"" or even roll over incomplete tasks from today to tomorrow.",good
Very useful app 👍,good
App keeps asking for access to other apps we high i do not want to permit.,good
The app is near perfect. It has just one flaw for me: adding pictures or files or other attachments. Why do I need to be online to add files to a reminder? Please make attaching files available offline to add an extra layer of convenience.,good
Very useful,good
"Really Helpful, Simple and Feature Rich",good
its nice,good
Great,good
It's easy to use and perfect for all my lists!,good
Top Notch. Easy to use and manage tasks or projects. The reminders don't send full notifications quite often so a little bug to work on there.,good
"You can now be signed in with both a work or school account and a personal account in this app, meaning that we now have all of desktop Outlook's functions in a first party app. Still not sure why this is not built into mobile Outlook. And you can't display both accounts on the same widget.",good
Fairly easy to use. Very useful for shopping lists and to do lists,good
It's overall very nice but small things keep frustrating me. One particular thing is Why can't you add reminders for custom days? Why pick a specific day?,good
"Sir good app but pls add some features to this app ,it will make more interesting",good
"Works as described, but not very intuitive. There's plenty of choices for storing and organizing tasks and I'm still trying to decide which options work best for me.",good
"There seems to be a bug with the latest version where all new items have the note icon showing. Please fix, it's annoying.",good
So far from my user experience(switch from any do)Already good & keeps getting better every update thank microsoft team,good
"Fairly good looking app. If you cancel notification it doesn't remind you that the team hasn't completed. Would like a more, ""naggy"" for individual tasks.",good
Great app Simultaneously connects to desktop.,good
"One of the better to-do lists out right meow. Very simple and straightforward. The only problem I have is, I'd like to see is an option for a daily recurring task to be automatically added to My Day without having to go into the task and physically doing it every day. Then, I will rate it 5 stars.",good
Add. Memo with overlapping facilities of diff. Memos.,good
"Simply the best productivity app out there. It fully integrates with Outlook, Planner, etc. It's very customizable and easy to use. It used to be able to integrate with Cortana's reminders, but unfortunately, since Cortana's fate is still nebulous, this feature is not what it used to be. So it's lacking support for some digital personal assistant reminders. That's the only reason it's not 5 Stars for me.",good
Amazing,good
It would be nice if you could color code tasks. Otherwise a very good app.,good
Es muy completo para lo que necesito,good
Easy to use . One additional feature you can add is to provide an option in themes where we can set some inspiring quotes from our gallery.,good
Great application. However application is a bit not responsive.,good
Perfekt vor Produktliste. Schwer mit Ordner umgehen,good
"I love the design and everything about it! Definitely recommend it! Just one problem, there isn't a calendar that can be displayed to see your tasks. Please add that! Thank you!",good
This helps so much getting things done. It's so satisfying to make stuff off the list. 5 stars can't live without,good
"Making my life better, it is good to have a todo list !",good
Nice,good
"The ""search"" feature is much faster than the last app I was using. I feel empowered 👍",good
Would appreciate a more attractive alarm with reminders,good
Runs Good,good
Satisy all of my needs,good
"Useful, easy to use. Beautiful design. Sync between PC and mobile device.",good
Good,good
A grate app i use it every day,good
It's very easy to use. This app has made my life so much more organized!,good
This app is so helpful in my day to day life!,good
Thank u for making this app fire five stars to it😜😜🤯,good
Simple to use.,good
Bery guud hahayes!,good
A1,good
Best app,good
Nice app. Improved to do version.,good
I find it very helpful to keep track of my day and keeps me on task.,good
Ok,good
Excellent very helpful a good way to share tasks with somebody we use it to buy groceries for example when we're in Costco one person can find one thing and the other person can find another thing and you check it off and you know it's been found that makes it very fantastic!,good
Система Дорофеев отлично ложится в этот инструмент. Рекомендую!,good
"O aplicativo é muito bom porém algumas coisas precisam ser melhoradas. Primeiro, deveria ter um opção que você gravasse uma mensagem de voz registrando a tarefa por via de áudio. Segundo, deveria ter uma opção de tarefa não cumprida, um ""x vermelho"" que indica que a tarefa não foi cumprida, porque quando eu registro uma tarefa para ser feita diariamente e algum dia eu não a cumpra, não tem a opção de registrá-la como não feita e enquanto eu não colocá-la como feita o app não põe no dia seguinte.",good
Excellent,good
"So far, really liking it!",good
Nic,good
Better than google task,good
So far so good...all wonderfully arranged according to my way and my headings...easy to use I only realized now that it shows under a different name with my number...how do I edit this?,good
🥰🥰🥰🥰,good
Very good performance 😊,good
Helpful for my daily activities notes. Thanks a lot.,good
Excellent App! Keeps me organized.,good
This app helps me to be more organised.,good
Great!,good
Customizable and syncs nice across all our devices.,good
Very user frendly and easy to communicate in corporate gruops,good
Disks,good
Awesome application thankyou microsoft,good
Best to do app ever,good
Highly recommended for any one trying to overcome procrastination,good
Wonderful!,good
I love this app,good
Simpan and easy,good
Great,good
Very useful to quickly make a list or have a long one for like a grocery list right on your phone.,good
Best app... pls add function of multiple intraday alarms for any task.,good
Im enjoying the structure of this app.,good
Great app...Unless your spouse controls it. 😁,good
Works,good
Agregar una opción para poner una nota general en una lista de tareas.,good
Just what I needed,good
Wonderful app.,good
"I use it as the grocery list for when I shop. Everybody in my family used to wait until I was busy doing something else to tell me about what they needed from the store and they would assume that since ""they told me"" that I heard them or retained the information which made for a lot of disappointments. So I shared the app with the family so everybody can add to the list as needed for themselves. As far as my family is concerned, it's a life saver (for them 🙂).",good
Best reminder and organizer app,good
Easy to use and does what it says.,good
Simple and useful 👍,good
Good and easy to use,good
Super,good
Multi functional app for daily tasks routine,good
👍🏻🙏🏻👍🏻EXCELLENT AND FREQUENT UPDATES! PLEASE IMPROVE NOTIFICATIONS FOR QUERIES & COMMENTS!!! 🤩😇🤩😇,good
Does everything.,good
That's awesome 🤩💓 easy and fast,good
"Awesome app,thank u microsoft",good
Love it 😊,good
Almost as good as wunderlist,good
Finally!!! After looking for several months I found the perfect to-do app that is ****not annoying. Thanks Microsoft,good
Ajterth,good
Good,good
It's amazing I really like it it's so easy and you can use it anytime and it's encourage you to do your work faster and it's so good 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍,good
Good task reminder app. Very intergration with 0365,good
Excellent app for setting up ur daily routine.,good
Great app,good
"For me, the best app for organizing your life. But some things should be improved though: 1. You can't set Monday as the first day of the week. 2. Having some of your notes appear both in Planned and Tasks and some in Planned but not in Tasks is bewildering. Besides Planned and Tasks there are two more lists - My Day and Important. Why so many overlapping lists? 3. You can't change fixed time for reminder alarm. For example, ""tomorrow"" is always at 9 a.m. You can't change that to, say, 10 a.m. 4. You can't set quick alarm. For example you can't type some note and then tap ""remind me in half an hour"" or in 15 minutes, in two hours etc. There's no such option. 5. You can't insert a photo or voice recording into your reminders. 6. You can't protect your reminders and notes with a password. Anyone can read them.",good
I love it!,good
Excellent app.,good
Works well for me. Several lists.,good
A good app,good
It helps me remember things.,good
Love that my husband and I can share our lists!,good
Beautiful layout and well developed,good
Very good,good
Awesome and multi device sharing.,good
Easy to keep yourself organised and prioritise your todos,good
Absolutely astonishing!,good
Love this app and office 365 in general,good
The new update brings a lot that was desired. Most importantly list sharing with much better approach than wunderlist. But task assigning within the shared list and chat on a particular task is still missing and this is something that still holds me back from fully migrating from Wunderlist.,good
Best of the best,good
Very nice app must try,good
Awesome,good
"Myself and my husband find this very useful for things we have to do, home repair, groceries, holiday lists.",good
The best thing to type and remember our list,good
Application is much nice but windows application having much synchronization issues. It would be big improvement if it gets sync across all devices specially windows application.,good
Free,good
Better than other app,good
"I've used Microsoft To-Do list for a while now and really enjoyed the seamless experience of having everything sync across. I love how simple it is to add new items and create new lists. The colour, design and layout is perfectly straightforward, having no clutter. Any actions added sync immediately to other devices using Microsoft To-Do list. I just wish actions added to MyDay list would save to each specific day like on a calendar so I can revisit those events.",good
Easy to use and very helpful,good
This added significantly to my recent productivity hights.,good
Nice app.,good
Love it,good
Great app Easiest and most customisable app in playstore,good
Splendid life-work organizing method,good
I'm a student and this app helps me a lot,good
Great app to organise your tasks,good
"Just what I was looking for, this works for me.",good
The preview video sold me after 30s. Didn't even watch the last 15s.,good
Love it!,good
Thank you devs for an amazing app! All in one without the unnecessary waste the others provide for a fee. Strongly recommend anyone reading for download confirmation. Don't forget to cancel your subscription to the other waste of money/space.,good
"Very good app. I tried other apps before, some were simple and some were sophisticated. This one mixed the simplicity and competence.",good
"Great for keeping updated with work tasks, administration or groceries",good
"Error: Can't add a step after other with an enter, you ought to go to bottom. // Lacks: Can't search your tasks or, steps, with an option ""search"" into lists or steps sections.",good
Amazing! Superb!,good
Extremely good for work,good
Love the fact it updates all 3 of my devices,good
Perfect,good
"Simple, but effective",good
I absolutely love it love it love it this is a good Microsoft to-do list and you can take it anywhere on the phone now and Markoff anything I love it hope it doesn't change its taste just as good as it is now,good
"A 5 star because it's the best ToDo app I've tried...and I've tried a lot. Well thought out and well integrated with Office although it works great as a standalone app. I use it for multiple businesses, projects, personal etc.",good
"Excellent app. I use it for groceries lists, work to-do lists, camping lists, saving documents etc etc... fantastic and easy to use...",good
Very useful app.,good
Very good tool for day to day use,good
It will only alarm if you will open the app,good
"The best to do app on the market. Very easy to use, very intuitive and logical interface.",good
Feels very intuitive. The steps feature is awesome. I wish that the other tasks can be merged to another task to form as another step. It would be great to group and order random ideas without needing to look for other related tasks. But my love for this app is there. xx,good
"I love this app!! My family can add things to grocery list from there phones as we run out! Also, great for when I am in the store as well. We can also monitor when chores are being done!",good
Simply superb!!,good
Best app for planing and to do.. ;],good
Most useful to do list there is. Wish had more time features so i can short tasks by their deadlines (what hour they finish),good
Excellent,good
It is excellent for your Info updated.,good

"Love this app, would definitely recommend to someone looking for an everyday To do list app, you can even share with family members!",good
Nice app for reminder.,good
Excellent product really helps me keep track of my daily simple tasks without having to use OneNote for much bigger efforts. My particular like the auto sync between phone and laptop via cloud,good
"Handy, colorfull, easy to use, good integration with PC, user freindly ...",good
easy and good interface,good
Still trying out but great so far. Integrates great with office 365 outlook and planner.,good
By far the best to do list / task management app. Syncs perfectly with the desktop app as well.,good
Keeps me organized! Great app :),good
Best list app I have used. It's excellent.,good
"Just use it for lists, works well",good

"Loved it so far! Simple, intuitive, just does the work.",good
Works well,good

it is to use. Keeps me from forgetting my tasks,good
Great app,good
Does not support more than only one Outlook calendar. Moreover won't work with I365 calls {inet connection failure} while just added calendar,poor
Are there any plans to develop a corresponding watchface in the Samsung app store for Samsung watch devices? UPDATE: ...when? ?,poor

Dont use this app for real!!!,poor
Calander doesn't sync properly even if you add event adds it to different days,poor
"My calendar events not showing in widget , maybe it doesn't support my phone, this is why I am uninstalling it",poor
"Sorry, maybe I was a little too harsh. Anyway, this app is kind of confusing for me. Using it is not comfortable for me.",poor
"Not easy to operate and not good interface, uninstalled already, was expecting much better",poor
Doesn't work properly .,poor

It's not working properly now. The sync was very slow. Overall very bad experience.,poor
Confusing as hell.,poor

How to change celceus to farenheight?,poor
Bekar,poor
Was good. But no longer updating real time...,poor
Not so good at all. How to enter stuff and completely useless. Very bad 👎 😕,poor
I can't copy past the activities for other days i must write them on every day on the calendar,poor
"Seems like a good idea, but doesn't actually do anything but waste more time. Completely useless. Can't find calendar events. Each event has to be re-entered manually. Why would anyone want an app that is just MORE WORK? STUPID! HUGE waste of time!",poor
Widget doesn't work,poor
One feature add your app reminder with music tone,poor
"Sounds like a wonderful idea for time management, but it won't show half of the things on my calendar and kind of ruins the entire purpose.",poor
Couldn't figure out why there was a gray line in addition to the red line showing the hour. Also all day events show as a small sector instead of the entire circle. Looking at a regular calendar is still easier.,poor
someone created a time productivity app that takes too much time out of your day to understand it.,poor
Scam!! Got my google Calendar scammed!! Please don't install,poor
helps me somehow,poor
Why is it being linked with my google calendar or phone calendar? I don't want this private app to access my Google calenders and phone calender. Instead you should have just added the feature of adding tasks within the app. I'm deleting this. The UI is great. But I don't want you to link with my private apps.,poor
It cannot work by itself and it's not user-friendly,poor
Does not pick up the calender events despite setting them,poor
Does not detect my device's calendar (device default app) but instead asks me to download a calendar.,poor
"Need to about to change the Events colors thank you, other setting has the color plate to select, why is the Events that controlling the whloe widget background but only having 16 colors? And it doesn't shows the color that I chosen... they are not the same color, the magenta shows up light purple... not matching with my phone setting... and my widgets, and I hope there has a setting that can one click and the whole app color hue would be the color I like or choose, I don't like blue.",poor
"Previously good, currently bad. This app takes you straight to Google calendarfor creating an event but once the event has been set, it's on calendar only. It doesn't even show that any event has been set on the app itself. I was using this app as sort of a time table but if I'm not able to see my plans for the day, then what's the use. Pls fix it",poor
Bad,poor
I bought tgis application once in my infinex and when i turn to my samsong i download it and he said buy it once and for ever ... What is going on people,poor
I don't know why this app is hard to understand . I have seen many positive comments and that's why i installed it but this is complicated or may be I want something else which this app doesn't offer.,poor
Hard to control make this app easy to control. It's eating my head.,poor
I don't really liked it much . Waste of intenet.,poor
Not working,poor
"I unistalled just for the costumer service. I was ready and willing to give the app a shot. But given the cruel, uncaring, and sarcastic responses to others who were unpleased with how the app works I will be uninstalling imediately.",poor
google calander doesnt synchronise.,poor
This is a waste app. After few days it started to shiw nothing and it says it takes time to sync with the calender but still after 24 hrs they dont sync. Please dont install this app and then expect to be productive.,poor
Is there a way to add events directly . I don't want to sync it with calendar.It is very time consuming.,poor
Doesn't sync with calendar.,poor
The settings don't work well and it's really confusing when it doesn't function at all!!!! 😤,poor
Very complex....,poor
"rly love the design, but way too scattered. (for me)",poor
Might be a good app but complicated to use,poor
Not the best. Did nor enjoy.,poor
include monthly to do list. which helps students to create timetable.,poor
I'm sure this would be a great app... if you could actually use it. But it only allows you do add things from another calendar making it useless if you don't have one.,poor
Cannot use without existing calendar,poor
Not what I thought it was... This only blocks out time for your calendars. I was looking for something that would help with daily routines. 😕. I even tried to use the calendar before giving up... But it refused to sync. So it's useless,poor
There should be add different time schedule in app not be in mobile colander,poor
Really frustating configuration...,poor
"Too complicated. It probably has a lot of, but it's not intuitive enough.",poor
In this app it is very hard to use,poor
"Doesnt work on ALL android Wear OS devices. Specifically, doesnt work with the Watch Active2.",poor
No es intuitiva,poor
Puts all info in default Google calendar.,poor
"How it SHOULD work is fantastic and perfect for me. But whenever I have my schedule laid out and planned, the app deletes them or forgets them and i have to start over, only to have them deleted again. I really really want to use it. Why does it make it so unable to?",poor
"dependant on another calendar app. Why? why do I need to have another app to use this app? I can't add plans or schedule without this app throwing the task to Google Calendar. Besides, I don't use G.C anymore since I once missed an event which I put a reminder through the G.C app because it never reminded me. I read one comment for this app that it never gave a reminder for a scheduled task and yes I have an idea why it happened.",poor
"Uninstalled...Not at all what I thought it was. This entire app is basically just a fancy way to look at the calendars you already have. Everything syncs both ways, so if you add your actually daily schedule minute by minute to this app you are also cluttering up your calendar(s) with the same things. Would've been neat if it actually had some kind of function, but I don't need to waste sd card space on a calendar viewing app.",poor
Not sync with Google Calendar,poor
This is Demo Only,poor
"I like this app. It's just that whenever I enter something in my calendar, it would not sink right away.",poor
"I wanted to like it, iinitially it looked great but it has such a limited window of time view it's no good for planning. A few hours view and that's it. Scrolling hour by hour day by day? Useless. Its sole function appears to be to tell you what you've got coming up in the next few hours which frankly is not much use to anyone as far as I can see. Cloud Cal uses similar circles with a view of the whole month which would be great but sadly the pro version doesn't work so no go there either.",poor
Uninstalled as calendar events keep appearing under the wrong date. Disappointing.,poor
"cool visual but doesn't work the way I thought it would. I don't like organizing my hour-by-hour tasks through my calendar because it clutters it up and makes me miss my important events. I wanted to use this app thinking that it would allow me to plan my dialy tasks just through the app. But every time I want to plan an event it forces me to do it through my calendar which I don't like. good concept, but I don't see a reason to use it since it just wants me to use my calendar anyway.",poor
"Used to love it, but the latest version broke it. Couldn't get it to work. All widget face buttons would work for a few seconds then break. Tried all settings, didn't work. Fix it and I'll reconsider my rating.",poor
Clicking on the widget doesn't open the app anymore :( :(,poor
"Good on paper, tried it out and off the bat wouldn't sync any news items, wish it had an option to at least input items directly. Either way didnt work",poor
Lnot friendly interface,poor
It gives the option to add a local calendar but doesn't let you use it unless you also give permission to use a Google or Outlook calendar. Kind of defeats the purpose of doing a local-only calendar if I can't actually use it.,poor
"does not work properly , does not update wit hcalendar entries , worst thing , cannot aak my money back!!!!!!!",poor
"It has a lot of functionality bugs. Some of my events were not adding, after restaring the app, other events just disappeared etc. I m really sorry i had to delete it because it looked nice and could be very useful but it s not working. Thanks!",poor
Language of the app doesn't change at all places,poor
Its really hard to shedule,poor
Not felt user friendly,poor
V.V.V.V.BAD,poor
Instalei de novo e não mudou muito minha ideia. Quero um calendário e não uma ferramenta pra integração com o calendário do Google. tá de sacanagem,poor
Inaccurate - always says activity overlaps with another activity when it doesn't.,poor
"Nothing work, I have my calendar prepared for months, and nothing come inside the Sectograph, Even I added new one, nothing appeared",poor
Want to customize colors buy the pro version. Not a chance. Thanks for nothing b,poor
24 hour mode is a PRO feature?!,poor
Bought the Paid version. The app fails to get data from anything except Gmail. Good concept but lacks in across provider connectivity.,poor
I can't synchronized to my calendar.,poor
"Dude. Don't we all want people to pay us for everything we come up with. XXXXXXX Hi! Thanks for the attentive reply. Though this app was not worth the payment or storage space for me, I did find one that works nicely. Looking forward to more replies, hopefully relevant, or none at all.",poor
"Purchased the full version which did nothing. Opted for a 24 hour face, again nothing. Tried to add additional events in upcoming days, did not show up at all.",poor
"After installing the app, i check to see if my reacurring event would show up. And it did that one time. So minutes after i insalled i had to let it go.",poor
"Most of My Google calendar events doesn't appear in the sectograph app. If i try to delete some events which is appeared, it cannot remove in the app also. I prefer if the app has own calendar so that events that ill creat might able show easier.",poor
приложение путает am и pm,poor
Only certain Google calendar entries show in the sectograph making this absolutely pointless. A great idea that is flawed in execution.,poor
wew,poor
Alarm nahi he,poor
It's not working :((,poor
Deleted app due to not putting things in I was looking forward to using this app I am getting the same issues as sharlyn,poor
"The idea is great, however it adds only event to my calendar. I like circle planer idea and that I simply can put work and then event at work and that it reflects on this circle. This has potential but make it simple and functional. I was used to test some apps and for me this was not functional and easy going. Make it that 7 years old kid can use it.",poor
"It's not working unfortunately. At first it was reflecting then when I added more items, it's no longer working. It just keeps adding the data in the calendar but no graph is being created",poor
I just bought pro on my tablet 15 minutes ago and then installed Sectograph on my phone and it says I have to buy pro again. What the heck happened with syncing google accounts,poor
it wouldnt sync to my Google calendar I had it set up and everything,poor
"Very nice app. Could be very useful, but unfortunately does not sync. :(",poor
Great idea but doesn't show all events for the day; doesn't show events in designated colours (all look the same); doesn't show repeat events! No use really. I'm removing it from my phone.,poor
this is very good,poor
Difficult to understand. Bit complicated,poor
No Outlook Calendar support. Most business people use Outlook...,poor
"Not a stand alone app. Must use calendar on mobile, my pout was to use it on its own.",poor
just an unwanted extension of calendar,poor
no use,poor
"There is no time setting in this graph only dates, that's while.......",poor
"This program does not work, PERIOD! Installed. Opened. Just sits there at the start screen, frozen and does nothing. No available controls or menu. Nothing. Do not use it. There is nothing to use.",poor
Poor interface.,poor
not good,poor
hard to use. if we could make some changes just by sliding the clock or smthn that would be awesome,poor
foolish app. steals data. doesn't have anything of itself. takes everything from Google calendar,poor
"What appealed to me the most about this app was the promise that we get to see the clock on your home screen. However the settings doesn't offer that option... Now it's just another app callendar you have to tap to see what's coming up... I liked the idea I could just turn on my phone and bang! the clock would just simply show me my schedule... Idk if it's a bug or just a false promise, either way it's disappointing.",poor
"Great Concept but executed poorly. I added 2 events between 6.30am and 9.30 but when I tried adding one for 10.30am it would let me, saying it overlapped with another event which it did not. I even checked my calendar and nothing was there for that time. It's now 11.42am, I tried adding an event for 3.30pm and it said its saved but hasn't showed on the clock or anything so it's pretty useless at this point.",poor
Doesn't Sync Anymore! & I Paid For The Pro Version... 😤,poor
didn't like it.. it's connected to the calinder..,poor
too useless,poor
"Poor settings options. I tried to set a schedule for an entire day to be more productive. Kept getting emails for each task at the time I scheduled it. I also got notification pop-ups on my MacBook calendar app which seemed to sync itself with my Google calendar. I went to Google calendar to turn it off but it wouldn't let me. I had to delete all 10 emails, hide the notifications and now I will be uninstall this app. It should have an option to disable syncing. Nice idea. Lazy developers.",poor
no instructions..,poor
Should have an option to add reminders. it only displays events,poor
"I wanted to like this app. It's a very convenient way to see all the info I need right on the screen, but when I click on the task button I get trapped on the task screen with no way back. I have to kill the app to restart it in the clock visualization mode.",poor
"No longer work in Android 9. It can""t load meetings from Outlook or even from Google accounts. Interface is badly designed too.",poor
it only lets you use it linked with Google calendar. You can't have 2 separate things.,poor
Unable to understand the planner,poor
can anyone tell me how to use this app?,poor
"Dear Developer, I have paid the amount for Pro version. After deduction still app is not get updated to Pro version. I have mail you the same issue & asked you to look into. Expecting immediate responce from you.",poor
Looks good but it doesn't sync with events from existing calendars. It only syncs the holiday calendar but not my personal calendar.,poor
its too complicated,poor
Love this app. Got the pro version. It will save a lot of my cognitive work! Please fix this bug: The colour of events are set to blue when the event is created using the default colour of the (sub) calendar. Overall the app needs better UX design w.r.t the complex menu for customization and some other things e.g it was hard to figure out how to get separate widget for different calendars. But in terms of functionality it is awesome!,poor
paid for the pro version but can't keep the changes I make to the settings.,poor
where is the alarm tone setting in this.,poor
"cool idea, but it forces you to use Google calendar",poor
I dont understand anything. it's super complicated,poor
Uninstalled in 5 minutes. It didn't populate anything that I had on my calender. I even tried to manually put in events and it wouldn't show on widget,poor
"BESTApp ever super useful the only reason for the bad review, is because I already paid for the pro-version of this app because it's that useful*!!..BUT it's very disappointing This app is not supported by my Google watch its not compatible with my Ax Armani connected smart watch please fix ; it would be very useful to see my appointments and errands displayed on my watch. without having to open my phone to view than thanks alot I'll removed the bad feed back onces its fixed- 5 stars!",poor
"Doesn't import anything from my calendar despite my calendar being ticked as a source, so pretty much pointless. I'm not double entering everything.",poor
"Does not integrate month calendar view and 24hrs view within the circular widget graphics: it only shows 24hrs (12hrs in free version). Very restrictive: the widget shows full info for one day, and no info ahead, unless you select a different day. For the days ahead you need to leave the widget, and work in a different environment. Why complicate your life? Find a calendar app you like, stay with it, come back to Sectograph when (and if) the widget fully implements time and task management.",poor
Would love this to work. It says it is working (ticks against my Google calendars). Shows a few. Doesn't show most. Disappointing.,poor
not working,poor
"The most complicated routine managing app ever, stay away from this one.",poor
This App is good but the setting is not understandable ... i might not even give it a single star,poor
Won't show events I add to it. Makes different events random flags or sectors for no particular reason. Really annoying.,poor
I wasted my time and money because it doesn't sync to my watch. I spent hours trying to get it to work. I emailed the developer a few times but it took a few emails before he realized that his program doesn't sync to the gears s3.,poor
demo demo ..not compatible with outlook..,poor
took too long to sync. uninstalled.,poor
It's a good app but there should be downloadble templates since it would take time and a lot harder to create your own design.,poor
Did not work on my Amazon Fire 8. app just flashed abou a mile a minute and nothing could be selected.,poor
useless app to startwith.,poor
"If you love complex chronographs and a tiny slice of color tells you all, then this app is for you. This is NOT a user friendly interface . Does not play well with 9.0 pie (but not much does).",poor
Worked fab until recently then I noticed the time in the centre was an hour wrong although when I went into the app it had the time right. So I uninstalled and tried to reinstall but when I tried to put the widget on my home screen it now puts on a blank box that's resizable but invisible otherwise! Very disappointed.,poor
Worked for 2 days. Now I can't enter anything. I enter date time description hit save it says saved but nothing shows up on the lo k dial thingy. too bad nice. oncept. tho,poor
"Debes comprar la aplicación para poder personalizar los colores de los elementos del panel, puedes seleccionar y elegir colores pero los cambios no se verán reflejados hasta que compres la aplicación.",poor
I dont get it in google callender i set a goal to run 4:30 every morning but why on earth is it so that the app sets time on its own and when i edit it it is edited only for one day not the others,poor
"the whole app is based on the system calendar app..when adding, showing... tasks..use APIs but personnalize the design..",poor
not user friendly,poor
okay,poor
"Edit: Reply from developer says sorry if they ""offended my feelings""? Really? This isn't a dispute about feelings. To suggest such is a fallacy. Personal attacks are not welcome when discussing dislike of your pay model. Original: Everything is extra. 24h mode, colors, any default functionality will cost you more! Bad model! Because they can add and remove features and make you pay again or more. Let us pay ONCE for the app instead of you being sneaky and greedy.",poor
Edit: Still doesn't work. I suggest adding proper integration with Outlook because it is leaps and bounds ahead of Google in terms of usability and ease. - Before Edit: Doesn't show me the events already listed on my Outlook calendar. Every day is blank. When I go to add an event with only Outlook calendar selected it wants me to add an event into another calendar. I don't care about adding events (I can do it on another platform) but if can't even see my Outlook events then this is useless. Gave it all necessary permissions and checked dates and synced.,poor
не работает!!!!,poor
There is an issue in syncing and the events are lost in few mins post adding it. The app could have had their own calendar without syncing to android calendar. Please improvise,poor
not even a trial!,poor
"Needs to access data on device, events can't be entered manually",poor
The app deleted my events and made me late for work today.,poor
world's worst app...it uses my phones calander...😭😭😭😭🤮😔😔,poor
i almost tried this. when it opened google calendar so i could create a new event im writing this then uninstalling.,poor
I don't know why I can't seem to be able to adjust the hours correctly. when I updated the time to wake up at 7.30 am but the app keep displaying I'm to wake up at 6.30am...what's wrong? wasted my time keep trying to update it. This is good effort for developer to create this app but can pls fix all the issue...may seem minor but to me it's confusing and thus rendering it less useful. tq.,poor
"it shows you all the features, very helpful and everything and as a final blow... it will tell you that 24 hour widget is only available via in app purchase. This is very very misleading for someone who have given their time, signed in with google, synced their events etc. frustrated.",poor
its not properly work in my phone mi note 5 it always show wedges are not updated i paid last month 99 but it not working,poor
"the planner does not work well. when I set it as every Monday, it shows different days.",poor
"installed, looked like what I was looking for, loved the design. but the app makes me use the standard alarms and calander of my phone to put every bit of planning in, and I HATE the calendar on my phone, thats why I came here... to bad",poor
very bad .. don't download very complicated app,poor
Cant access calendar. Allow access to calendar? Crashes. Waiti or Close app.,poor
Does not connect with your phone's calendar,poor
Unable to use the widget,poor
"It's pure discriminating to have to BUY an extension to be able to use 24-hour mode! Either make it free or let EVERYONE pay for the app! I would love to try this app because it really looks like it has a really nice concept, but since the devs choose to make just SOME people pay for it, then I'll gladly give it a bad review instead..",poor
Unable to see the widget on Huawei Honor Play... After adding the widget to my Microsoft launcher... It does not appear...,poor
"Not sure how this app received such high ratings. It is just making you add events in your Google calendar to create a pie. I don't want to add daily tasks to my Google calendar. I thought this app was going to be more efficient, but it's not.",poor
Bad,poor
Complicated,poor
So it's just a demo to see if you would like to purchase the app. It says it does this so you can learn how to use the app. BUT it doesn't allow you to do anything because none of my info or calenders can be added to it because it's just a demo. So it's really hard to tell if I like something if I can't do anything on it. Something to think about if you actually want to make money selling an app. Just saying. Thanks for wasting my time while I'm trying to save time.,poor
This app only connects you with google calendar and that's it. Not useful,poor
How the app is representing there features were not like that .. We need to buy them all ..,poor
Fix or give me my money back.,poor
The wigit doesn't come with the free version. It does the same thing your Google Calendar can do. I was looking for something for time blocking ... this is time flopping,poor
"It let me add a couple things to the schedule, then when I try to add a reminder to take my daughter to school in the morning and told me there was a conflict. Deleted everything else still said it had a conflict. If I can't easily do the simplest thing it was meant to do I don't have time for it.",poor
"no user friendly, i download this apk for only n only set my full day 
sedual and follow up it everyday but i do not do easy way",poor
I don't like this,poor
"Trying to sync to Google calendar, doesn't work. Now can't find your email 
address!!",poor
Good but hard to use,poor
"For the round watch the program does not go further than demo. The check to 
finish demo is out of reach. But I like the idea of the program. Pitty I 
cant use it.",poor
It just don't work the way I thought it would. Not what I expected.,poor
"Always have to go to the calendar? Annoying and confusing and unnecessary. 
Pity.",poor
"made my phone slow and why to pay money on this app my money has gone and 
no result.widget is not saving and changing.but idea of this app is gud.my 
money gone",poor
"Latest update has made interface unusable in dark mode, and does not allow 
users to change the text colour.",poor
"I am really sad I saw this a while ago and now I got new watch and can't 
enable it on the watch. I just can't find the watch face anywhere",poor
Not good,poor
Not all calendars are showing up in sync calendar list. Events created aren't appearing,poor
Isn't easy to use and it tries to sync with my calendar which defeats the purpose of tracking my personal time,poor
I hate that it's connect to google calendar please make this optional or take it out all together,poor
I have not been able to get this app to work. I bought the upgraded version and that didn't change any of my abilities to sync calendars. Right now it gets a 2/5 stars because it is virtually useless. I will update after I reinstall.,poor
Mot sure why but app does not sync with calendar at all,poor
"Does what it says and has a nice calendar sync function but it is a nightmare of visual clutter, very difficult to comprehend and use at a glance.",poor
This might be a good app. I didn't get to use it because the only way to use is it is to open it with a calendar app. I uninstalled the app because of that reason.,poor
"The most favorite part - add widget to the main screen is unavailable, very disappointed",poor
"I can't see the pie chart style, just markers in the begginning and in the end of events.",poor
Don't wanna have to use a second party app just get my schedules on the planner.,poor
Shouldn't be this complicated n it mess up the existing calender events,poor
Widget out of memory,poor
I don't use Microsoft or Google calendars please integrate with time tree app calendar so I can use your app.,poor
"I hate that you have to use Google calander with this. I may as well just use Google calander. Looking for a better planner to replace it, not exist alongside it. Uninstalled.",poor
"I had it installed for about a month, but didn't find it any easier to use than a normal calendar - in fact I missed a few appointments through using it. It's surprisingly easy to do that as for some reason it doesn't show the whole day or make it clear which party of the day you're looking at. Nice idea, just doesn't provide the at-a-glance info I was hoping for.",poor
"At first I liked it so I wanted to unlock the Pro features, but this can only be done via In-App purchases which means I'd have to pay over and over again for my family group members to have access to Pro. I hope the developers consider releasing a separate Pro version that can be purchased outright and shared with a Family Group.",poor
"I love this app! I can no longer install it on my WearOS watch. The app says ""installing"" on the WearOS play store, but never completes. Please fix this!",poor
I would like to see it in the lock screen.,poor
Romantic,poor
Not easy to use quite complicated for just adding a lunch break ect. Sets events from your calendar might as well use that instead,poor
Is it possible to use this without connecting it to google calendar??,poor
"I liked the app and I really wanna put better rate, but I've got a problem with it.. It has been an hour since I downloaded it,yet I couldn't lay my scadule! I wish there is an option to fix the time region, cuz when ever I forgot to set the zone to my zone, everything is missed up and I have to edit every item again, it is frustrating 😢😢😢",poor
"It's just a widget. They app description made me think it had a lot more features. And don't get me wrong, it might be the best widget I've seen for my calendar. I really think that the description sets the wrong expectations.",poor
Didnt inform me. No alerts. Deleted on the first day,poor
"this was a great idea in theory, but I want a standalone app that doesn't pull calendar data from some other app. for me and for how I wanted to use this app to manage my schedule, this just won't work. I think it could also be more user-friendly. a shame, since this really is an amazing, unique idea. devs, I hope you keep working on this and take this as constructive criticism. I would love to try this app again if things change and it becomes a more flexible standalone calendar.",poor
Not flexible enough for my needs,poor
Wish it didnt have to connect to the calandar. I wanted to keep my phones calandar widget separate from this but its impossible. Disappointing.,poor
it is so stupid that i have to be coneccted to my calender and cant just create what i want. to much work not worth it,poor
"very complex ui, it needs Google calendar and doesn't work without it. I needed a app like this but as a daily planner! not just showing the calendar events from Google Calendar stupidly on a clock.",poor
The widget doesn't auto update after I add an event. Always need to click the manual refresh button. Same goes for when I delete an event.,poor
Can't sync calendar unless you pay which makes the unpaid version useless to me. I'm not going to go through my entire calendar and add my events by hand to a second calendar. Pointless.,poor
"I have been using the fully unlocked version of this application for over a year. This is a fantastic app! However, it lacks the capability to sync with outlook calendars. For example, if I have subscribed to my work outlook calendar in Google calendar, the events will not be synchronized with Sectograph. This would be fine if this was the documented behavior of this application. However, subscribed-outlook calendars are selectable from the calendar selection menu...",poor
"Ok good to know, thanks! It still won't show all of my calendar items on the clock. I'll put some on and it will take them off as I add more.",poor
It was a good app until this most recent update now my widget doesn't work it's not syncing with my calendars I'm losing dates appointments,poor
"After last update the widget became very small, and clicking on it does not open up the full app. Also won't sync to my calendar anymore. Uninstalling.",poor
Wish it didn't force me to use Google calendar. I wanted to start a new calender off of this app,poor
Don't know how to use,poor
"This is exactly the app I was looking for to visual my day, as the clock face just makes sense. However, only being able to add to the schedule via external calendar apps makes this completely unusable. I tried to use it to better manage my routine, but my calendar app became so full of menial tasks that I was unable to see my upcoming appointments and events of most importance. It has amazing potential, but is currently only good for basic planning. Very disappointing.",poor
It just keep on showing only one event whereas there are more than one events,poor
"Events won't show up on the clock after I adjust the time of the event. They show up, and then I change the time and they disappear. So, so frustrating. :( I wanted to save time, not waste it. :( Why? Why?? ? ?? :( Why?? 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ :( 🤦‍♀️ I used this app for 5 minutes and then hit a roadblock. Why?",poor
No adding option for the time,poor
Great idea in principle but it's so hard to work out what's going on that that so far it's useless :-(,poor
"I'm going to start by saying who segments their hours on a clock into fifths? That's not standard and just annoying. Second, why can't I add events from the app? It ALWAYS redirects to Google Calendar, so what is this app even good for? I'll just use my calendar, AND it will be easier......",poor
Was working fine before. . But it's not working now..not registering my events,poor
I really like how amazing it is on my phone. But I'm so disappointed to see that it can't be downloaded or visualized on my new galaxy active watch...,poor
Sync is not good,poor
"Cool concept, but unusable for Google business users because all of your coworkers calendars are selected by default and there's no bulk ""deselect all"" button.",poor
It dont have Alarm feature,poor
"I have problem with purchasing the pro version. When I click on ""Buy Pro"" button, it says ""Already purchased. Please restart the app"". I have not yet purchased it though, and nothing happens when I restart the app.",poor
Never tried it yet,poor
"Certain of the event doesn't show up in the clock, just recorded in my calender.",poor
Not in sync with my google account. Bad in regards to automatically getting what I planned and plus I can't use it when i am using my PC!!! But thumbs up for this Sectogragh the idea is brilliant. Please work on updates because very soon i might not use it if i still have to re-enter all my days task and activities!!! It should be able to get data from my google account and i should be able to use it on PC. PC is really perfect use for this kind of app!!!,poor
"This app doesn't seem to show multiple calenders for the same google account. P.S. In my Google calendar, the desired calendar has got Sync enabled still the issue exists. P.S. 2- In the My Calenders menu, it is not even showing the second calender which I have made for the same google account.",poor
Not that good after using,poor
It does not ync eith al the calendars,poor
I downloaded it but don't know how to use it ...really messed up app,poor
It good and useful app,poor
"This app was exactly what I was looking for. a visual of the day in clock form. Only issue is, if I add something to the clock it adds it to my calendar. I don't want that. I want an app where the calendar and app are separate. This was supposed to be for studying and exercise. I didn't want to have to add those things as into my ready packed calendar. it was a fast uninstall. Iif there was an option to disconnect the two, I'd reinstall.",poor
"No option for reminders, it doesn't show reminders of my google calendar. And i dont wanna create events for my daily habits LOL",poor
I'm just not finding time to work with this app. So by no means the star rank im giving the apl is just a TEMP ranking.,poor
"i love the ideia but the executation is not good, i want to put reminders for every day and know what i need to do in a clock like that, this app needs his own callendar and clock for we customize without messing up anything on the original apps in the phone, this need a every day reminder, routine and stuff",poor
The widget is feezing after every night,poor
"couldn't change time zone, its an hour ahead and no setting to select my time zone",poor
Does not show reminders,poor
"Correct idea worng execution. The watch face UI cannont be operated like manually moving clock hands. The time zone stick moves at an interval of 1hr, I wanted to set it at any choosen time and add reminder from there. Big flop was it did not read my calender event and yes I did give necessary permission. phone - one plus 7 OS build- Oxygen OS 9.5.5 GM57AA Further Action- Uninstalling Outlook- Would like to try it post improvement",poor
"I dont like that it only works with calendar. i dont want a calendar even called ""sleep"" just to keep it on the graph",poor
couldn't exactly figure out how to use it,poor
the current day shows events for the next day and seemingly no option to change it. very annoying.,poor
Not a fan - liked the idea of diving into main areas and percentage of your day it occupates but what flipped me up was scheduling a reminder - daily. I started getting a morning reminder of the task for the next day schedule for i.e 7pm!!!!! -i mean what about task i have for this day ahead!!! i don't need to be notified 27hrs ahead of my daily rutine - seriously🤮,poor
when adding a task it transferring you to Google calendar then after adding the event it doesn't appear on the widget?,poor
"Not a single event, appointment, meeting, etc...is showing up. going to uninstall after rating.",poor
"The app itself is really nice. I like how the widget displays my schedule for the day, it.gives me a very nice grasp of my time. The bad thing is that it slows down my smartphone, I have a S9, and it drains a lot of battery. It makes my phone lag and ""stutter"" when I try to open it. I uninstalled ans reinstalled apps to check my theories, so I uninstalled this one, the phone was doing so much better. And I even PAID for the Pro version!!!",poor
"I granted this app full access to my google calendar, but none of my events show up in the diagram. It remains completely empty except for national holidays (like National Tartan Day on April 6th. Yay!) I've given this two stars instead of one because this •could• be awesome. The design is great.",poor
"Updated: I want to love this but like others have said, it doesn't work with all calendars as claimed. To get Outlook or any other calendar to work, you have to have your calendar sync with Google, which not everyone wants or can do. It also only works with Google's smart watch, not Android Wear OS smart watches. Great look and idea, but very limited by being Google only.",poor
Acceptable,poor
not exactly useful. was hoping it would be easier to see or more customizable.,poor
doesn't sync to my smartwatch 😞,poor
"Hello Team, I am not able to set different colours for different sectors. Could you please help me show how its done?? I purchased your app in light that It will give me option for above.",poor
tutorial did not explain much and too confusing to figure out the benefit of using this app.,poor
otherwise the app is good but i bought the full version and did i exepet to get customization fratures atleast give to feature to mark different sectors with different colours... very disappointed ... you guys should consider making the user interface less complicated...,poor
"It would be a great app if it had an option to use it without syncing it to your calendar like TimeTune. I don't want all my tasks to show up on my calendar, and their solution wasn't working.",poor
good,poor
😶😶😶😶,poor
useful for organizing the activities of the day but don't have setting on sound to notify the time of activity,poor
I like this app but it's always saying it has stopped on my phone,poor
"There's no simple reminders or ability to add to do task, everything has to be added via calendar which is irritating me...app is useless right now",poor
Not good,poor
hi i can add just 1 event why i try to add more in google calendar it shown but in this app it's not show up,poor
too confusing not neat,poor
"Really beautiful and great idea. It is unfortunate for anyone who doesn't buy into all things Google and don't use Google Callander. In this day, building your app to only one service is not a good idea unless it's for the iPhone. Now if I could get my work calendar on this app, wow, what a great way to visualize your day. Just playing with the demo showed me the power of this style.",poor
"No graph showing - shows the task sector on phone app, but on watch its just the bare bones time with no events charted.",poor
Once installed the app was showing another time zone.,poor
Doesn't let you choose specific calendar events to ignore. No way to track how you actually spent your time if it didn't match your calendar,poor
"This app doesn't show all the activities of my Google Calender, so to me the app is quite useless. I even checked all the available calendars to make sure the settings were right. However, the concept seems to be great for people with a busy agenda, but since it has no use I unfortunately had to delete this app.",poor
"I loved this app, but after the new update I am unable to use the widget. Uninstalled.",poor
It only works when linked to another calendar app....and it's difficult to change the time from am to pm.....,poor
Couldn't get the rest of my calendars to appear. Feedback help wasn't clear as well. Uninstalling,poor
"I like the idea, but it's not working with Outlook calendar properly. This a big drawback for me.",poor
Does not sync with MS Exchange calendar,poor
"I got this thinking I could use it as a gear 2 watch face. It's a cool idea 
but would be much better if I could use it on my gear 2.",poor
Pllllzzzzz make it for ios also,poor
Very confusing. When problems occur the resolution isnt made clear.,poor
"Beutiful and easy to use once you get used to it however I wished creating 
an event was a bit more simple and quick. Update: no longer syncs to my 
calender and the dates are all messed up....too bad I loved it",poor
"The app is fine but the widget never became available on my phone or watch. 
The widget was the whole reason I used this app.",poor
"Even after entering an event into the app, it is not displaying on the 
clock face, and it says 'no events'. What's the point of the app when it 
doesn't do what it says it can?",poor
"Doesn't work on my ASUS ZenFone 5 (ZE620KL) It doesn't show up whenever I 
add the widget in my home screen.",poor
"I'm sure it would be great if it didn't pick and chose what events to display from my calendar. I have multiple events logged in my calendar, the only calendar it's synced to and the only calendar those events are logged on, yet just one of them shows up. It has a lovely design, but that doesn't mean anything when the app doesn't actually work for what it's intended for.",poor
To complicated and let's you set things up only to then tell u It's not available,poor
"In my last phone, Asus Zenfone C, I can use this app well, but after I changed my phone to Samsung J7 (2016), it automatically connects with either Samsung or Google calendar, where I can't edit the event colors freely on the clock. I'm very disappointed, so I had to uninstall. Sorry.",poor
I couldn't sync this with my work email and doesn't seem to give me the option to.,poor
Can't adjust center clock size. Can't open alarms by touching the center clock. The image for opening the app on the play store doesn't represent what you can customize the clock to look like as a widget. Augh. Cool but lacking necessary functions.  EDIT - I was not able to click the center clock and open my alarms. Not sure why. But the developer said it is possible.,poor
Could not get app to consistently stay connected to my Google calendars,poor
I love the idea but there are syncing issues.  Events take forever to show on the graph regardless of whether i entered them in the sectograph app or my google calendar.  They show up in my google calender almost automatically regardless of the same.  Also i think 12 hour clock makes it tricky to read since the switch from am to pm is in the middle of the day.  I have something starting at 12:30 and i cant see it on the sectograph but there is a little arrow at that start time with the first letter of that event and nothing else.  It's confusing.,poor
JUST works with Google calendar. Can't use it without it! Uninstalled,poor
not working properly on redmi note 4,poor
"Good app, missing vital a feature - it shows meetings not being attended. I.e. Going = No.  That is an obvious feature that stops me from giving a good rating, I must keep company meetings in the calendar that I'm not attending for posterity - not unreasonable I think? So this is a must.",poor
The only thing that is missing is to open specified event after click on a widget. For now I can give for stars. I'll give more when this feature will be available :)  Edit: after upgrade adding widget to homescreen only allocates place but is invisible. When it finally showed up it doesn't have promissed functionality,poor
I couldn't understand it probably my fault but I find it complicate and I like to organize my day like without go and add on my calender just on this app but like I said it's probably my fault / gonna try this app again later maybe like after couple of different updates,poor
The idea is amazing and it's useful except it stop working(can't show its widget) after update...,poor
How does it work ?,poor
It doesn't show reminders. Not much useful without reminder display  support.,poor
"It displays awkwardly, has backwards date, malfunctions to a point where the widget does not display, has a small central area, has no 1x1 option, has complicated descriptions for functionality that should be easy to understand, but I can buy a widget pallet, which many apps have as standard for free, for $3. What's not to love?",poor
"24 hrs shouldn't be extra cost, can't import from my Google calendar and too many left and right arrows, confusing, too few colours for the sectors.",poor
It could be a very useful app but it is not very intuitive. Why should I set up the date in google calendar and not directly in the app?,poor
"Interesting idea, but useless.",poor
I was expecting it to sync Google reminders also from google calender. I use them a lot. It has so much to do but since it cannot sync reminders like how it does for events. It's not what I am looking for.,poor
"The widget doesn't update with the system time, often stuck until I interact with it, greatly impacting usability. I have locked the app to not be closed in recents, and a fix to this issue will change my rating.    I did pay to customize the clock face, and it's far better than the default choices though.",poor
"It was a great app but after today's update I am finding few menu items in some other language, even after setting the default language to english it is not helping. Team please help....",poor
Does not show morning event's,poor
The entire rating goes to the UI. Widget does not refresh with time which makes it pretty useless.,poor
"Interesting, just not for me.",poor
Stupid app,poor
Purchased app palette. When I try to use it app stops every time.,poor
Great idea. Very slick. But when some appointments appear and some don't  when added correctly from inside the app with add events there is something wrong. Can see them on the calendar but not on the widget.,poor
"No way to change the font size, so most of my events just display as ""Meeting wi..."" which is basically useless. Can't even click on the event to see, I have to go to a different calendar app to see what I have to do. Which is the one thing a calendar widget should do for you.  Edit: in response to the creator's response to my comment, it IS important to keep in mind that this is a free app, with no possibility to upgrade, meaning this is not a professionally-developed app, so there should be no guarantee or expectation of quality. So if what you're looking for is a free app, then this might be a good app for you. However, if you're looking for a calendar/agenda app, then probably not.",poor
I'm not digging the new widget design. I don't like the time in the middle now and I hate having to touch the little icon. It was better when you could just touch the main part of the widget.,poor
love the idea however I use outlook calendars for lots of things and this only works with google calendar 😔,poor
"It is a solid idea but the widget does not work properly anymore on my LG V10. It either does not load it properly, or it loads it properly but the clock will not update. Any help?",poor
"Need more customisation in widget's font, colour and others. Clock in the widget is not working properly. Sometimes, clock stuck. On that time, I need to open the app. I'll download it, if you fix that",poor
graphics,poor
Doesn't seem to work on Samsung Note 2.,poor
Nice idea but if you have busy scedual it is not clear enough. All meetings are in the same color. It is problematic specialy if you have overlaps meetings.,poor
I have tried to sync it to my Google calender account but I am unsuccessful if anyone is able to point me in the right direction please,poor
May be good for you. But I can't comment further.,poor
Like many others I find it too small. Would replace 12 Hours with this if the option to increase the size was added. Edit: Just noticed the last update was 3 years ago so guessing this won't happen,poor
Is there a way to set times without syncing? If I set a daily morning task for example then it will clutter my other calendar(s) with that task. If there's no way to set it so that I can do daily time schedules without clutter then it'll have to be 3* from me.,neutral
I deleted it... I don't want to use my calendar,neutral
Good so far,neutral
Good. Getting to know.,neutral
Difficult to use,neutral
Thank you for such a gud sectograph this is so nice and perfect but i want the alarm should ring louder/to adjust but it's not available I think if it's there pls let me know how to adjust the volume.,neutral
Google - Drive app intrall,neutral
Good but unless you pay you can't enjoy the good stuff,neutral
Very useful app but need alram feature too,neutral
Nice. Even cute. But it turns out I dont use it so much cause it uses my private google calendar.,neutral
Nice app,neutral
I like this app but would like to see future dates to see any conflicts in schedule. Would be nice to have some font size selection in widget. No matter how big you make the widget it can be hard to read for those with less than perfect vision.,neutral
Don't like that I can only add items through the calendar. I don't put everything on the calendar that's on my todo list,neutral
"Really good idea. Clearly shows what's coming up in my day and helps me manage my time. The one thing that winds me up with it is how it ""fades"" into the next clock-face. I decided to pay for the app to have he 24-hr clock display and I would much prefer if the display changed at midnight rather than partially showing tomorrow and partially showing today. It's really confusing to look at and makes it difficult to visualise the day as a whole. The lack of this option feels like an oversight.",neutral
"I really really enjoyed the app, but I have a few problems. first pls make it so we can add daily routines. bcs some stuff I have to do daily like take medicine or drink a cup of cold water and it's tiring to have to add this every single day so pls add the daily feature. second every time I need to add an event I need to go to the calendar and add it there. so I literally have to use another app to be able to use this one. pls make it so we can add events from the app directly. thank youu",neutral
Confusing for me but several friends enjoy it.,neutral
My app doesn't show reminder on the screen. Previously it was showing. Which settings shall i change. Plz guide.,neutral
Good but very buggy,neutral
"Great in theory, doesn't play nice with outlook which is s shame as this could be the next must have app",neutral
"Really cool idea, but not supported on my Wear OS Fossil Watch (Gen 3). I was able to hack it as a watch face via the Wearable Widgets app, but it's not optimized. Please add watch face support for Fossil Wear OS devices!",neutral
Yeah,neutral
Would give a 5 star if it worked on my galaxy watch. Need more detailed instructions. Can't find it on my watch.,neutral
Is this have an alarm mode?,neutral
What if I dont want it to use internal calendar...?,neutral
Difficult to use,neutral
"This is actually really useful, given the kind of arrangement they chose - showing tasks like the arms of a clock so it's really convenient for us to know , at what time which tasks are there to complete. But the problem is that when there are more than one task at the same time, the texts superimpose on each othr and we can't read thm. Considering they use Google calender to set up the tasks, I feel like Google calender itself & its widget is more useful than this. But 5/5 for User Interface🤩",neutral
How'd u adjust an event duration ?,neutral
This app look cool on the screen but it was hard to figure out how to use it the could be more settings added to the app so people can make it more direct for their life.,neutral
Hey. Will there be no reminder function on this app?,neutral
One of the main bugs in this app is that the widget's time doesn't update on its own. And the time gets stuck at any point.,neutral
This app would be so amazing if you add ' repeat weekly/2 weeks ' feature . We would then be able to use it as a time table ! Please 🙏,neutral
I wanted to use this apps independently of calendar. The apps is well done but it comes as a doublon of calendar and it become not useful for me.,neutral
"Downloaded yesterday and was pleased by the overall design. I'm willing to pay the app for the full customisation, however, the app doesn't sync with my Google Calendar's Reminders and Tasks, which what I use the most instead of Events which only this app allows. Hope this could be improved.",neutral
It worked fine but after android 9 latest updates it fails to update the widget and have to open the app to do the same,neutral
Good,neutral
It's been good can't complain,neutral
Nice,neutral
Drain too much my battery,neutral
Its good but not that much because after completing the tasks they didn't appear in the list it must be in one frame at a place down in the list . Secondly it doesn't provide u the notifications properly it just ring like a bell that is for a single second,neutral
Still learning to use app.,neutral
"Almost excellent app, unfortunately (and surprisingly) it's missing Outlook integration so I'll use something else meanwhile.",neutral
Usable.,neutral
Not user friendly,neutral
"Is it possible to use the widget on my Samsung active 2 watch? If so, then how?",neutral
"Quite complicated, need simplification and please remove date from the daily routine planner. Just make UI more user friendly. ""And for your response and consideration 2 more stars :)"".",neutral
What is this - NEXT ALARM (SYSYEM UPDATE)???,neutral
Average app,neutral
"It is good, but you should add some predefined themes in the palette and not only allow the user experiment",neutral
"Confusing without a lot of explanation on what is what. Might be good when I figure it out, but it's not a real intuitive app and has a figure it out curve.",neutral
"I love this app ; the only thing that would make me like it more would be if the text wrapping on the sections made more sense. Sometimes the titles of my events get cut off and placed in odd spots in the sectors. Also I've found the colors are very limited. When it looks into my calendar to match the color my calendar has for events, it gets it wrong or doesn't have the color.",neutral
"Good idea but there is on reapeat routine, i have to add evertime so make me hang more. And its work only 12 hours basis",neutral
Felt very complicated when i am flying high.,neutral
This just displays your calendar as a time sector. Whenever you click on + it redirects to calendar.,neutral
"Limited use so far, every time I i touch the calendar icon the app changes to calendar but will not revert back to watch face unless i uninstall and reinstall no back button",neutral
Lot of difficult methods to organize.🙅‍♂️,neutral
Best app to mannage your time,neutral
Not able to open events into another calender app. It always opens events in my native mobile calender app,neutral
"I like this app a lot, it is refreshing but to be 5 stars I should have more flexibility in setting intervals, like selecting days of the week so I can have work and nonwork day schedules that easily repeat. When I add something to a schedule a 10min before alarm should not be default, I'm using the app to plan my day primarily. Finally each new entry should default its begin time to the last entry's end time, with the new end time shortly after, say 30 min later. That would be a 5 star app.",neutral
It is useful but very user friendly,neutral
It's a cool way of getting at a glance your schedule. The theme could be more colorful,neutral
"Great app and well thought of, love the wear os integration. However paying for the full version, I wish there was more customizable options such as custom background or custom font for the numbers. Would be great to include that.",neutral
Good idea but I cannot connect it with my smartwatch,neutral
Well this is awkward but I cant even find widget option for this app in phone. Downloaded just an hour ago so this has to be the latest version I believe. The whole purpose was to have a clock on my homescreen that has my calender synced. It doesnt seem to that. May be I'm missing something here? I'll definite give an update of this review if I can figured it out.,neutral
"pretty app and probably useful too, I just don't like having to create calendar entries. I thought tasks would be managed within the app",neutral
"Seems like a good idea but the widget is invisible. It is there, I can see the edges when I try to move it but it's completely invisible. I tried decreasing the widget transparency and deleting cache but to no avail. Devs, any clues? Thank you",neutral
"When I first downloaded this app I loved it. I enjoyed being able to see my day at a glance and everything was working fine. For some reason the widget will not open the app for me anymore and I have no idea how to fix it. I tried to uninstall the app and install it again and it still doesn't work. Anybody has any suggestions, I'm open to them. I use an android. Just to clarify, the app itself is still working, the widget is not.",neutral
"Not sure yet,still testing it",neutral
"We need an update!! I love this app and use it daily but the fact that we haven't had an update in months bothers me. Here are some suggestions I have: add a settings option to default the amount of time you spend on a task (I use 45 min.), more color options for tasks, an option to change the notification sounds for each entry, a 'push all back an hour' option, and more widget options! Thank you I love this app but we could definitely use some upgrades!",neutral
it is difficult to set an event or goal without a tutorial,neutral
Good,neutral
I don't friggin know yet. I JUST installed it. Note. I haven't spent any time on it!,neutral
"The app is really useful, one must download it but it just have one problem that we need to refresh the widget all the time to see current time, unless we don't refresh the widget we cannot check the upcoming event through widget, if you can solve this, this is one of the best app for daily use and surely you'll get more pro version users of this app. Thank you.",neutral
"Seemed like a good app, but doesn't always show your plans. It's linked to my calender and I've added quite a few things for the month, but it only shows on this app once and then disappears next time I look at it.",neutral
I do not understand how I will add events. I tried adding events but it only shows up in my calendar not at the sectograph. It seems to be useful but I need to know how to make it work.,neutral
Widget doesn't work,neutral
I'm liking it but it seems to have some bugs. It's currently 01:13am but the widget and app are still showing yesterday's calendar sectors and event list.,neutral
Just a fancy Calender widget. Sure it looks fancy. But it doesn't add any functionality. It can't do much else. It can't track progress.,neutral
I love the design and the app in general. I would give it 5 stars if it would allow to size the image and the information displayed.,neutral
Great app👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿,neutral
Everything good simple and easy to use the best one but you dont get reminder as alarm so that you can actually know the schedule its just give a notification which can be easily ignored by mistake .....please fix this and link it up with alarm too just like you did with default calendar app,neutral
too tricky. complicated ..not immediate.. maybe isnt what i need...i need something more simple..,neutral
Works well until you purchase Pro. After this all your calendar dates are displayed one day ahead (your events on a Monday in your Calendar are displayed on Sunday).,neutral
"The time in the center of the widget, most of the time does not get updated. You have to open the app and then the widget is updated.",neutral
"It doesnt seem to be possible to delete a single event in a series. So if I want to block off an hour every day for the same thing, but then I have to schedule a one-off thing during that time, I can't just delete one occurence and leave the rest of the future occurences alone. I love the app otherwise but this problem is pushing me toward a different app.",neutral
Good app but need improvement,neutral
Its a nice app. Liked the design also. No option to copy paste same schedule to next day.,neutral
"This is a good planner because it's easy to use and understand, but the widget consumes a lot of the phone's battery.",neutral
"the app work just fine, it was my commitment that had problem 😂😂😂",neutral
still trying,neutral
"Got this, loved the free version. paid $3.99 for PRO and still don't have the ability (or can't figure out how and there are no instructions) to set different calendars on two widgets on my phone. I'll be happy to give you 5 stars if you send me a how-to. Also, it says there is time tracking. Does that mean I should be able to do a start-stop on something while I'm doing an activity?",neutral

"It's pretty neat. I love the how everything pops out on the clock. Only thing is I tried scheduling things after 12 PM and it wouldn't pop up and I notice it only shows 12 hours at a time. If you buy the pro version it comes with the 24 hour feature, which I think is totally worth it. Seeing 24 hour option you can see everything from start to finish and not miss anything.",neutral
"nice, but there seems to be no way to hide declined events? that makes it much less useful. Would give 5/5 otherwise",neutral
"it just opens a-calender, so I'm not sure why I need something between me and my regular calendar app.",neutral
"Nice app! I just cannot work out what these random numbers are within the pieces of the pie... 35, 30, 7:35, 30, 8:35, 30, 8:35. it is clearly a countdown of some sort but bears no relevance to anything obvious. How can I remove these? UPDATE TO REPLY: Thank you, but I am seeing 7x this info around the pie and personally it serves little use. Can this function be disabled?",neutral
I uninstalled because the app was a little confusing. it has a great idea and all bit I just didnt quite get how to use it...,neutral
great app just need one thing is second hand also like minutes and hours the. i will 5 star and its best app,neutral
updated:. was confused that the event list in the actual app wasn't showing events scheduled for the next few days. The widget will only show events in the next 12h. The event list in the app also only shows events in the next 12h. I think this list should list events for that entire day. this means i still depend on other apps for an agenda view.,neutral
needed a standalone platform which does not connect to any of my calendars.,neutral
Seems good but I would need admin approval to access my work Outlook calendar so it's pretty unusable for me.,neutral
really great concept but .......not much useful and not even that beautifully eye-catching thing,neutral
I really like the visual round of this app however I would love to be able to personalise it more easily...,neutral
it 's good,neutral
good so far. only used a few times may review later on.,neutral
"Sometimes it shows wrong time, make me confused most of the time",neutral
its ok,neutral
It's an interesting tool but having one or 2 things on my calendar per day it does really make sense for me to use it. Looks nice.,neutral
I don't like to put on google calendar every schedule,neutral
app is great but the events are not getting created . Only one two events for a day is created than even it shows created its not,neutral
"Added feature synchronizer Connect, added the note writing feature during the call, added a feature synchronized with the mail",neutral
I would've liked to use this app but sadly it doesn't seem to recognize European daylight saving time. I've gone through the settings twice. This is a deal breaker I'm afraid. I would still recommend people try the app however if the live in location where DST is rightfully ignored. The main concept is really clever and the widget is beautifully designed 👌👌,neutral
Wish i could add events without having anything to do with Google calendar,neutral
cant get demo to play .its probably a great app..,neutral
Looks cool but I do not find it actually helpful unless you write down everything you do every hour every day.,neutral
Sorry I dont get it. I have no idea why seeing my schedule on a circle is somehow better than a rectangle. What am I missing?,neutral
awesome app,neutral
It would be much better with an ability to have a report at the end of the month as to what was worked on and when. Ie statistics.,neutral
"can you make this app a separated planner and can make an event without using calendar? i really like this app, but i want this app as my daily task organizer and my calendar as a big event organizer, so it won't jumble up in my calendar.",neutral
okk,neutral
"Hi! the range of the nuce coloured sectors does not cover the time interval of my events. It had been the best reason why I chose this app, to have an easy, straightforward overview of my plans. Why doesn't ut work as it is shown on the pictures?",neutral
"I really have wanted this app to work, I'd really prefer to see my day filled on a clock in such a way so I even came back to try again, however I'm having trouble putting tasks in! After a certain amount they stop saving. I'm also struggling to see the clock in a way that makes sense. It looks very jumbled. Best of luck, I love the concept!",neutral
Good app but needs to add daily To do List,neutral
"I had to pay for the option to change the colours, then I had to pay more to customise it further... exploitative money grabbing like this ensures I'll never recommend it to anyone else. Works well though",neutral
"a little confusing at first, but it transfers your calendar and alarms to the app. one bad part is it adds everything on your calendar. like if you add ""eat breakfast"" it'll go on your calendar. so that's only a little annoying since my calendar needs to be clear and easy to read. but besides that. it works well",neutral
"This is a great app but... I purchased it to be able to use it with my Samsung gear s3, little did I know that I can't use it with my watch bc this app was made to be used with android wear (which I found out later my bad). So, will you be working on making this app compatible with Samsung gear? That would open your market quite a lot with Samsung gear users. I've been using the wearable app with my watch but it doesn't work smoothly at all. Please work on that if you can, thanks!",neutral
good app but had to uninstall. kept adding reminders to all off my tasks and scheduled events even when repeatedly de-selecting them. very frustrating and inconvenient to get the notification and the email notification.,neutral
Time zones not supported? Missed a meeting today... :(,neutral
Not as I required,neutral
its db un to use,neutral
Is the feature of different colours for different tasks available for the free version too ?? I m actually not able to set it that way. No sir... I did the way u told me to do... It is still not showing different colours,neutral
"I have changed my mind and have bought the 24hr clock version. once the app is fully updated and is working how I want it to use, I will review accordingly. I have gave 3 stars as it is the ""middle ground"" for now.",neutral
"For 24 hour version, need to buy app. no free trials",neutral
fine,neutral
"I would give this 5 stars, if not for the misleading in-app ""smartwatch settings"" extension purchase option. I love the app, but I purchased the extension to use it on my galaxy watch and I have been unable to connect it to my watch and use any of the settings for a ""wearable"". If this app can be used on the galaxy smartwatches I would love to know how.",neutral
Nice visualization of personal activities,neutral
ok but need to improve,neutral
not bad,neutral
"So far, its working for me. I needed something that could ring or vibrate.",neutral
Still want to go thoroughly with this app,neutral
any way to resize font so short events can still have a complete (or at least longer than 2 words) display?,neutral
cool idea. woupd be good if it could access my outlook calendar,neutral
It would have been better if it kept its own database rather than relying on the calendar. I don't want to put trivial things to plan my day in my calendar. Uninstalling.,neutral
"Impressive.Could be better if it had its inbuilt calendar which is linked with events of Google calendar .it should also have to do list with with alerts,a weekly planner.thia will make it perfect",neutral
Haven't used it enough to truly rate it but it just seems like there could be some big innovation if you put more thought into it. A lot of potential if you ask me though.,neutral
Pls add 24 hour view,neutral
It's great. I love it.,neutral
Recommend,neutral
"If you want something that syncs to your calendar, you are in luck! It really is beautiful and such a wonderful idea. However my 3 star review comes from the fact you can't use it without syncing to your calendar, and there by having it affect your calendar. I was hoping to use this as an hourly time management tool, much like a block system, but I can't have it be that AND have my calendar be a place for just appointments. It makes the actual calendar look too full and messy. Basically in short, can you please add an offline tool as well?",neutral
After the recent update displays alarms an hour earlier than they actually are. Been using the app for more than a year now and love it.,neutral
It don't work with Samsung gear s3 smart watch even after i bought tge widget!,neutral
"Love it, great time management app, one thing I think would be great is if you guys would add a feature where it shows like a chart of all your time from the past say like past year, so you can see where you are spending your time cumulatively, instead of just the chart of how you spend your time each day, which is still super helpful! But adding a chart of how you spent your time in the past would be great! Would love to see that feature perhaps on an update of the app!",good
How do i see all events and other day events instead of only today within 12h only? Is this what you mean by 24h clock in pro? Will it also show other days with pro? I like the app but some things ar not very clear to me. Thanks!,good
Great App. Love the layout,good
"Epic! BUT when I go to a later date like my future birthday (21st May 2021) and I touch the hand of the clock to slide it, it takes me back to 21st of May 2020! Why does this happen?",good
"The clock-face schedule calendar I was looking for. However, since last update, clicking on event on the widget doesn't enlarge the event so I couldn't see details unless I open it in the calendar.",good
"I don't usually do reviews but this app is honestly quite great. It really helps to plan my day visually and the widget helps a ton when I open to my home screen. My only complaint is that it does end up crowding my calendar app because it requires you to add an event to the calendar but past that, it's pretty great. Most planner apps don't work but this blew it out of the park",good
Wish it could sync with Google task 🙄 😕,good
saya bisa manage waktu saya. mantep tp harga pro mahal nih. diskon dong,good
It's good app to use.,good
"I really liked the concept of the diagram as that's exactly what I was looking for. The only drawback for me is that it takes the events from the settings/android calendar, which is not what I wanted. I would prefer to set events in the app straightaway. I will download it again if this feature becomes available in the future. :)",good
"I bought the pro version. It's a really great app... Simple clock widget to display all my plans for the day... I used it on my smart watch n it's really useful. I don't know if it's a bug or not, but when I touch the event on the phone widget and it shows the detail, after that when I touch the ""X"" button it wont go back to the clock face but open the Calendar instead. And I can't move the watch hands around to see the othe upcoming events. I hope there'll be update about these. Thanks alot",good
Very nice app. Any chance Tasks and Reminders can be integrated into the display as well?,good
Extremely helpful for a visual thinker like me but the pallette settings are confusing and should be the same for all watch faces. Having different colors in the app and in the widget and on the watch face is distracting and confusing,good
"Works for me so far, like it!!!",good
"It's really great app and per partner for day-to-day life. I'm giving only 4 🌟 star because while selecting any sector time ,some time it shows different option or sometime it shows correct option but giving another time sector information.",good
Not very easy to navigate the settings,good
Love this app! I have always thought of time on a clock face and this just makes so much more sense to me than the list of things you get in Google calendar and other organisational apps. My only suggestion for improvement would be more colour customisation of the segment (events) and the option to link a segment to a checklist. I have found a way to do this but it means I need to use a URL link to redirect it to said list and that takes an extra click and is a bit fiddly to set up.,good
Great app,good
Great app. Love how it learns abt my events and notifies me accordingly.,good
It's an amazing app It shows us how much time we take for homework's and etc. This is really useful app for me hope you get the same experience,good
I recommended this app to everyone because it's very useful app especially for students like me,good
"Great app! It is working very well for our family in planning our days! Would like for it to fully interface with my calendar though - so I could edit from Sectograph as well. Otherwise, I think it is an excellent way to spatially visualize time management.",good
"There is a delay in updating, but apart from that a fine app.",good
"I've always viewed time as a spiral, so this fits perfect to keep me visually organized. The app is very clever, fading out old events while revealing new ones for the next time around the face. Everything is customizable allowing you to make it look exactly like you need it. The only thing I want that would bump this to 5 stars is in app alarms. I don't like relying on the calendar's little one-time beeps. Allowing me to set an actual alarm I have to silence would be great.",good
Very good App,good
Good to have this as my memo,good
Very good app. Helped me a lot,good
Love this app,good
Synchronisation is not happening. I wailt for 6 hours and hit sync icon many times but it will not appear all events added in Google Calendar.,good
Just started to use this app. Seems helpful so far.,good
"1)Add feature to Copy created event to add them further in the schedule repeatedly without hassle. Manually entering each event must end, it's a waste of time. 2)A feature such that just by rotating the dial of the watch by finger we can make next event in the schedule. Eg. We select duration, we click on okay and then we add title to the event to create there task. 3) An option to switch between weather we want new start time for the event or just continue with finish time of the last event.",good
"You asked me if I would recommend it. It's a cool app. I like the simplicity of my other calendar a little better. I know of another cool device. I call it a Lev Drive; interested? Yes, it's just theory for now.",good
"Useful, easy to visualizer what's upcoming and plan my day. Just a pity not able to track my actual time spent to see where my time went. So I'm also looking at time tracking app while using this as a scheduler review thing.",good
Helpful,good
Good but confusing for new user,good
Smart app help your organised your daily Tasks,good
Its very helpful,good
I'm using a free version and it works very well. Keeps me up to date,good
Nice app,good
"This is neat, I like seeing my appointments displayed like this. Wish there were color theme options for the free version.",good
"The app is OK, pretty useful and feature-packed. Before it's usable though you have to spend a minimum of an hour to set it up. The UI is so-so too.",good
Recommend to try it. 4 starts as nothing is perfect. Not because it isn't good enough.,good
Good step learning curve,good
How can i change the notification sound ?,good
Does exactly what it said it would,good
"I've been using the app for quite a while, and it seems to work well with Google Calendar, showing my events for the day as claimed by the devs. While I have not experienced any issues and the widget is a must-have on my home screen, customisation options are very limited for free users. That's not a big deal, but I do wish we had at least a bit more.",good
"I like this app. If it can sync easily and automatically without delay, I will give it 5 stars",good
Very nice and innovative calander app only one thing is multiple widget like squre and rectangle also Widget event font was very small there should be option to increase font size to proper visibility....also it show next event instead of curren event... thanks,good
Good apk,good
Great. Really helps me visually percieve all my tasks with time. Wish the interphase was more customizable tho.,good
I love this app. I just wish that there was an internal calendar in it so that I didn't have to create and turn on a calendar in Google Calendars in order to receive alerts for events in Sectograph.,good
I'm still looking forward to it's impacts at this point.,good
Excelente aplicação. Boa integração com Google Calendar e facilita a Gestão do dia e da semana. Parabéns aos desenvolvedores.,good
I'm still trying to figure out all out. I'm unsure if I want to buy the upgrade. But I like the idea of it.,good
"Work well as my need, except it can not be watch face on Samsung watch. I try it several days and love it. So I purchase the pro version, wish to use it on my watch as it said can be used with Android. I didn't know that Samsung watch is different OS, so it's incompatible :( However, the developer show responsibility by refunding the money. Anyway, I still hope it will be able to use with Samsung watch soon. Keep up the good work!",good
Really like this app,good
"I am using the paid version and this is really good, love it. Quick question...I want to integrate this with the Samsung smart watch. Is this possible, otherwise deserves 5 stars. Please add option to integrate more than 1 outlook email calender Account and also themed design faces we can choose from for us who are bad at colors.",good
Interesting alternative to combined calendars and notes. Very visual approach that allows to focus on what matters. Time is a scarce and unvaluable commodity. Let's manage it as it should !,good
"Like the latest updates, thanks",good
An excellent time keeping tool. Would it be possible to have a separate 12-hour widget and another 24-hour widget? And it seems that the manual update button in the Home screen widget is not working for Microsoft Outlook.,good
Good App,good
"If alarm connected, will be the best one.",good
"I like the concept, and the free version is passable, but it seems like a lot of features are locked behind the pay version. I may end up purchasing, not sure yet.",good
Glitches with all day events in outlook,good
"It is a great app, buy there are some problems, your widget mostly do not sync automatically with my phone's clock, so eventually I have to open the app and set the widget to match the clock. Please fix this, thank you very much.",good
Good app,good
"I used to have this as my default watch face, but lately I can't put this on my Android Wear device. Maybe my Ticwatch is too old for the latest version, but it used to be the best. Does anyone know how to put this watchface on their Android Wear if it doesn't show up automatically?",good
Love this app! All time based/entire day events in visually streamlined view.,good
"very nice app, except Saving everything to my calandar.",good
"Lets me see my schedule VISUALLY, neat.",good
"Very close to being 5 stars. There are just a few oddities in the user interface (and possibly slight inconsistencies on what the app is doing) who means that for some the word ""buggy"" might be applied. I'm more inclined to say ""unpolished"" in certain areas... But a great app none the less",good
It's ok. But I can't put the clock onto my home screen.,good
It's good. Can still be improved. Looking forward to it.,good
Very useful,good
Its really smart idea to see at a glance from your homescreen all your planned activities,good
"Very nice app but, 1 Reminders are not showing in the app. 2 All day events start from 12 in the app which makes them less readable when there are many all day events so, better make it customizable.",good
Good,good
this is good app and it has a beutiful widget,good
Nice layout,good
Easy to use. Love the format. And widget format as well. Works perfect for my frienfs business that i work for... I can help him get and stay organized and were less likely to forget important things. I love how i can organize the scedule and set reminders while im at home relaxing and he can instantly have it on his phone as well. Barely any adds which is awesome!!! GREAT APP for what i use it for and im sure it can be great for alot of different situations. :),good
It's really a great app to organize your life. Good experience 😃,good
I love this app but sadly it does not work with active 2 watch. Imagine the possibilities if you could have this widget on a wearable .,good
"One of the best productivity apps on the Play Store. I had recently purchased the app to customize the widget and colors but find it difficult because it could not load the existing wallpaper I am using, on the preview. It is also hard to try and mix different colors to see. It would be best to have the customization be seen real time rather than pick and see color. Thank you.",good
"Great APP! Detailed yet concise (with only the information I need). Amazingly, it is packaged together with one APP so effectively.",good
"It's really a good app,but they need to add some more features to it like copy schedule and some other good features.",good
Nice,good
"I would like to buy the program, but I do wish to use a different address.",good
Excellent,good
Good app but I can't get it to shade in the entire timeframes of my activities like in the photos here. It only has a line at the end time.,good
Love love love this app... but you guys can add some more features to make it a bit more easier to use..,good
Good app,good
"This is seriously good and so far it has worked flawlessly. Just that, sometimes, it takes a bit of time to update the calendar entry on the app. But i don't mind.",good
"Good app and so close to what i was looking for, but it's missing one thing. If you could add an option to add your own tasks WITHOUT it having to be an actual event that'd be awesome. I don't want to add ""wake up"" or ""gym"" as an event in my calendar.",good
I'd say it's great,good
Good visualisation. Would be great if the widget came in a dark version as well and transparency could be set.,good
This is a good apps. But I think it will be better if the widget will show in the lockscreen too. So it will be easier to check the plan. But offer all this is a good apps. Still find no problem up till now. Maybe I'll try the premium version to see the more features.,good
it Is A Nice Application,good
Annoying that you can't change the color background of the dial with the free version but otherwise very useful and fun to use,good
"Seems good for people who use a calendar already, but I hate Google calenders and Outlook alike. I couldn't figure out how to create my schedule without using one of those terrible calendars so I uninstalled.",good
"Really nicely made and very useful app and always a looker for others! Recently however, it always shows some phantom alarm clocks I did not set...",good
Wish for larger text. Difficult to read.,good
"Really great, but no project-task relationships that i could find. So grouping things is hard except coloring them manually",good
This is good application for the procrastinators who usually wasted their time on phone without any reason. I like the sectograph because it let me push to do the work of hat makes any sense. So I recommend you to use this application 🤗,good
I like the graphic,good
Useful but still needs more integration to Outlook ... I'd like to load my colour categories that I already have in outlook calendar in my visualization. Calendar by week numbers is also a must have ... I'd like to know also the percentage of availability of each day based on my events. It could also integrate with my alarm in order to know at what time I wake up ... and so on. The potential of this app is huge,good
"Very good app. The only note is that it takes a while to make it syncronizing properly. But after you get it, works like a charm.",good
Very cool app for keeping track of your tasks and schedule,good
"I like the app/ widget, i wish the center was a lil bigger or bold. I havent had an issue withit, other than that.",good
It takes some getting used to but then when you start thinking of it as an analog watch it sort of works.,good
Really like it. Would love to be able to manually resize appointments and add new appointments into arcs with free time.,good
Enjoying it so far,good
"Cute, love it but bugs, no alarms that's the only thing keeping it from being 5 stars for me.",good
Good Android widget: 👉For watching planned schedules everytime at ease on the home screen. 👉 For syncing all calenders to view birthdays & events at one place.,good
I really like this app I find the the way it presents the data in a clock face with countdowns to your EVENTS very useful. The one drawback for me is that it doesn't integrate with Google Tasks or Reminders. This means that everything you want to see needs to be created as an event. This is not a massive deal but I do like the convenience of tasks over events. The widget sometimes loses synchronisation with the clock and shows a different time than the actual time.,good
Just please add reminders / notifications with custom sound 🔊 and more colors 😊 and please make the wedge /icon display description of the event or auto degrease the letters size to fit more than 1 word or add a fieldnto type title that will be shown/edited in the app even it comes from another planner without titles. 🙄,good
Love it just need galaxy watch face even paid (fair price),good
Great App,good
Excellent work,good
"Best app. Works perfect but giving 4 stars due to colour settings, whenever you try to change colour of tasks there is a problem that you touch a colour and it selects other colour like touch red colour it selects blue. This problem is in all colours.",good
"This is a great app, but i dun like it link to my calendar, because it will mess them up. Prefer if this is a standalone calendar, so that i can separate my schedule in this app, and other schedule in my calendar",good
Functional,good
"Excelente programa, me ha ayudado muchísimo y puedo ver de forma gráfica todo lo que debo hacer en el día.",good
"If u make an app for samsung gear , I would love that.",good
Classic,good
Quite helpful for daily tasks,good
A bird's eye view to your schedule.,good
It's nice and helpful,good
Excellent planner,good
"App is great overall, but unless I'm missing something obvious I can't seem to put the widget on my home screen?",good
Its very good.,good
How to make the sectograph appear in the home screen,good
The app is real good and helps in improving the productivity! An improvement that could be made is to hasten the sync up with the calendar. It is taking quite a long time to reflect in the sectrograph after adding any new event!,good
Nice app,good
Great app to track your daily schedule. One thing what would be great to have here - displaying the scheduled reminders from google calendar. Unfortunately I do not see them.,good
"Very effective. I would give 5 stars ,but writting space too little. Larger writting space will help much better.",good
Really fun view of your day. Still figuring out how to use it well. It would be nice for the widget palette to also be visible inside the app but it's not a huge issue. I could easily see myself changing to 5 stars once I get used to it.,good
Good app,good
"It is a good app, really ok, but I don't like that, you oblige me to rate. This is a no go...",good
Nice app. Quite original,good
It gives a nice visual look at the day.,good
"Good app, but not exactly what I was looking for. This app uses your calendar events and organizes them in the circle. The controls are great, I love when I move the red time bar it scrolls through all the things and shows the time changing. Love the widget. I wanted this to work out a homeschool schedule. I ended up having to make a new calendar and syncing only that one. I was able to change the colors of each event in the app. Very easy to use overall.",good
"Very good Well, it's a great app. I just wish we had more free features. It would be a rmgrest investment.",good
Needs improvement,good
Its a neat app,good
"You can add one thing, when we'll touch on particular time period then the particular task should be displayed.",good
Good app but need to something more,good
Very good app! Helps me stay organized.,good
"Nice App but not able to use widget (Nokia 2.1 , Android Pie)",good
Very nice app and easy to use,good
Overall impressive app but it does not updated in real time. Always showing delayed time until manual update.,good
I really like the app. it's pretty cool! How do I get the 24 HR clock on my Android wear? 5 stars if the 24hr face can is possible on the watch! 🙂,good
I started using this app in 11th std & I'm getting its benifit but the only thing is that it doesnt shows the tasks we have to complete in some monutes or if two tasks are to be completed simultaneously in a hour. So I humbly request to make some more changes in this app so that everyone can use it more comfortably.,good
Ok,good
"Neat, but I don't put that much stuff on my calendar.. Looking for more of a scheduling tool for everyday routines. Don't want to add all that stuff to my calendar.",good
"Now realize will not show appointments over 12 hours out, however would think should see them in overall list, but not on widget....good but could be just tad better.",good
Nice,good
"It took me a while to understand how to use certain features, but once I did I found it to be EXACTLY what I needed! If Google would allow reminders to come through, it would be the PERFECT time management tool! My only thought would be if there was some sort of tutorial or guide to help know what some things were for (like when I'm changing the color scheme, I can't always tell what's what) For those not wanting their calendar clogged up, just make those things hidden after you've added them.",good
Useful,good
"thanks to you, this app makes me more concentrated and schedulable in my days, and its efficient visual time widget on the home screen is really practical. But sync between calendar and app is a little time-consuming.",good
This app is very helpful but you need to control yourself to done schedule on time.,good
"I like it, also I would like, like a wedget but for the block screen. Then you don't need to open the phone, only activate the screen in order to see the next task in your calendar",good
"ótimo o app, porém ele é meio que um relógio de estudo que marcar cada segundo",good
"Its your calendar on a clock, best if you have a smart watch...I dont. But still a great app if your a visual person. 5 star if I ever get a smart watch!",good
Lot more easy and practical... maintaining calendar is fun...loved the widget,good
"Best watch once you understand it. It takes a while to set up just the way you want it and to actually ""get it"", but once you do it does exactly what it promises. Its sleek yet informative and by far the best ""at a glance"" app for your homescreen. The watch addon is the cherry on the cake. Only improvement in my opinion would be to add multiple different widgets. Like give me the option for a small simple one on my home screen and a bigger more detailed one on my office screen for instance.",good
I love this widget!! It's such a clear picture of the time and schedule!! My only thing is I wish it was compatible for the galaxy watch! I got the app because I saw it on the watch I'm the pictures but it doesn't work with the galaxy watch. 😕 If this was improved to work with the watch I would give it 5++ stars.,good
تطبيق جميل ويساعد حقا,good
Good 👍,good
Good,good
This is so helpful! I use this with the forest app to stay on task. You can add different calenders from Google and keep work and personal separate.,good
Really good,good
Good application 👍,good
É um aplicativo pra quem é visual se você ê mais chegado a listas não recomendo o uso. Mas é um aplicativo muito bom para ver seu tempo livre e o tempo que você gasta com tarefas relacionadas a eventos,good
A great tool to see what's going on in your day. I linked work and personal calendars into one. The customisable buttons are a nice touch and allow you to make it work the way you want it to.,good
"I think it's pretty cool how this app communicate with the calender, smart watch greatly enhanced the experience as well, good job. I just wish there was a galaxy watch version of it. :(",good
Very helpful for busy scheduled hard workers.,good
"Cool app! Can almost replace the other widgets I have on my home screen, but missing one feature (which is not the fault of the app, but a shortcoming for my particular needs): weather. Include weather and I can easily pay for this app! Still keeping as it is a good app!",good
Doesn't support Fossil sport watch anymore?,good
Nice app but haven't been able to explore it's full potential,good
Excellent,good
It's a good tool.,good
Doesn't really sync with my calendar as events are added... *Edit: user error with delay in google calendar.,good
Good visual representation of my daily schedule and to-do list. A great way to remain mindful of how time is spent during the day.,good
A very good Pie chart graphical view of your schedule with nice colours and everything is good about the app specially the graphical side. I'm not a pro owner but also rating 4 stars because of the glitch in app today. My whole sector were invisible today and it just showed blue colour filled circle with only an area of 45° looking as faded blue. And nothing else was there. I also have screen shot of the error if developers need it. Else it's a great app. Soon will buy the pro version.,good
Nice,good
Its great app & it should be complete free but of course nor maybe few updates.... Than I'll rate 5,good
♡♡,good
Very useful! Syncs with calendar and lets you easily see upcoming events and tasks,good
I used to be able to tap on the widget and it opened but now it doesn't. What's the point of the widget if it doesn't open? *Was able to quickly fix in the settings. Thanks for the comment.,good
Beautiful,good
"I bought the pro version and like it so far. For now what I'm really missing is the ability to change days from the widget itself, with the left and right arrows, and not only from inside the app. Why wouldn't you enable the left and right arrows to change day as default? Having to go into the app to review past or coming days defeats the purpose of the widget, and forces you to use something else other than the widget itself. Other than that, the app seems to be very practical. If the ability to swipe from one day to the next day or to the last day from the widget gets implemented, it would be a 5 star app for me. Thanks.",good
"I've been using this app and the watch face on my Moto 360 for close to about a year now. With all my events for the day (and the next day) visible on my wrist, I can keep track of my calendar easily. However recently, the watch face is defaulting to 'Simple Clock' (default watch face) whenever I use the watch. It only affects Sectograph and it has been bugging me since.",good
Unable to tap widget to open app and open calender since update!!!!! Thank you for response. Sorted,good
Great app.,good
It is better to have more choices In time repeat Like I want do some jobs in some days of week Wendsday sunday and monday,good
Its good for me and it really helpful,good
It is a very helpful app,good
Very nice setup. Thought enough of it to pay for premium. Couple things - add ability to change watch hand colors (arms match scheduled event making it impossible to see) - add ability to increase watch face inner diameter digital time (difficult to read). Watch = Ticwatch Pro 4g Phone = Moto Z3 w/Pie,good
Very Good!,good
Need to update the calendar more..... otherwise perfect,good
This APP's widgets can't realtime refresh in new android core 10.,good
Great app!,good
Good,good
"Amazing app. One of the main reasons I like having a smart watch is to keep track of my appointments on my wrist, and this has been one of, if not the best way I've tried of having easy visual access to my daily agenda. The visuals is seeing the hand move towards my meetings and the time listed until then is a great touch as well",good
This makes it very easy to get a quick glance and understanding of my schedule. I love how it shows how much time is in between and before an appointment. It makes life easier to plan. Great visuals too.,good
"Good app. I agree with other reviews, the addition of tasks will make it great. Update: The new edition seems to be less useful. It seems one need the pro version to get it to work well. revised update. The app is very useful to ser in one vie appointments highly recommended",good
Good for those who work well with visual prompts.,good
Very nice!,good
It's nice to see the day at a glance.,good
It thinks about the day the way I do,good
Best time planner,good
Good app. Thank you. Very helpful 🙂,good
Awesome!,good
Good,good
"I love this app...it really helps with planning and the widget really helps. The widget looks like a clock, so it's like a clock and tells you what the schedule is for the day...you can customize the way that you want the clock to look...",good
Amazing 👏,good
Great app. Must have.,good
This is all i ever wanted from a calendar.,good
Extremely easy and user friendly. This app is amazing for visualising your day. Works a treat for people with busy schedules or people exploring time blocking.,good
Used on Motorola phone. Synchronization to Google let me get all my notfactions on my Samsung phone my windows PC and three different Linux flavors from ubuntu 20.04 to Arch to Parott OS.,good

Really good app! The widget replaced the clock on my main screen as soon as I realized how effective it was at keeping me on schedule.,good
This is the App that i've been waiting for,good

Love this on my home screen. Thank you!!!!,good
It is simple and easy to use! I like it very much and have used it for almost 1 year.,good
"Super helpful for my ADHD, and the dark mode is soooo much better",good
"Amazing app, PLEASE MAKE A SMART WATCH FACE FOR THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",good
Best one,good
Love having the visual to show time in a spatial way,good
Update: They are slow but they update and sync slowly. Overall very good app. Very buggy with time. The times are off. I think it's a sync issue with google calendar. It doesn't work even after fixing sync issues.,good
When i downloaded this application Sir.. Really.. I am succeeding in my career.... There is no application like it... Sir thanks to u.. We cant explain that what have u gave us.,good

Very useful and user-friendly app. Best schedule app I've ever used for today. Thanks a lot!,good
Awesome app. GUI helps to identify the utilization of our time.,good
Love this absolutely easy to work with and so helpful. Thank you!,good
"Excellent for visualizing your day and ""where you are"" in your agenda",good
Loved it since day one. It is now one of the first apps I install on a new phone. For me it is a must have. So easy to manage time. Like a watch for meetings!,good
Good,good
"I recommend this app. Very good app, Nice work developer/s, Thanks for creating this app. This app helps the user to get things done smoothly, It helps the user to manage the time and also you can track everything you do.",good
I really love this app! It's especially great if you have several things to do in a day. You can see everything at a glance.,good
Nice.. quite an appreciable !,good
Awesome,good
Amazing,good
Really well designed and intuitive to use,good
Gracias a esta aplicación me he podido organizar mucho mejor.,good
Amazing visibility on your day,good
"Sectograph is so helpful for me to visualize my day and how I'm going to spend my time. It's almost like a pie chart of my time, perfect for this visual learner. What I would love is a companion app (watch face or widget) on Samsung Galaxy watches so I can see it on my wrist, too. I use the the widget on my phone's home screen all the time. I love it!",good
The best,good
A very nice app for time management. A good User Interface.,good
amazing app for Scheduling,good
Very helpful for visualizing your day/time commitments. This has helped me to better manage my time and stay productive longer than I used to do on a traditional calendar.,good
Great tool for visualy keeping your schedule at the front of your mind! With my ADHD i suffer from time blindness and this tool coupled with agressively scheduling time to update my calander makes a great way to keep track of what i need to do and when.,good
The idea of daily workflow as a clock widget is great.,good
Love the way this app shows my day - works like my brain does!,good
Helps with managing my ADHD by making my schedule easily visible on my homescreen!,good
"It's clean, simple, easy to use and such a helpful reminder of my day's schedule without being pushy. It's helped bring structure to my day, whether I follow the plans to the T or not.",good
Love this app. So helpful to see schedule and time differently.,good
I love this app!,good
"Love this app, it's very helpful.",good
Really like the widget. Being able to set the center to actually open the clock app is a big plus for me. Very well done and useful.,good
"Great app! Would kill to be able to spin/advance the time hand on the widget! But understand this is probably a limitation of the Android operating system. Aside from that, this widget has been a key factor in improving my daily productivity a significant amount. Integrates perfectly with my Google Calendar and Google tasks. Thank you developers! Life savers!",good
"I bought the full version and I am quite gappy with it. It's a cheap, one-time purchase, and it gives you a bunch of extra features.",good
Loved it.. But keep improving and make brilliant experiences for customer,good
"First impressions: excellent app. settings page could be more organized, but widget usability more than makes up for it.",good
The sectograph view adds a lot to the traditional calendar representation.,good
"I love the concept. This is something I've been looking for a long time. I have installed Sectograph; however, I haven't been able to make it work using sync with Outlook. I use Exchange as corporate email and this app is really practical and useful for my work. I have tried sync my calendar with google but I haven't been able to do it in the right, fully automated manner. I was able to sync with Outlook however even when the app is connected and without any issue the events does not show. I have tried what you explain in your FAQs without success. I'm a little bit frustrated since I'd love to use it but it seems impossible. I'll really appreciate any hint/help you can provide me. The 5 stars is for the overall concept, since I haven't been able to use it yet.",good
"Heads Up, ADDers!",good
"Most useful widget I've ever gotten, it keeps me well in track and as a person with ADHD this is a lifesaver",good
helpful,good
"I have ADHD. Time management and planning are my worst nightmares. This app makes it so easy to SEE my schedule. The visual representation of the wheel makes it easier to make sense of how much time I have. It's also SO helpful to see how far I am into my day... I could go on. It's a great app and worth the premium price, but the free version is also fantastic.",good
Good time management,good
KAMU.HARUS.DOWNLOAD.INI. PERIODDDTT. VALID. NO DEBAT. Ini bagus banget 😭😭 nyesel baru tau sekarang,good
Great,good
The experience with this app has so far been awesome. It has helped me a lot to plan the day.,good
Stylish and useful,good
"Nice visual to organize and follow schedule. I would like to add personal routines... exercise, time bonding with children...but this app does not promise this..",good

Good stuff,good
Awesome app! Easier to keep track of schedule and never forget a thing.,good
Awesome.,good
"I like it, incredibly useful for seeing how busy my day is at a glance.",good
"Most of my issues with this are due to Google Tasks not syncing with Google Calendar on Android, although I do believe they are testing roll-out of that by region. Makes my day feel like a Majora's Mask adventure, and really multiplies my concentration. An absolute must-have.",good
"This app is EXACTLY what I was looking for and it's really well made. I soon decided to buy the upgrade, as I love being able to see 24 hours at a time and being able to switch between that and the 12-hour view, but thank you so much for making a very good, usable app for free as well.",good
Smooth,good
"A great, and unique way, of viewing your day.",good
Great app,good
The visual combination of events and clock. It works for me.,good

Very good time keeping app. Great work developers.,good
Amazing... Love it,good
Loved it,good
"YOU CAN GET THIS ON YOUR WATCH FACE TOO!!! Beautiful way of displaying time and events - my ADHD brain LOVES this. Nice customization of calendars, colors, and displays- don't be afraid to play with the settings. To get on your watch, install the smartphone app, then go to google play on your watch and select ""apps on my phone."" From there you'll get the option to download Sectograph and then ""set watchface."" Ps. Buy premium! One time payment and this dev deserves to get paid for this rad app.",good
Loveee It!,good
❤😊,good
it's so useful,good
Good,good
"Really good app, made my day more organised.. Thanks to the developer...",good

Loved it. Please add notification feature for events before they start (5mins or 10mins),good
"Nice apps, i've using this for 2 years and still counting",good
Pwoli saanam myre 🥰🥰🥰🥰,good
"Great for visualizing time segments in a clean, organized format, pulling from your Google calendar(s). If you're more of a visual person and tend to overestimate or underestimate the time between tasks, or easily lose track of time, this may help.",good
Very Useful App To Schedule Your Day,good
So helpful!,good
I love the unique idea. I've used this for my past two phones.,good
Great app!,good
"I really like this app and it is definitely a very nice visual way to keep track of time. The one MAJOR issue I keep encountering though is that it does not seem to easily sync with my Google calendar, which is where I have all my daily tasks stored. Edit: after trying a few troubleshooting options (including the FAQ suggestions), I was finally able to get Sectograph to begin syncing again by uninstalling and reinstalling Google calendar. It seems like it was a one-time glitch. Love this app!",good
This is perfect for me. I find it really easy and quick to use this app and maintain my daily routine. Also it looks Kind of cool on my home screen and the colour coding helps me too. I would suggest to add some more colours to choose from.,good
I love the concept,good
"I think this one of best time Calendar app. Sometimes I miss meeting or delay. This is giving me full visibility, I don't want to go and open any calendar app to see my shedule , it's Infront of me all time.",good
Perfect for time management,good
Awesome,good
Loved it. Need some minor improvement like smooth syncing.,good
"As a law student, this app is the perfect fit for me to keep track of my class and study schedules. Sectograph also goes well with Forest App.",good
The widget is useful to see what's next in a glance. Looks very good as well.,good
Simple: I have used many apps but this is best....,good
"One i was looking for. Thanks a lot for this. So helpful to keep track of time and events. When your have the view of whole day in front of your eyes, it helps a lot to plan your day. Request: please add Android watch face. U kept your promise. Thank you. Request2: Please add galaxy watch face.",good
Extraordinary one of the kind,good
"Nice visual way to see tasks coming up, the analog format really lets you see how long a meeting or task will take. And you can sync with calendars!",good
Superb Routin management,good
It works. Really. From a person who cannot plan and get things done. The colors are really helpfull and the graphics make you feel like doing the stuff.,good
I love your widget. However now with samsung phone I cannot add it under my work profile. Di you know why? Is there a workaround? Thanks!,good
Great app,good
"I really didn't want to like this app, but now it's on my home screen and I use it all the time. Great way to display my schedule!",good
One of the most innovative and productive app found in the appstore.,good
Pe rfect management,good

"I like this app because it helps me to set my working,exercising, teaching, sleeping time... and I want to request one thing add alarm feature for tasks...that will help much better",good
Great way to visualise your day.,good
Gr8 app,good
Visual layout really helps,good
It's very useful app I advice it,good
Awesome,good
Amazing app! Never found anything like this,good
Nice looking,good
"Excellent and fun, easy to use!",good
Very good app. Its a good planner to maintain a professional life.,good
It's great schedule reminder but do get the alarm system also,good
This is a good start of an era redesigning how we visualize our thoughts. A great place to begin Dallas time to add the functions and abilities which make this format more powerful than traditional,good
We need it,good
A very novel and original way to display my calendar!,good
Beautiful use of screen space and ease of use. I use this to keep my entire day on track in an easy and informative format. Continuously updates and displays 'next in line' scheduled events.,good
This is a godsend.,good
"Ty for this app, I have ADD and this will help me a lot in understanding time and not forgetting everything.",good
Good stuff. Finally got into learning chinese and russian,good
Excellent,good
I really like the app. I set things up on the phone and then use the watch companion as a watch face to see how my day should flow with activities and events. Nice customisation. So far I love it! Enough to upgrade to the paid version.,good
Great!! I use it to manage homeschooling.,good
Great! Easy and helpful,good
"Very very happy with this one... Thank you, developers...",good
Good app,good
Simple to understand and use,good
Great app helps me to structure my day and not be lazy,good
Great time visualization tool,good
Too complicated,poor
UI sucks. Hard to get things done.,poor
This app is not working!!!! 🤨,poor
Bad app.,poor
I paid for pro version but still it didn't update!!! Where did the money go?,poor
I DO NOT LIKE IT,poor
"Used to use this app, stopped for a few months, then came back to find that the app had been completely changed and that ll of my routines, tags, etc...had been wiped out. I'm pretty disappointed.",poor
Used to be my fav organization app lost it for a year. Found it again. The new UI is DISGUSTING.,poor
Can't understand how to use,poor
waste of time,poor
Can't turn off notifications. It will keep ringing. Idk if I'm missing something. But I love the app but if I cant figure this out might uninstal,poor
Too much ads,poor
"I find it utterly useless. Tried to figure out how to use it and it seemed like a maze, so incongruent and all over the place. I eventually deleted and discarded it.",poor
This app is not working in my infinix s4 It gets blocked by the system so please improve your app and fix it,poor
It not working for my mobial. it not remaind at the time what i set,poor
It does not send me notification when i open this application it shows troubleshooting background running,poor
This app is very confusing and hard to use,poor
There is no account sync option. If you uninstall it by mistake do all the hard work again to set up the events and periods.,poor
Stupid app dirty app not at all useful. The ones who made this app might be fools. I created a routine but it doesnt show any pop up . Stupid app,poor
The notification stopped after some time,poor
Aak thuuuuuuuuuuuuu,poor
Will anyone tell me how to use this app ?,poor
y?,poor
I spent almost 2 hours to figure out how this works. I still don't know how .,poor
I really tried to like the update. But it seems confusing. I'm not sure what was wrong with the way it was before but now I don't understand how it works.,poor
Its good but too rigid.. Add option to start the routine from a speicifc place as we wish... Say we wake up late.. I want to start the routine late instead of just going late at the old routine. .. Add a button for that please,poor
Very bakawas,poor
Not so good,poor
I think it is like a time table box like structure (just like diaries) from inside but nope ☹️,poor
Good and fast,poor
its wonderful app but thete is something much important missing CHECK LIST it should have check box so you can tick mark after doing it And this should also reflect in week summary so that YOU KNOW HOW MANY DAYS YOU MISS THAT TASK,poor
"Sufro de ansiedad y TOC, han cambiado el diseño de la aplicación SIN PREVIO AVISO y no te están las cosas como yo deseo, cómo hago para regresar a ver los colores y los íconos, ESTO ES REALMENTE MOLESTO",poor
Best,poor
"This is one of the best apps, one of the best features is that it announces the activity name...... Edit: Hi, the app was doing well! And was planning to buy the paid version. But i am getting errors with background tasks not refreshing, and today due to that error, i lost all the events scheduled which were scheduled for today. Can you advise please?",poor
this app sucks,poor
"Try to make the app more automated, i have been following every steps but still it shows no notifications or alarm on time",poor
I love the app but I'm probably going to have to uninstall it. Its had a problem lately where the notification will not go off. No matter how many times I push close or silence the sound keeps playing. It's becoming annoying.,poor
Uninstalled within 10 minutes of confusion. What to set where. Not user friendly. Not able to set routines daily programmes. Very confusing settings.,poor
Only notifications pop out no sound at all,poor
"If you want to use it properly, you have to pay for the Pro version. It is not user-friendly.",poor
Love it🥰🥰🥰,poor
I paid for premium but I did not get any notification or upgradation. Still the app is showing the purchase premium option. Feeling disappointed.,poor
"Not working properly , don't delete immediately any routines ,",poor
So bad bad bad,poor
"I paid for the premium to save my data to upload to my new phone. Didn't work, deleted ALL of my info and when I reached out to tech. support, no response...",poor
I don't know anything can anyone help me,poor
The tutorial looks simple and a good layout but when I make an entry 9 out of 10 times it disappears and I need to re-enter it. Half the time dosent work,poor
Nice,poor
Not easy to use also not effective,poor
Sucks,poor
This app noticification sound didnt work...always silent and vibration ...i done everything,poor
Dear developer I am the paid user of application. No notification sound is coming. Please see the issue urgently.,poor
It is very awkward cauz you need to give it a proper plan,poor
Awful the concept is great but it is not user friendly and super annoying I deleted it as soon as I downloaded it,poor
"Awful, it has timing issues , when I reach the end of the day , it leaves an empty task and u cant delete it.",poor
I am unable to download this app.. everytime I click install it just doesn't download it,poor
I would not give a star also bcoz the thing is it should have more function....Next time when i download the app ....it should be a good app..... TROUBLE SHOOTING..^_^^_^^_^^_^(^^):-[:-[:-[,poor
Hate it,poor
"I have autism and downloaded this at to help with my daily habits and routine. Used it for less than 5 minutes, couldn't make heads or tails of it. The instructions given apon installing were more confusing than helpful, terrible layout.",poor
"I bought the pro version yesterday and today in the morning it's asking me to purchase again ... Contacted the developer and if no answer is received within 12 hours, I'm reporting this app for fraud.",poor
"It literally just completely stopped working yesterday, without me changing anything either in the app or in my settings. Whenever I add a new event or routine now it just doesn't create it or show me notifications, my schedule stays completely blank. Lmao I'm sorry but it doesn't even bring up the technical report when I press it",poor
"The layout was horrible, the events and the scheduled items don't sync.",poor
"I have the app set to verbally remind me of schedule events. The problem comes when I have my phone set to silent. The app supercedes the phone and still verbally reminds me. If the phone is on silent, it's for a reason. There seems no way to bypass this. This is a SEVERE flaw that needs to be addressed, hopefully sooner rather than later.",poor
All the features are premium 😐,poor
"I loved this app so much after I downloaded it and used it for about 2 weeks. Because I loved it so much I decided to purchase the pro full version and payed £4.99. However, it was not worth paying at all. I would have rather used the free version with the ads. I will recommend everyone to download the app and use the free version but dont get the £4.99 ad free version because it doesn't really give you anything extra. I would recommend the creator of the app to add more features for payed.",poor
Premium version only,poor
I was unable to understand anything..... This app is a big mess,poor
Doesn't let me add even one item to my day without buying the pro version.,poor
A hidden wonderful music comment and feedback is correct please do it like previous it was,poor
Bought the premium version long ago but now it has ad on it.,poor
Asking to buy pro version when clicked on new program,poor
Didn't like navigation menu location update,poor
Terrible,poor
Very bad,poor
too many ads and require to pay for applications that are commonly found in play store.,poor
New update has ruined the app...the reminder option is no longer available with ringtones...why the heck should I keep this app now in my phone... deleting....,poor
"Does not refresh on Samsung phones. I have done every troubleshooting step and more, to no avail.",poor
"Pop up stating "" the app has been blocked by the system. Please authorize the app in your device settings. Troubleshooting or refresh background tasks "" is flashing on my device. May I know what is this about?",poor
can't even name my tasks,poor
I don't know how I feel,poor
I got just scam. Rs. 200 for pro version. Nothing happened. Good times.😒,poor
Doesn't save my timeline ....have to redo my while schedule now,poor
The tutorial doesn't help and shows you nothing the app is very bad and isn't easy to understand I have given up after wasting time trying to figure this trash out. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.,poor
I was looking for a class schedule app and this was not it,poor
"The app would be nice if it actually gave you a tutorial on how it should be used. It seems almost like clickbait, with one appealing look and then it's not what you expected or needed. Yes it's very organized and but nothing is explained.",poor
Not very user friendly. Uninstalled immediately,poor
Pagué por la versión premium y ahora igualmente veo ads en la app... La app no cuenta con respaldos automáticos ni un login al menos decente. Lástima que una app tan buena la estén dejando perder ante el montón de apps de productividad que hay en la store,poor
Worst app dont install,poor
The one thing that made this app better than the others was that it was ad free. Uninstalling.,poor
"To me its not user friendly. I dont like the question up front before a tour of the app. Its very limited unless you pay for the pro version. I think, when picking a routine or something a bar or something should pop up with options or ideas to choose from.",poor
Useless,poor
confusing and useless,poor
not easy to use....always begging to buy pro version.,poor
This app has started to give me full screen pop up ads,poor
I buy pro version but it features are not given to me,poor
Couldn't figure out.,poor
🙄🙄🙄,poor
Bekar app at all !,poor
"Too difficult to figure out how to set up, can't add times to daily routines. This app is a waste of space.",poor
Hello. The app keeps disappearing from my notifications. I already allowed notification access and persistent notification on my settings. I also whitelisted the app on my battery saver but it still doesn't work. Help please 🙏,poor
It was to difficult and takes a lot of time to create a routine,poor
Very bad app,poor
hard to use,poor
"Not user friendly at all, they definitely need to work on the user experience.",poor
Terrible,poor
Very bad,poor
Oohh im very hardly managing it and its a disgusting app just a waste of time. Also it is not uninstalling.,poor
Nic,poor
Not really functional,poor
"bad, the reminders not working many times trouble shooting",poor
Way to confusing to use the tutorial didnt help at all,poor
"Cant even get past the first screen. I get a notice that my phone is blocking the app, but there are no instructions in the troubleshooting for my pixel, I've looked all over my settings, there's nothing I can find to change to ""allow"" this app to do something. Frankly I'm dubious that this app somehow needs some extreme level of permissions that no other ever has, especially as it hasnt told me why.",poor
"WORST APP EVER! Because there is no reminder bell things, I think there is but it DOESN'T WORK! I can't even remember that I have this app! With reminder thing will be better. I SPENT TWO HOURS TO WRITE MY ROUTINE PLAN, AND I THOUGHT THERE IS REMINDER! IT'S NOT EASY TO USE THIS APP TOO! I AM DELETING THIS USELESS APP IMMEDIATELY! ALARM DOESN'T WORK AT ALL!! HOW DISAPPOINTING. 😠😠",poor
Bad,poor
bad,poor

worst app doesn't work,poor
worst app waste of time,poor
i really didn't understand the interface and its too complicated ...,poor
way to confusing to do something simple,poor
"Looks great, alarms don't work. The notifications just don't work on my Motorola G7 plus running Android 9.",poor
the User Interface makes no sense,poor
not good worst app,poor
app looks good but does not notify me on my oppo. i foloowed the instructions to fix this however they are outdated so i cannot fix this problem.,poor
it's an okay app,poor
its too complex,poor
can't do anything unless you buy the pro version,poor
Very confusing,poor
not work in my tab Lenovo yoga 3 bed experience 😑😒😞,poor
why you changed layout to old one..its really bad and annoying.,poor
sir i already did all step but i still face notification ringing problem.,poor
Hard to understand setup. Could not schedule tasks to weekdays. Does not even show a calendar .,poor
bakwas app,poor
"I'd like to give it a 5 star, VERY MUCH. The app is very useful, convenient and easy to use and what's even better is that it allows the user to modify the alarm (sound, icon, etc) as we please that makes it much easier to organize our schedule. But the app no longer works after i've changed my phone, i don't know if the issue is about my phone (i used Mi A1 before and oppo currently) or the app. I've read about the configuration to get the app back to work but to no avail, please help. Ty",poor
can I get a refund,poor
worst app,poor
bhai very very very very bad asp,poor
not user friendly,poor
"""removed support for google drive backups""",poor
"i hated that you cannot edit certain things. For example when you go to make a schedule there's no option to delete blank slots, no obvious anyway.",poor
"not very user friendly, atleast for me. the alarm doesnt ring it on only vibrates. i have to put every thing manually, like if its 11 am in the clock it gives me optionts what i m going to do from 12 pm. and even after using it for a week i am not clear how dis format gonna helm me",poor
"wont synch to calendar, have to buy pro version",poor
bruh I literally have no clue how this app works,poor
"this app isn't optimized for use, it's just a concept. for example, the alarm plays music but can't be shut off. there's no ""acknowledge alarm"" so if it starts paying music... yeah it never stops. this is only one of many bugs so bad it breaks the app. don't waste your time.",poor
bogus app. update isnt working. i was using the same app in past in the same device it was working properly. now i hv updated and its not giving any notification and even status bar is showing the past activities not current.,poor
hate itt,poor
not working in my phone,poor
"Very disappointed about the recent update, I had everything work fine till the update scrambled everything.",poor
not what I wanted. wanted a timeline.,poor
"The idea is great, and I would have loved this. However I WILL NOT pay to be able to use different routines for different days. This app is nothing more than a way for them to trap you into payment. Don't bother with this one.",poor
"Programmer does nog work properly. It is changing times and dates on his own. Instead of saving time it is costing me time (and money for the pro version). I ran into this problem a few days after my purchase so i'm not able to get a refund while the app is unreliable, so practically unusuable.",poor
Can't buy pro version on note 9? Apparently in app billing is not available on my device? Guess I can't give you my money...,poor
"Bought the pro version, amount got deducted and programer version became accessible. But after sometime its showing that i have to buy the pro version again. Kindly troubleshoot this problem.",poor
has something wrong it takes the routine i created for one day and do it for all days,poor
"there is no time table,this app is fake!",poor
bad experience,poor
how to use this? help me please,poor
I found it odd that the app didn't have preset hourly reminders. Most people have habits that require them to do them on specific hours (for example; gyming twice or thrice a day) the app should have a feature on where you can input the exact times in the day when it should remind you Another example of this would be:  Reminder: on every Thursdays at 7am and 8pm I should be reminded of (insert habit).  Instead it's jungle of toggles that seem to not make sense,poor
very bad,poor
great,poor
"Wow, from 5 stars to one. You guys ruined your perfect scheduling app. WHY!?! The new Routines layout is inefficient and has several flaws. Can't use it at all if trying to plan my routine makes me want to throw my phone against a wall. Please bring back the old Routines format ASAP.",poor
incoherent jumble,poor
"what is the use of this app if it can not show notification with sound, also can not alert me when i m buzy in others chaos.",poor
Interface is not really satisfactory,poor
i have bad experience,poor
complicated,poor
Please tell me how to use the app,poor
some thing is comming in front if screen and interepting. app is not runs in notification bar,poor
Hi have been looking for a app which remind me each and every hour because I'm a student and I need a that kind of app but in your application this feature is not available... 😒😒😔,poor
"I missed my work today because of your stupid ""weak alarm"" method. This means I've lost some money. Notification reliability should be of paramount importance. If something doesn't work 100%, remove it. Very disappointed. VERY! Edit: I didn't get any warning, nothing. If the other option is the recommended one (which I hate that it adds an alarm icon in the status bar. other apps work without doing this), it doesn't mean the other one IS NOT WORKING. Bad. I'm forced to use the stock alarm for the first event in the morning to be sure, which is very inconvenient",poor
Waste app.,poor
I did not understand,poor
This app is to complicated,poor
Why this app requires so much of settings in one time.. 1)Like it should be in recent apps..2) If internet is off it doesn't works..3) Even though all the permissions to app is allowed in phone settings.. Than to it crashes.. It requires an immediate update with all the bugs fixed soon. Or people wouldn't even write a review.. They would uninstall the app and find better alternatives.,poor
Worst app,poor
"It will ruin your plan, you are going to waste your time customizing it. Downloading this app will increase your screen time and degrade your efficiency.",poor
Most of the things are paid,poor
The new version is so complicated loved the old one it was simple and easy and quick to use it was perfect,poor
I donk like this app anymore,poor
I've bought the pro version and after a week it disappeared. disappointing,poor
"The widget doesn't work, it appears only few minutes and then it disappears so I need to add ot manually again",poor
"Free options are hard to find and bundled with pro version, can't open free without ad for pro version literally clicked one thing after opening your app for the first time and it instantly went to a pop up of the pro version, I'm not going to navigate your app to find only the free options that are given to me bundled in with the pro versions when there are other apps that are available that never mention pro version which I downloaded",poor
"This app started out great. Everything was so organized and I was happy I had a digital schedule with reminders to carry with me. But it stopped giving me notifications, it also stopped showing my reminders all together. I wanted to uninstall the app for a while because it's never working, but today was the last straw. I had a reminder put for my midterm, but of course since it's such an awful app... it didn't notify me. I missed my midterm. Screw this app, don't download it.",poor
Impossible to use.,poor
Not worth it don't buy...,poor
Totally joke.,poor
I have not installed it...not sure if it was somehow installed by hacking,poor
lose my time :(,poor
How to restore my pro version?,poor
I HATE IT ITS CONFUSING,poor
Play tune does not work on gionee,poor
The most trash app i have ever seen.,poor
Its most timewasting app instead! I downloaded this for schedule n it asks to buy a pro version for it! It should be mentioned first before we dwnld this app!,poor
Don't know how to use it because many icon were showing to upgrade to new version popups.,poor
It's notification tune is frequency low,poor
Stupid,poor
Changes the time of routine when adding new ones? Completely useless,poor
U should give a shor git tutorial that how to use it. U should also add some random time tables also. Its not a good app,poor
Sab kuch khud se hi karna pad raha h...,poor
"Well, The app interface itself is quite confusing. The interface should be more simple & easy to understand.",poor
"Pretty good, notifications don't work however.",poor
In Redmi phone app not working.. please solve this issue,poor
Not user friendly,poor
"Redesigned dialogs are broken: 1) ""Import day from"" dialog on routine edit screen – no ""Monday"" & ""Tuesday"" in the day list (spinner) 2) ""+ Notification"" dialog on routine edit screen – no ""Play voice"" checkbox (Please tell me if there's a better way to report bugs like this)",poor
Why is break tag forcefully added in all activities? Why can't I remove it? Why deleting tags delete the whole activity? Edit - I don't think you quite understood the problem. I cannot change or remove the 'break' tag. Even in work activities it forces the break tag and I cannot replace it. Plus if an activity has 3 tags and one of them gets removed doesn't mean you'll remove the whole activity.,poor
Felt complicated app to set up,poor
"This app is really good for people, especially students who are busy with their schedules.. However since the last update in Feb 2020. I can't make new schedule. The 'OK' or 'DONE' button was gone.",poor
The app is always blocked by the system even I allow all the permission of this app. I cant hear or see any notifications even I fixed all the settings both of the app and my phone,poor
I am too much confuse to use this app kindly help me please,poor
Latest update sucks.,poor
"Great app but the notification ringtone doesn't work, which is really important for me. Hope you add a calendar feature for the week at least.",poor
Crashes at start.,poor
"I installed and then uninstalled it. Unless I am mistaken, there is no way to edit day-by-day deviations from a routine. So I can set up a routine, but then have no way to track how well I followed it, day by day (for instance, exercised for half an hour instead of an hour, or started late, or missed it completely, or did things out of order). Am I missing something?",poor
Not so usefull,poor
"Very good app, but it would be perfect if the app actually didn't shut down and not give me notifications. PLEASE FIX THIS",poor
Not working notification.,poor
Doesn't able to back up on Google drive,poor
It's hard to understand how it works,poor
It was okay could be better,poor
It's kinda bad sorry,poor
"You must plan in resuming the reminder tab. It's really important. By the way, I'm a paid user.",poor
This app is being killed in the background whatever i do. I have given all the permissions. But still it is being killed. My phone is oppo A5. Please do something Devs.,poor
"What I didn't know I was looking for. Hate planning my day on the calendar, and tried to use 90 different to-do lists to schedule my day. Update : their new change combining calendar events with reminders doesn't work for me. I only use this for talking reminders no scheduling",poor
"I came back to this app a go three times over the last 2 years because I really wanted it to work. Each time I tried, I spent a couple of hours trying to navigate around the features and failed to get anything out of it. Incredibly unintuitive, no in app explanation, and the online ""getting started page"" doesn't explain much on what each features do. Edit: Thank you developer for the reply, it shows that you care. I wish you all the best in making the improvements, the idea behind the app is honestly good.",poor
"My phone keeps blocking the apps action no matter what I do. It keep showing it was blocked, troubleshoot, and refresh background task.",poor
I like the way it's present itself but advantage if your not getting any notification ring ......in the system I allowed everything I needed too but still it's not working out,poor
Useless without pro.,poor
Reminders should not be transfered in event section. It was better before to figure out events and remiders separatly.,poor
How to use this app? 🤔 Very bad experience. Please simplify the process. Nobody wants to take a extra tutorials to use your app to plan our day.,poor
"I would love this app only if the notifications work at all. There were no alarms or notifications or pop ups showing in my Oppo F5. I tried tinkering with the system like what was said in the troubleshooting page so may times, yet nothing worked. Would give 5 if I do not have this issue.",poor
"Fair enough for ads but now the widget isn't showing anything anymore, it's just blank. I've set up all events and schedule and it's still blank.",poor
"I've only just started using it and can already tell it has potential. It has a simple UI but very confusing features with next to no instruction on how the features work. I purchased the premium version with the hopes to organise my routines to suit my shift work. But I can't find a way to automatically alternate my routine cycles (if it's even possible), starting the following routine cycle when the previous ends",poor
"im sure the app is nice, but i cannot add a routine, or any activity, nor i can delete anything?",poor
It's just okay.,poor
Would agree that it isnt very user friendly. Functions seem complicated and too basic at the same time,poor
"Please update the app, i want to use the app, but After a day ,alarm is not ringing , i think this app have too much bugs and problems",poor
This tune can make alarm? I set a few alarm is not ringing..,poor
"This app is really very good, but notifications aren't working. I tried everything it told me to do but it's still not working.",poor
Im still getting accustomed i like the simplicity,poor
"Limited unless you buy the full version. I spent time looking around trying to work with the app. A lot of things I tried wanted me to upgrade, which is why I found another.... I feel my review is fair. Sorry.",poor
Useless and time consuming. Got pro version but no option for refund,poor
Has potential but made no sense I didn't know what the hell I was doing needs more explanation and help,poor
App cannot keep track of an atypical. Everytime I set the day one it just resets after day 5 back to day one. instead of skipping two days and then 2 day 1 like a normal week would work. I'm deleting this app for sure.,poor
Too confusing,poor
"Great at first but now it's getting on my nerves. I tried to create a routine for each day of the week. Today is Monday, and for some reason, my Monday routine shows up for tomorrow, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. I've had daily routines show up on other days over the past week as well. There seems to be a setting where I can change this, but that doesn't seem to do the trick. It shouldn't be this hard to have one daily routine for each day of the week. Uninstalled.",poor
"So it's good. I payed for pro but the issue I'm having is adding my routine to my timeline because whenever I try and add it, it takes me to edit my routine. It's really annoying because I'd like my routine in one clean place. If this is fixed I'd definitely rate it 4 stars",poor
Worst,poor
"I was trying out the routine trick. I set the times and dates, but it just wouldn't work. Please help.",poor
"App is good but the programmer feature is bad. I have created multiple small routines which i want to enable from programmer based on my work meetings for different days. So if I have late meetings on Wed and Fri, I want to enable a separate set of routines for these days. Similarly for weekends. The programmer is allowing for just dates which is not the feature that I bought the pro version for. I want small, reusable routines that I can configure from programmer for days not periods of dates.",poor
I didn't know how to do anything..,poor
how to do so the link is not opening only,poor
Nothing special. just a calendar app. not worth the time it takes to set up. clunky at best. poor layout. minimal instructions. not intuitive to use,poor
"Not very easy to use. You can figure it out after you play with it long enough, but over all, not very intuitive.",poor
I'm so confused and frustrated trying to figure this app out.,poor
Good,poor
i got no notification,poor
Annoying to set up. You'd think it would be easy to have the exact same same schedule just 30 min later.,poor
"(edit) Been using it for a while occasionally and every time it feels like a hassle to find what I need to reach within the app.. I only use the routines, no events or reminders, I have a separate app for that, Google Assistant wit a calendar. To add a change to one day it requires a lot of clicking to amend it.. I end up writing down the rest of the day tasks on paper, deleting, amending the times and adding them manually with the new times.. That's counterproductive. I need an easy way to move",poor
osm app but now its update an I am not able to see my all reminders that I use to remind my self before uninstalling the app,poor
"Beneficial to get my goal. It's heplful to make discipline and commitments to yourself,it's continually popping up notification that what you have decided according to your time table, over all its Good and helpful for students..!!",poor
"Very bad app. I organised all of my activities, took me 1 hour to complete my planner, then realised that the app automatically sets the time at am, so all my afternoon activities where at the morning, for example if I had to eat at 1pm it said that I had to eat at 1am, so I changed them to pm and suddenly the app errased my whole schedule. WASTING 1 HOUR",poor
calendar sync for a productivity app is a pro only feature,poor
useless I dont want to purchase the app as this free version offers no good features.. the paid app might be better..Rating 2 just because of the feedback on user review.,poor
"The minimum timer is 5 mins so useless for me. I had hoped to use this as an exercise timer (I need alternating time countdowns running consecutively e.g. 3m/30s, 3m/1m, 5m/1m) plus a reminder for when my favorite combat sports are on TV. I'll keep looking.",poor
okayish,poor
you basically can't do anything if you don't buy the full version.,poor
the free version is pretty minimal.,poor
statistical data for daily routine and check marks for completed or missed routines are expected,poor
good not bad,poor
EDIT: Even just an option for the horizontal interface would be great! Thank you for taking my review into consideration! Please please please! Bring back the old horizontal interface. Or at least have an option for it. I used to absolutely love this app and would have rated it 5 stars anyday. But now I find it quite useless.. I understand how it could work for some people but it's definitely not working for everyone (as I've seen in other reviews).,poor
cant move the tasks up or down,poor
If u want to study you need to plan DON'T USE APPS,poor
there ia no way to go back to the routine old interface? new is ugly,poor
"Clunky, complicated, and confusing. Not streamlined. Ugly color choice for non pro. Just a disappointment.",poor
how to use bakwas i am vrry an gry,poor
"I would give this app 5 stars, but if you press ""silence notifications,"" you can never turn them back on.",poor
good,poor
"I've spent hours on it already and I'm just not getting it. Looks like most tutorials are for an older version. Can't figure out how to create shorter than 7 day Routines, what's the difference between a Routine and an Event, etc.",poor
i had added a routine & by default it took a date almost 8 days ahead from today's date... i m unable to change the date... it's frustrating...,poor
Really weird formatting? I'm trying to be MORE organized not get a brain workout trying to figure out an app,poor
"Wasn't sure to begin with, as it's not all that user friendly... but how frustrating to take a chance anyway & pay for premium only to have it NOT sync with my Calendars....! Wasn't really any other reason to pay for premium except that.... What a small waste of money; it's of no use to me now! 😒",poor
Don't like the new changes.,poor
Everything I wanted it for I had to do the pro mode,poor
"Android keep blocking the app from sending notifications, I've re-downloaded it and put an exception for it in the battery settings to work without interruption but nothing happens ! FIX IT.",poor
"The new interface is cluttered and hard to use. Edited, in response to the query below.  In the older interface, a routine had a separate page for each day of the week. Now it's a continuous scroll. The older approach seems cleaner.",poor
"I've been trying to figure out how to have a custom time set for the ""add notification"" options, and there doesn't seem to be any way. For example, I need to set it to 1 hour and 30 minutes, but there's no option for that. We need the ability to enter exactly the number of minutes and hours we want, instead of only having presets.  EDIT: Now after using it for a while, the app has been plagued with reliability issues. It often is late with the notification by a few minutes, or the service completely stops and I'd have to restart the service. Due to this issue, I cannot rely on this app for anything that is time-sensitive because I'd end up being late for all my appointments and jobs. I've contacted the developer multiple times about this but so far they haven't been able to fix the issue.",poor
The most recent update just made it harder to move times around.,poor
"It is better if don't have Buy pro version, hoping an app free offline soon .",poor
"I was recommended this app by a friend who loves it. I got the premium version as I expected it to have better features. This app is very confusing to use. I even went to the ""help"" section and was even more confused. I'm very disappointed",poor
"It is a good idea, but it's not really easy to use.. in fact it's quite complicated :/ I bought premium because they advertised I could set schedules per day, and I can, but not how I had hoped. I recommend to make it simpler by allowing the user to toggle days per schedule in the routine editor, and additionally make any small changes in each individual day.",poor
Routines don't last forever any more,poor
Genuinely not a good app.,poor
Nice,poor
"While it certainly wasn't expensive, it was a waste of money in the fact 
that I found this app to do very little more than any calendar. After 
reading the FAQ, it says it's more than a calendar... How? Especially since 
adding anything is done in the same way you create a calendar event. The 
""routine"" function is a missed opportunity in that I think it will help me 
establish a morning routine for myself but in reality it's about creating 
calendar events that repeat, a slightly expanded component of any free 
calendar our there. When I think of ""tuning my time spent"" I'm thinking, 
better organization for smaller tasks. Then find myself spending an hour 
setting 1 minute events for myself that I was never actually notified about 
lol what irony. Unfortunately it was not time, or money, well spent.",poor
"U should work on the phones like oppo and others so that customer don't 
find problem",poor
"Play voice option does not work consistently. It regularly does not sound 
the vocal reminder. This is a function I rely on. How do I contact you to 
discuss further?",poor
"Pro version doesn't work correctly. I have more than one google account. 
App keeps ignoring account used for purchase and using other account. I 
have to delete gmail accounts for the app to recognize the account used for 
purchase and if I try to add the deleted accounts back the app starts to 
ignore the account used for purchase.",poor
not so easy. Perhaps Pro version may b good. uninstall.,poor
"I really liked the app, helped me a lot with managing my time efficiently 
to get the most out of my day, but since I updated it it started acting up, 
it use to be so easy to simply move routine blocks around and now it's 
setting it's own times or plainly refusing to be moved to a later time 
block, which is infuriating. And the app also slowed down considerably 
after the update.",poor
"A core function missing is the ability to disable a routine/ daily 
occurrence for a specific day. For example, I usually exercise from 6pm to 
8pm every day, so I created an event that happens every Monday to Friday. 
Today is a Thursday and due to an unexpected occurrence, I can't exercise 
today. I wanted to change that my 6-8pm block of time just today, but can 
only do so by deleting the event for EVERY Monday to Thursday to clear my 
timeline. Makes no sense to clear that block of time and need to re-create 
that exercise block for all the other Monday to Fridays. If something 
unexpected happens at 6pm next Friday, I'll have to delete it ALLL, and 
recreate all over again after just to clear my timeline. If you get this 
core feature right, then the app would be complete.",poor
It's too confusing.,poor
Not sure,poor
Lots of In-app purchases ... Not worth the time .,poor
Alarm not working .. so no time strict,poor
It is not what I want,poor
It's confusing,poor
"Tried to plan my weekly schedule with the ""routines"" function, but it kept randomly changing the times of the events as I made other edits. (For example, an event I set for 4pm changed to 11am when I hit the button ""add break before event""). Also annoying that you can't preview the notification sounds, and have to add silly tags to each event such as ""housework"".",poor
You have to buy pro version,poor
Купил версию Pro. Сменился телефон. Что покупать снова? Тогда зачем такое приложение?,poor
The new widget is not looking good. Please bring back the old widget or atleast bring an option to make it look like the older version.,poor
So far I like it I thought there would be an option to sync your routine from the Google calendar but apparently you can only sync the timeline. The time tune staff has been very helpful and the app has alot of potential!,poor
"This app is a good idea and I like the fact that it is very good to start healthy habits an get organized but yet, I could not do anything even with the little tutorial at the beginning.  THIS APP WAS NO HELP TO ME ALL I RECOMMEND IS THAT THE APP HAS TO BE A BIT MORE SELF-EXPLANATORY I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO DO ANYTHING!!!!!!!!",poor
"I regret buying this app. (TL;DR: don't use this app if you ever intend on changing routines or planning.) Changing existing routines is very hard as it simply deletes whatever overlaps in time. So unnecessary and impossible to revert. If you accidentally click PM instead of AM once, your whole day is deleted permanently. Also, every time I want to sync between my phone and my tablet I have to export it to Google Drive and then import it from the other device. Also, you can't copy items or days to another time. Please make this app more user friendly!",poor
Everything is under pro version.,poor
Reminder didnt work on Vivo,poor
"Tried it out. The time function, which is 90% of the app IMHO, is clunky. The default ""end"" time is ""until next activity"", but then it automatically changes to the start time of the next activity and you can't change it back. Then, if you add a task that overlaps other start times, it deletes the other activities. I spent 15 minutes setting up a schedule and was frustrated to find that I had erased my entire afternoon schedule because I made a mistake when changing the end time of something mid-day. This app was, for me, ironically, a waste of time.",poor
I don't get a single notification... The calendar doesn't work well..,poor
Stupid,poor
"At first this app worked well, then the next day this app stopped notifying my next activities. It stucked on the last activity before the next day",poor
Stopped working after a week,poor
"after recent update notifications messed up. sometimes i can't turn it off, so it rings until you reset the device",poor
Idk how it works,poor
Timer don't follow exact minutes. In case of 5min reminder it takes about 6/7 minutes to notify. Painful,poor
"In timeline section, I cannot see the upcominh events (I can only see the events for today and next day), and that kills the purpose of the time table apps. People need to see the upcoming event, in order to schedule nrw events, so they wont overlap with each other. Keep up the good work, and this will be a good app😎",poor
Confusing to use eventhough me being an IT professional for 12 years. Always forces you to buy pro version. Better apps are out there for weekly planning.,poor
Have to refresh timeline manually,poor
Nothing special,poor

"I want to create a regular schedule and be able to amend times for regular activities on the occasional week.  Unfortunately, when you amend the time once it changes your schedule completely.  EDIT - I appreciate the response and looked at the guide.   I don't want to have to create a whole new bespoke routine day if I am just amending the timing of one event.  Unfortunately, this is not flexible enough as this won't save me any time.",poor
"I like the app, but you can't tick thing's off. I like to go through my tasks and tick each one off as I do it. Then I feel I am accomplishing something,  I feel I am  getting somewhere. If it had that, it would be brilliant.",poor
Very bad,poor
Essential app I have ever Installed... BUT I couldn't set customised ringtone for notifications... Why?,poor
I work in a school and the schedule has times like 4:42 which this app doesnt do. Like it but absolutely useless to me.,poor
Best,poor
BAD!!!!👎👎👎,poor
The application cleaned up all information I was adding for few days. Really disappointed that I wasted my time it. The application is not  tested properly if it has such a major bugs.,poor
"You have to pay for some advanced thing, you have a limited space to type stuff in for reminders. Just not for me",poor
This app isn't very good. It's laggy and you need pro to do any important stuff,poor
Calender sync should be free,poor
Not intuitive for my use. Seems like you have to create routines rather than just simply track activities.,poor
"This app is ok but i don't understand why i cannot see the whole month, or a graph showing what amount off time i spent doing individual activities.   I spent a little while tagging and creating different routines. You won't be able to merge multiple routines. It will delete the first thing you merged or any activity you added.  If this doesn't improve you might as well use Google apps instead. There is nothing too special about this app. I regret paying for it.",poor
"Very confusing, I couldn't even set a daily reminder.  Edit: to have a daily reminder, I need to create a routine, set number of days (whatever that means) to 1, open it, add an activity, create a new tag for it (cause I can't just give it a simple name), then go back and enable the routine. That's EXTREMELY confusing as for a simple thing like this. Don't want to do this again.",poor
Didn't notify me when I had to do things,poor
"Nice, but crashing",poor
"Confusing. I feel I can't really plan my tasks and things for the day. I don't like how I cant name an activity and only have vague tags. To me this app is more like a record rather than an actual planner. Use it to see where your time goes but if you wanted to actually plan your day it is not good for that.  Update: thanks for the response, I look forward to seeing future updates.",poor
very complicated for normal use..,poor
The app worked perfectly for FIRST reminder and then no alarm ringing thereafter Lenovo A2020a,poor
hello sir i am using ur app app design is goot no dought but i am facing an issue when i set an reminder i wont pop up on tim. just dont do anything remains same but routine remind me on time please tell me the solution so that i can use reminder as well,poor
"Notifications/Alarms dont make any noise or appear on the phone, no matter how I modify the settings.",poor
"I loved this app until my phone crashed and I had to restore my data from the Google drive backup. I had set my daily backup for both local and google drive, but the backup wasn't up to date and I have lost all the changes I made on my phone before it crashed. Really disappointed",poor
I have been searching for months for a schedule / planner that uses a continuous alarm until I switch it off myself. Yours is actually great and I would rate it at least a 4 IF the alarm worked properly. The old Nokia I used some time ago had a built-in app that did the job properly.,poor
"The notifications don't work, so doesn't actually help with my time keeping skills, actually missed a few things I needed to do today as I was relying on the notifications to remind  me.",poor
"Tried to set up routines, but editing tasks is too finicky. Tasks I just entered disappeared for some reason.",poor
Whenever I open the app it is not reflected current routine. Everytime I need to refresh it.,poor
No test period of all options.,poor
"This scheduler is severely lacking basic and simple features.  The reminder function needs to give the user the option to select specific and multiple days of the week and dates he or she wants the reminder to repeat itself. Daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly aren't good enough. I want certain reminders to only be for weekdays, weekends, and e.g. Mondays and Saturdays.  The reminder function needs to be able to repeat itself multiple times in a day. When certain events are coming up, I want to be reminded 24 hours, 1 hour, and 5 minutes before to the event.  The reminder function also needs an option to decide the duration of the sound and vibration. I'm sometimes not close to to my phone, and might miss the reminder when it only rings for a few seconds, or even a few minutes. And make it so that you can also set the time with the keypad, not only by turning the clock arms around.",poor
Can't do anything unless I pay. Not worth paying for.,poor
"I don't know if the pro app has a one off timer but that is the problem I have at the moment, else this would be the only one I use. There is another very simple interval timer that I like but having them separately is nice unless I can set something like that up to trigger within my schedule. This is one of my favorite apps but I two started so this might be seen. I am having a little trouble buying the pro version since another account has my trusted funds.",poor
Good,poor
I do not get alaram please help me,poor
"You can't see your whole week schedule on just one page, so if you wanted to schedule something with someone, you have to flip through each single day. Also when you create specific events, they aren't incorporated into your routine for a single period/cycle. They are two separate things. So you may get a notification about it beforehand, but when you look through your weeks schedule it doesnt show up there. It's great for routines, but doesn't incorpotate events into your week which is hard for scheduling.",poor
Alarm and notification did not work,poor
"When I wanna change the ringtone for Remembering , it changes it back to its default ... It would be good if it dint .",poor
"useless.. it does not sound an alarm,! it just vibrate 3 times ,,, it wont notify me ..  please make it sound an alarm",poor
"Good idea but needs work. I don't like the fact that it will not let you create to routine events at the same time. For example. If I add a routine event named alone time and I said it from 3 pm to 5 pm and then I create another routine event from 3 p.m. to 3:15 and I named it ""having a meal"" it will override it will not create it.  That needs to be fixed",poor
I have set a sound with the notifications but it does not work,poor
Love it,poor

"Only an orange spreadsheet that makes this calculation: time_length*number_of_days. It doesnt really track your de facto time spending. It doesnt help anything for schedulling study, for example.",poor
It works fine and has no other issues but the notification doesnt work..i have tried several times and it doesnt notify me when the tag switches...i checked my notification settings too...sometimes i get the notification and sometimes not..so probably there is nothing to do with the device settings.,poor
So we can try it before we buy it in the first version!,poor
Do not get notification sound.,poor
"Notification sound not working, it didn't alarm.",poor
Helps a lot to manage my hectic schedule try it,poor
Can't use application because the advertisements cover the buttons.,poor
The alert doesn't work😭😭,poor
Its nice and easy to use...but it always stop at one time and not continuing the schedule...and no notifications eventhough i set for notifications .The worse part is that the schedule is not continuing and i have to log in into the apps to continue the schedule...whats going on....pls fix it....thx...,poor
"Great time organizer but...  There should be an option to check off completed tasks.  And there has to be more pro benefits.  Just bought the pro version and then realised that with all the new updates you ""liberate the pro option to all users"".  I wouldnt have paid that much money if I knew it was only for removing ads.",poor
"When I first installed the app, it worked well. However, recently I started getting notifications at incorrect times (out by several hours). I have not changed anything since I set it up a few months ago. This app is pretty much useless now.",poor

Too complicated,poor
It's all just boring,poor
good,poor

"The app itself is fantastic. The fact it doesn't seem to sync with anything,  I don't understand. Am I missing something?",poor
Unintuitive and restrictive,poor
Loved it,poor
"The options you have are stupid. When I tried to set up notifications the ""Save"" function does not work.",poor
Nice,poor
"Why constant ads, for such a simple app?",poor
"Like your logo, you should improve your app's UI so it becomes more attractive... nice app... improve UI and i'll download it again and give 5 stars... :)",poor

Needs fixing,poor

"Its a great app , but i do have a very useful suggestion. Could u also add like a streak maintainer in the routines . Like if i create and enable a weekly routine so everytime i follow the routine honestly i will have a one day streak and so on. It will be quite movtivational for everyone.",neutral
"Hey there, lots of compulsory improvements needed ASAP like check boxes, short note or comment on routine and many more. Suppose my class which was on routine got cancelled and I want to delete it from my schedule... I can't do it. It still get counted in my day summary.

It's a really great app and I love it! but for some reason since last week it's not opening and working well..... It shows troubleshooting problems but when I check nothing is there. Also I have given all permissions but still I have to refresh every 3-4 hours to get notifications. Please check it!! Otherwise it's great!!!!,neutral
"PRO: Simple - use routines to schedule your week and it will repeat. Set it and forget, it will remind you. CON: Barebones - that's all it does. Using programing or blocks is more time consuming than it's worth. Feedback - make blocks a drag and drop icon that can be ""programmed"" into your regular schedule, at a whim. (Eliminate the need to specify a time and date, instead give the option for a duration e.g. workout 1 hour.)",neutral
It's fairly good. I'm mainly posting this review to suggest that timetune pro be a monthly subscription of a dollar. Some people might not go for that but in reality it would help the developers to be better funded so they could make the app the best of its kind. Is timetune the best? no. Its potential is incredible though and I really like the approach and Design.,neutral
Good app. Very nice. But is confusing. I do not understand anything. But no problem. I will learn. Then this is a good app.,neutral
"The UI looks good but can be confusing. The different labels (programmer, etc.) don't make much sense in the context of the app. You can't check an item as 'done', and if something in your day changes and you need to adjust or reorder your routine for one day, you can't, which makes the app a bit useless.",neutral
"ads are ok, but not sliding or moving ones ... they are distracting me right off the bat while i am just starting to check the app out ... gotta move on",neutral
"Even though the app size is small, it serves it purpose well other than apps made for routine management.UI can be improved. Also the pro version button in the bottom is kinda annoying.But overall, it's a really well made app!",neutral
The problem is the phone is not ringing even though Ring is turned on. Output is given Alarm Volume. Yet Its not ringing..,neutral
This app is nice but I put notifications and it don't give me notifications so my dismissed So please improve this problem,neutral
It's good..,neutral
While I like the app before I don't like the tags thing. I wish that was just something you could shut off. I don't like that I have to set up a tag just to put something in the schedule.,neutral
Its okay,neutral
Better app But app do not play sound but give a single notification no alarm(song which I chose to play do not worked) Can you help me with that please .....,neutral
It's really nice.... although I would like to see an option for subtasks....Pls update,neutral
"I really wish it was possible to see an entire month or maybe just a week at a time, instead of only 1 day at a time. You could click on a date to go back to only seeking 1 date at a time, but it should be possible to have an overview of your week. It's honestly huge problem and it could boost my rating from 3 to 5 stars if they make this an option.",neutral
I have not used it right now I will download it and sharing my experience if this has changed my life or not,neutral
Really disappointed with new update. The widget look really bad after the update. Please change it. The annoying thing is the length of the colour tab in the widget alter according to the writing in the tab. There is no uniformity. Its look weird now 😕,neutral
"Used to like this app, even if wasn't the smoothest. Some remarks about the new update: 1️⃣ Removed colors. I had a color-coding scheme and now it's all gone. Will they do the same in a few months when I have a tag system? 2️⃣ UI is sleeker, but still has amateurish mistakes. Eg. tags are more prominent than task name in Schedule view! 3️⃣ Adding an event when I'm in Schedule takes me to Events/Blocks page, which means I have to tap Schedule and scroll back to where I was when adding multiple.",neutral
"Am a timetune paid user , been using for more than a month. This looks like another User Interface for just reminders. Nothing more than this . An average application",neutral
"It's a good app for scheduling your day although it's not great and have room for improvement. I do not know exactly what, as I am not an expert, but it feels that way. One thing that it should incorporate right away is the possibility of archiving Routines and Tags (not only keep or delete). I will rate 4 stars if they add this feature and 5 stars if they manage to make it a GREAT app for time scheduling.",neutral
"There's nothing special about this application, it works as any built-in calendar application. You can make schedule manually or you can add entries manually.",neutral
it is a good app i must say !!but it doesn't work properly for this reason i had uninstalled it!!,neutral
Didn't make any sense to me. I started using this app and attempted to make a sceduale but couldn't figure it out.,neutral
I don't know how to use it .. Help me please 🙏🏻,neutral
It works best till 5 to 6 hours but after a time that didn't stop ringing it is showing that your sittings block the time toon application it rings and rings till I uninstall this application..,neutral
"It's OK...but NOT free really! Costs 5 bucks to get basoc fratures on/annouying ads off. I don't feel like investing in something that in the end may or may not work out, while there are many systems that could easily replace this app. The 'routines' can be easily called 'recurring tasks' and that feature is offered by almost every respectable calendar app. Free 60 trial period would encourage me, but sneaking in payment under the label of 'free' app is what annoys me on principle! Don't do it!",neutral
"Wonderful, but please give total version in less amount of price",neutral
"Awesome. I upgraded to support 2 requests to get 5stars. 1) i need a move back option,if my 12 oclock runs late i need to push all the other tasks that day back by x minutes. 2) option to automatic cloud backup OR sync data from timetune to calendar",neutral
I love the layout and different features. Two things that I would love changed or added are: 1. The ability to either edit a routine for a singular day or to clear a routine from a singular day (like when I have an atypical day and can't follow my regular routine); and 2. The ability to see the overlap in events/routines if two different things occur at the same time.,neutral
"Nice looking app with good user interface. The ability to check off daily tasks, add goals with subtasks & note taking capability would be perfect.",neutral
"Used to work really well, now the notifications wont work on my xiaomi phone, rendering ot pretty much useless..and I tried everything",neutral
Its good,neutral
Seems ok atm but I can't tune the alarm off when a task pops up,neutral
"I like it, just try it.",neutral
"Nice,💥😊",neutral
It's kinda cool but the alarm icon disappear immediately the app is closed and therefore do not show notification when the time set is due.,neutral
I like the concept but the app itself is confusing to navigate and set up and is not very user-friendly.,neutral
"Really great app ! Giving three star only because having problem to make routines! After adding five or six activities, it stops working. Can't add anymore ! Please notify me after fixing the issue.",neutral
It's voice is very slow it must be louad !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please fixed it,neutral
The sound of reminder is very low,neutral
Love the routine schedule I help you to create. I'm horrible at establishing routines & sticking to them so I need help like this.,neutral
"This is a good app. It has background issues, I have refresh to make it notifications work",neutral
"I don't like that it forgets the settings (like repeat, daily, no notification, etc) so you have to change it every time. Also, no way to stop the vibration when selecting certain things. Also, when you add a new event, the date gets to the next day and after it says that you can only input less than 24 hours. Bottom line: good idea, finicky to use.",neutral
Ok,neutral
Please improve the persistent notification. When I close the app it get removed it should be there for all time.,neutral
Good app,neutral
"Great idea, such a usefully app. We did have the ability to sync with our calendar. The widgets were super cute and looked amazing on my phone. However the alarm system isn't the best. I would have troubles switching it off because it wasn't in the notification bar and there was no popup for me to turn it off. If have to switch off my phone which was really irritating. Thank you.",neutral
"Works okay if you're looking for routine alarm, but not exactly as a motivation and control of routines.",neutral
"The alarms set, are not going off when they're supposed to....",neutral
"I liked this app in its previous form, but they have been reducing options. One of my favorite thing was the repeat by minutes option. It's gone.",neutral
I have tried various time organizing apps and this one is best till now.,neutral
"A really good app but since the new update the interface look so bad, was so much cuter and clean before now it's weird",neutral
I'm still trying it out but so far it has helped a lot. One would not waste time if they have this app in hand.,neutral
"This is a decent time managment app. The ability to create routines is handy, though it doesnt warn you or show if activities are overlapping. The most recent update (as of 3/30/2020) made the app look much cleaner, which is nice. I would like to see more personalization options t'wards the look af the tags and app. Choices now are very slim. The $5 price tag for the pro version doesn't feel worth it (yes, buyer's remorse), so if you can manage fine with the free version, stick with that.",neutral
I am so confused,neutral
"Notification sound does not work now, before it does.",neutral
The app was awesome but it stopped working in a week. I'm not able to add any routine now.,neutral
It's usefull - but would be much nicer if there was an option to play a notification tone just once instead of repeating it continuously.,neutral
Hi. Thanks for responding and I'll be more specific: Please bring back the pretty orange background for the top bar and each of the routines. The current color is too pale.,neutral
"When I tried to load in my own alarm sound, it wouldn't let me.",neutral
"I was using journal but can't write much until my hand gets better so I was looking for the app to plan my day preciously by time. Thought time line of this app would work, like all the icon and pre-made taps. But disappointed that I can not use those icons by itself for my event unless you creat another ""routine"" If dev's can modify the app that makes all those taps can be added to timeline by itself with my own time not only as events or routine, that would be perfect! Thanks",neutral
I really like this app. But I stopped using it because it's too hard to type out my entire routine on the app. I wish it was windows compatible.,neutral
"Pretty good, could be better",neutral
"This is a very cool app, and thus have the ratings. How ever it will be nice if you can add the functionality of sharing task or even with other users. This will make it the all in one Project/Task manager. Review Update : Previously, I was able to pick custom tags when setting a new event, but now I can't and I have to pick a color and look for the same icon each time I want to create a new event. This is counter productive as the main aim of the app is to help optimize time. Please fix this",neutral
"Tried this app for a bit. The logic is very different from what I need, so the experience wasn't good. This app focuses on routines and is built around this concept. It was very confusing at first (because it started with abstract ideas, not what average joe is already familiar with; e.g. calendar/timeline) and the entire experience just felt awkward. For me, all I want is, see the day/week/month, add to-do items one by one, and be able to turn any of these items into routines when I want to.",neutral
Difficult to use and doesn't show name of activity only when I click on it,neutral
I like the ideas of the app. However the biggest inconvience for me is when something happens that disrupts my routines. There doesn't seem to be anyway to change the routine for one day with out changing it for every day in the futurs as well. It is annoying to have to manualy change a routine and then have to change it back the next day. I would like to see an option to edit or rearrage single intances of items in the time line without effecting the base routine or future dates.,neutral
Stupid decision to remove timer.,neutral
"It's ok but I wish I could move activities around in a routine instead of having to manually change the time one by one E.g. if I have yoga 9-10 then study 10-12 and want to swap them I can't just move around the blocks I have to delete study, change the time of yoga then add study with the new time. It's time consuming and not practical. Would also be good to be able to change settings of a routine e.g. from 4 days to 2 instead of deleting the entire routine and start over",neutral
"I sadly had to uninstall this app as tgere was no general opt-out option for direct marketing activity. I could opt out of seeing personalised ads on this app i couldnt opt of my data being collected and combined with other sources and shared by all of their many advertising partners, which for an app like this is just too invasive. Very saddened, as the app does look really good.",neutral
"I used to use this app to set intervals of when I would check in to games I was playing, but since they removed the timer feature for some reason, the scheduling stuff doesn't suit my purposes. Still, the app should be able to help you maintain a schedule just fine, but most phones have that feature built in.",neutral
Really like this app but wish I could see my WHOLE calendar or at least have the option to search for a specific date. That would make it perfect as I want to use it as my go to planner.,neutral
Good,neutral
"Manca solo una visualizzazione in prospettiva degli eventi, che faccia capire bene quanto tempo occupano",neutral
love the app... bt still some feature like temporary modification if somebody is late then adjustment is required and please add tasker integration for advance options if you can... people will ready to pay for tasker plugin support also,neutral
"My original review seems to have disappeared. I have an issue on my Galaxy Note S8 where I can't turn off the alarms without uninstalling. I received a response from support, but couldn't respond directly. Their response was simply that I should be able to swipe the notification and the sound go away. Yes, I agree, that should happen. However, that isn't what happens. There is no notification from the app for the alarm. I receive other notifications from the app. Running out of room to explain.",neutral
"Routine module and programming is nice. Any plans to make it a tracker app - log if the schedule event is accomplished completely, partially or not accomplished..? For example - drinking water few times a day. Exercising 1hr per day.",neutral
"I love the app. Great concept. But the thing is you cant use it or it wont notify you, not unless you open the app. Once you close the background it will lost.",neutral
There's a lot to be improved.. hope this app to get better with the time,neutral
"Good but very confusing It was good if I knew how to use it. The whole set up was very confusing and hard to understand, I really hope in the future it becomes simpler",neutral
"Great UI. The idea is great but need a way to mark tasks/routine item as complete. and so, we can't even know our progress. Guess the use case itself is completely different.",neutral
Good,neutral
I think the app should request permission over other apps or if possible have it as a widget. It keeps getting inactive when removed from recent files tab of the phone.,neutral
It doesn't ring or do any sign to remind me about my work,neutral
"When you start to reschedule things, the interface is very awkward moving times around. For example, moving everything forward or backward on the schedule is very un intuitive",neutral
It's really confusing! Its hadd to make routines and stuff. Just over all really confusing. But over great way to track routines. I love the tag idea. Mabey you should add a default school tag?,neutral
not enough customatization,neutral

has potential but the interface isnt user friendly at all,neutral
"This is app is perfect just need a checklist and daily, weekly and monthly tracker for each task... Had it been have all these, I would have given all 5 stars! You know sometimes we miss(or intentionally ignore) reminders and we need trackers for those for self development!",neutral

"It's really only useful if you are doing recurring tasks at the same time, on the same days, etc. I set up a lot of tags (categories) but they can only be applied to the routines, not events or reminders. I was also not able to copy/duplicate events, which would have allowed me to reuse the same tasks at different times or days without setting up a brand new event. Disappointed in the app's scheduling capabilities.",neutral
This app is great if you know how to use it... I downloaded it and it just doesn't work for me it says it's a routine app but it doesn't really let you put your whole routine it only let's you put one reminder at a time.,neutral
good great greatest very good nice decent adjusting,neutral
"It does the job I wanted, that is to ring alarm at the set time. However I am unable to clear the timeline! That is old ones. Couldn't get much help from their help center",neutral
it does not remind us so I deleted this app,neutral
not really the app that I was looking for but ok,neutral
"Not bad but not great. Pros: 3rd party calendar sync, time line view, icons & colour options to customise. Cons: can't sync devices, no task list or tick box. More options needed such as daily time line view, font size & highlight current day. Editing isn't easy & I think the whole app including widget could have a neater, tidier look. Overall it's not very intuitive, needs more options & flexibity. It has some way to go. I've got premium btw.",neutral
"While it has helped me be more productive, recently the notification settings are bugging out. When I tap on 'ADD notification', and select a louder notification (for when I wake up) and press done, I find out sooner or later than it had reset it to the ""opener"" (my default notification sound that is quiter). This has caused me great annoyance because of this and do not know why this app decided to bug out!",neutral

Some features are to be paid.,neutral
nice app,neutral
no reminder tone else 5 star,neutral
This app is useful. BUT. It would be so much more useful if you could set a routine to be repeated every weekday/ weekend day/ week/2week/4week/month/etc. It is badly in need of this feature. I thought buying pro would allow me to do this and it hasn't helped at all and I'm disappointed I spent the money. Please say that it is an upcoming feature. Resetting routines for every day is really inconvenient!,neutral
great concept,neutral
UI can be improved. More rounded corners instead of hard corners. It makes the app look more modern. (my opinion),neutral
bit complicated in adding routines.. I didn't understood,neutral
The layout for the app is awesome. But it would be better if non-routine task can be added into the timeline with the same activity for routine task.,neutral

This is so complicated it took me awhile to to figure all the stuff. I would suggest add some tutorial on YouTube so anyone can get used to it. and the app is solid and will think about purchasing the pro version.,neutral
Just tested the pro version. Needs to be more stable. Sometimes my work starts at 12 am?? And it doesn't sync with my google calendar. Widget needs to be fine tuned. Not quite satisfied so 3 stars.,neutral
i love this app so far but the notifications are not really working for me,neutral
not practical,neutral
"The app is overall good, just bought the upgraded version since I wanted to sync the google calender. I still cannot sync the Google calender into the calender and also would like to know if sync the 'routine' from timetune into the Google calender is possible? Thanks!",neutral
"Its a good way to manage your time, but after a while the timeline menu bugs out and stops sending notifications. Besides that the app is very good.",neutral
Good app!,neutral
Its good. i like the little picture icons. i wish for 2 things: that you can share as a jpg file and not a txt file to email. and that the length of the boxes represented the amount of time used. for example: snack time would be a short box. sleep would be a long box. thanks!,neutral
I love this app. I would really love an option to check off or mark that a task was complete.,neutral
"Hi, please provide accepted, pending, decline tags on rutine notifications of activites and also show day progress for these tags or activites in app. I think it will ""force the mind"" to follow daily schedule.",neutral
"I bought the pro version in hope I can organize my time to do my tasks, but the progrmer just disables the routine, that's all!!!! really?!!! the other thing I didn't like was to set a routine for a reoccurring like school or sleep I had to set it for every single day, one by one!!! you could have add a reapet feature to it. I'm not happy I wish I could get my money back!",neutral
not too bad,neutral
"Great potential, but I can't use the app to its full extent due to its counter-intuitive layout. Just filling two days in Routine view turned it into an endless scroll. Shame, the app really looked like what I was looking for. Reply: Thanks for taking my review into account. Yes, I think a horisontal orientation would be much better. Maybe leave both options? That way everyone can decide what best suits them.",neutral
"Really don't like that they changed the empty time slots back to the way they were (whenever you delete an activity the activity gets replaced with an empty block separate from the empty blocks before or after it), I find it to be extremely unnecessary. But the new feature of increasing or decreasing an activity in 1, 5 or 15 minute chunks is great, and the programmer feature works well as always, particularly good for planning out studies and work.",neutral
it is useful but not the perfect,neutral
The Concept is quite elligant yet also hard and confusing to understand. It would be eaier if there was a calendar setting and/or addition to help the user plan along with a timeline.,neutral
"this is good but, you need to update: where we can sync on our desktop or another phone via google or else.",neutral
"I like this app, but in the world of Time/Schedule Management you have to be multi-platform. I would recommend that your next step in development is a web interface as the majority of a professionals day is spent on a PC or laptop.",neutral
im sure the pro version is great but it didn't keep my interest long enough,neutral
i used to love this app..... but now it has been ruined..... made things more complicated and v can't assign according to days of week....,neutral
It does not play ring tone on my mobile.,neutral
"It's not clear how much it cost the premium account. Also, every time I try to go premium I get a message saying ""the in-app billing are not available on this device"". I've always do in-app purchasing and it was the first time that I got this issue. Really disappointed.",neutral
how to view statistics?,neutral
It's simple and easy to use but notification often doesn't work about 10 times a day.,neutral
No japanese support :(,neutral
Sometimes it stops working so you have to refresh the background tasks but it's a nice app😁,good
"If your phone isn't giving you Notifications, go to Settings, Notifications, Output Channel, and change it to Alarm. It will make a sound. TimeTune, it would be smart to make this the default setting. Vibration still not working on Samsung S10.",good
"Good app, but lacked cloud synchronization with more than one device.",good
"Please add the number of days left for events, which will be more helpful.",good
Great app.. One star cut for not being available at iOS because I also have ipad and I want it to be on that too..,good
"Hi TimeTune, I love your app since then. I just have a problem. I don't know how to fix the blockage of TimeTune app on my Infinix Hot 9. Your site for troubleshooting is not accessible for me. Overall this app is fine and satisfying. Edit. Troubleshooting doesn't work on Infinix Hot 9. Hoping for its inclusion on troubleshooting sites. Edit. I can't find any forums. I am hoping for more improvements in the future. I'll be reinstalling the app after the update.",good
"It's great but I would like to have an easier way of delaying my daily routine, sometimes I wake up 1hr late so I have to go over the tasks one by one to delay each one 1hr for example, if I could delay the hole routine at once would be much better, the same if I want to start the routine 1hr before than planned, also adding a pomodoro timer for some tasks would make this app perfect",good
"Why i cant set the clock in new activity.. There is no 'ok' button and everytime im back the clock back to 12 am, well, 'ok' button is invisible in my device",good
Best productivity app ever. Would really be useful to have a widget to display our weekly routines in a grid box. Really rooting for this. Please developer make this feature.,good
"Really enjoyed this app, but was disappointed to find it doesn't automatically sync your schedule to your account. I had to reset my phone and was bummed to see the schedule, routines, and tags I worked on for days, tweaking it to fit my kid's days perfectly was gone. Not sure I will take the time to redo it and will probably not use the app anymore although I really did like it. If you do use it, just make sure you back up your schedule!!",good
"Loves the app, super simple and easy to use. :)",good
I like this app but it's some function like reminding and posting are giggling. I can understand that it's a developing app needs improvement. Keep it up.,good
Good app...helps you keep track of your schedule well!,good
Used it app for years very good,good
"I guess it works but I am struggling to see how I can make it remind me everyday to do something and then mark it as done. Design needs improvement, not appealing and a bit confusing. It may be very useful if you find an use for it",good
"Very wonderful experience. I had plenty of difficulties trying to manage my time and the experience was totally wonderful and worthwhile, just 1 thing though add something so that on weekends it automatically switches to weekend schedule you guys could do just that . Other than that 10/10 experience",good
Still learning but so far seems to meet my needs,good
"Really good app with a major flaw You should be able to save your routines and be able to recover them in case of crash, new phone and be able to use them in other platforms with sync.",good
That's exactly ehat i need but after setting an activity it come backs to Blocks page and it's so bothering,good
"Nice to manage time but you should work on notifications. The notifications set before time appear on time of tasks and custom tunes dont work. Apart from these, app is well made and helpful.",good
I need more than 15 days in atypical routine Actually I need 28 days (7x4) i work 7 days in the morning And 7 in the evening And 7 at night,good
"Activity in routine and block should be sync, so it will not show duplicate activites And it will be great it the app can show report by week, month, year",good
Great app... Exactly what I wanted... But it needs frequent troubleshooting owing to some reason unknown to me! Also the programme facility needs subscription which is not economically viable for students like me...,good
"It's a great application for time management. But the only thing bothering me is that every time I have to do this thing like ""refresh your background"" tasks...and the app doesn't work unless I refresh the background tasks ! Can you help me with this please ?",good
App is very good for use mentioned. But the permanent notification not showing many times when any saved task is happening. I have checked all settings like no restrictions for battery saving etc but still permanent notification gone for no reason. Please improve for showing notifications on time also if we have not opened app within few hours..,good
This is a good app for setting up a daily routine. It could be a bit more intuitive to use and I would like to have the ability to copy and paste repeat daily activities rather than to entering them one at a time but once it is set up it is very good.,good
"Seems like a very well made app. Very good for if you want a rigid schedule that has plenty of options for repeating patterns. One thing I would maybe look into adding would be a feature where you could set an assumed cost of an activity such as your daily lunch or dinner, or maybe your commute so that you could plan your budget along with the schedule.",good
"Its a great app if you want a calender or routine app. I really like the colour coded tags for different types of activities. I would love to see a separate to-do list. I would prefer the to-do list to be separate to the calendar, or have a linking capability so that when you schedule your task into your calender it disappears or you have to choice for it to disappear from the to-do list.",good
"Only hope we can adjust the daily routine time automatically, in case we wake up late. Adjust just for the start time, then the other activities below will adapt the time changes. For Developers, the problem is solved. Thank you for the response :)",good
Overall not bad,good
"This is worlds best time table app !! But one problem I think time tune doesn't give me the option or I don't know how to do THIS...PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO SEND IT'S BACKUP THINGY😓😓😭😭 I spent hours to plan the perfect time table but when I got a new phone all my program was lost😭😭😭😭😭😭Can anyone tell me what or how to recover this , is it even possible🥺 Edit: thanks for helping 😊",good
Good app but there are some problems which need to be solved.,good
Nice app not complicated at all.Super easy to use.The perfect app is here .,good
Good,good
This is easy to use and i like tag that have icon it's creative but i have one problem it's don't have check box I want to know how motivation I am in everyday,good
"All is awesome but give the app a tick ✅ mark option, that will help a lot who wants to organize their time.",good
It is great aap for time management,good
It do not ring the alarm!! Do Any know why ??,good
The only problem is that doesn't exist TimeTune for iOS :(,good
"(1/2)Best for students preparing for Competitive.. But I hope There should be more option for different Uses not fixing to only one particular requirement. (2/2) Time Indicating one Showing how accurately we have completed our works..Assume if I Make an Alarm at 6 am and I woke up at 7 am that will be loss so, that should be Highlighted to Not waste the time for next day Further Improvement these type of Options will help us ..🔥",good
Very good experience till now. User friendly. I like it.,good
"Good over all, but not so intuitive",good
"I have been using this app for quite some time and I'm really enjoying it. First thing in the morning I schedule my day, which enables me to spend a v. productive day. I've become quite dependant on it. I'd suggest to add a search option for tags. I have created a bunch of tags and it's really time consuming to scroll all the way over and over again to insert tags. Also, I saw a bunch of great suggestions in the reviews and it would be great if they are implemented.",good
It is very useful app,good
Its great!,good
This app is usfull to mantain the time,good
"is so beautiful and friendly, but has a lot of lag edit: is not lag, it freezes my phone 😹😹",good
It's so good,good
"Works good for me and my needs, easy adding and pleasing and easy to use design. Definitely recommend checking it out!",good
I like app it manages my routine and hlp me make me a good time manager.,good
"The app is really good , it just needs a tick box system to mark what you have done and not done , and a tracker of how many days u ticked off these routines to assess progress",good
I couldn't use this app because it is going here and there so I can't set up the time table,good
"I request developer that if we can add attachments would be much helpful, I'm ok to go for pro version of this feature comes with it... Pls guide me on this.",good
"I really like the app. If only there's a tickbox so that I can check out the tasks done, then it'll be a 5 stars for me. 😊",good
"Im missing the option to archive routines and Id like to remove the first (already set) tag so I can have events without tags aswell as events witj tags, apart of that I like this app alot! Ive tried alot of time planning apps with routines and I like this the best so far. Can recommend!",good
A good app .,good
"Great potential, I'm still trying to figure out the difference routines, programmer and routines but hopefully, this is the answer to teaching homeschool with ADHD.",good
Goodd,good
Excellent so far. Better to include a feature to tick off tasks as a record that it was completed.,good
Been looking for an app like this for a while! I love being able to coordinate things with 'tags' customizable by colours AND icons! I would happily give 5 stars apart from three things: 1. It would be great if there was an option to mark tasks as 'completed'; 2. I don't see much of a difference between the 'time block' and 'routine' choices (generally just looking for advice on this one); and 3. It would be great if we could add more than 3 tags to a time block or routine! 😊,good
What I miss: Option to edit singular block from a routine (e.g. clear or move a routine block if an event for a given day overlaps without pausing the routine) Otherwise great. An implementation of the mentioned feature is a surefire way to make me buy pro.,good
"This app is amazing it has (mostly) all the nessary tools.Though to make this even better you can include a timer. An include it on your wallpaper , otherwise it is a really good app for everyone",good
"Hi I really enjoy and appreciate this app. As a mobile app it works perfectly for me, however I'd really appreciate a computer version that can sync with it. I'm not sure if this exists already? I like that the app is on my phone so that i can constantly check my schedule anywhere - any time, however when I feel the need to adapt and change my schedule, it feels a little cluttered and time consuming. I frequently feel the urge to open it up on my computer as it is easier to work with this interface given the larger screen and increased capability. Please consider this in future upgrades, Regards,",good
Hi. I love the application. I am planning to buy the pro version. I'm just wondering if the pro version is a one time life time already,good
"Great app! I suggest a timer on this one, so we can still track our rest periods every time we take a short rest.",good
I want to say just add on the feature to check the box/things which i have done from my daily time boxing schedule,good
"Honestly a really good app for creating routines. However, I'd like to see a calendar view of my routines and be able to view more than the 2 weeks in the Schedule Tab. The Programmer Tab is one of my favorites! Last thing I would like is to have Activities overlap each other when creating routines. Instead of splitting the long Activity when another Activity is set to times within it.",good
Easy n compatible,good
"Fantastic app, would be nice if it had a calendar feature though.",good
So far so good for time management,good
Great for daily planning. simple and clutter free interface. Good to use.,good
"I would have given it 5 stars but after latest update 3.0, it takes some time to load. Example, earlier when I wanted to change any block, it would be instant editing. But now I have to wait for sometime for it to load.",good
Helpful,good
Absolutely love this app. So much productivity.,good
Please just add alarm and its good easy to use the app,good
"Okay so far as I have used, the app was pretty good. I read that this is s new one, and I like all the features present in it. However there is still lot of room for improvement. I have a small suggestion to make, you could add a new feature that marks things to be done or followed and if not done it sets an overdue and in the end of the day it tells what are done and what are not. That way people will have something that looks out for them as they follow the Timetable :)",good
Good,good
I like it very much it is very good and easy to use,good
Add More icon please,good
"Hi I love this app, but something was really not good about this app. The App Permission thingy, I thought it was automatic but not. I don't know how to possibly fix it but please fix it or help me to fix it. Actually I already turn on the App Permission and This app was allowed but still it says it was Blocked by the System. Hurry Please, I don't want to waste my time anymore.",good
Have found app to be quite helpful. Aids in developing routine and good habit patterns. Beneficial for developing personal discipline.,good
It was wonderful but if you put checkboxes it would be better,good
Love it! Gave it a 2nd try and it really helped me stay on track with my routine. Such intuitive tools and functions. The only problem is that it keeps malfunctioning and doesn't update notifs or even the widget,good
"Good apps, make my life is better. But, why I can't use ringtone as notification ? I can only use vibration for notification.",good
"I like its simplicity and overall functionality. I've been using it for a while. I just purchased the pro version to promote support to developer. Just a little favor, hopefully, we can see the events synced from Google calendars in Events tab and preview the events & routines for the days ahead. Thanks :)",good
"Very useful but in my case i didnt hear a costum sound even though the voice and vibration work, also if i try to pick a song its usually start but the notification didnt do the same and im already check all the troubleshoot. is it because costum sound cant use music?",good
Good app and prompt support.,good
"I like this app very much to create a schedule for everyday and having the reminders. Haven't found any other app which perfectly fits my requirement like TimeTune. But I am always facing the issue where I stop receiving the intimation and have to ""Refresh background apps"" which is very annoying. Hope I can receive support for this issue.",good
Great app..but one suggestion..if you could add the feature of marking whether or not we followed a particular activity in the routine..that would be great.Like if I've planned to study..I can mark whether or not I actually studied.and then it could show the statistics of how much I stuck with my routine.please consider it.also you could add a goal tracker..Love your app.,good
This app is very useful for students and other works,good
"Good and most practical application. But if app's widget could show date, day and current task and next task only or With customization option like that... This would be just awesome...",good
Easy to use,good
It os the best app I ever had. It is wonderful. I love it!!!!!🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀,good
Best time managment app,good
"New update made me little bitter(in routine section ) ,kindly take it back and give the old one. In the routine section , first the app allowed me to edit the routine of daily easily and separately , but now all the days are one by one and not side by side , actually side by side is best and easy to edit , thank you for your reply :-).... Before it was as free but now as constant ad is placed below which is so annoying.",good
"This is a great app, highly recommended. Im not sure if it has a monthly routine option pls do tell about it. Also I would like to know if the data saved can be linked to a user account, so if I change device I can continue using my routine/schedule without adding all over again. Thanks.",good
It's a good app,good
One of the cleanest UI's I might have ever used. I understand that the app is made for us to be able to stick to our schedules! But I think it's a shame they're not letting us double it's use as a time log too! I think the statistics can be made more informative like graphical representations and stuff. And we should also be given an option to just log in our schedules day after day without using the routines function because I have different schedules everyday!,good
Preety good,good
Very easy to make new routines and activities if you want to organize your time a little better,good
A really awsm app to make and maintain a schedule. It really helps a lot in time management.,good
"The background is very bland, you could have more colors. I also noticed that the app keeps crashing",good
Meh,good
"Best and cleanest scheduling app I've found by far. It has it all: multiple schedules repeating on custom intervals, visually effective tags, comments visible on table and notifications, widget, statistics, events, dark theme. All without adding unnecessary noise. Using it is extremely intuitive. Doesn't lock any significant features behind premium wall, instead they're just extras that are nice to have (which is a rarity). But one thing that's missing is the ability to copy events/activities.",good
"Bene, ma non e possibile trovarlo sul mio smartphone Huawei. Carica anche la tua applicazione sulla APP GALLERIA di Huawei",good
"Great app! I use TimeTune to time block my entire day into short segments. A few fixes: [ when scheduling a day in advance, the time auto-sets to 24 hours (ending next day). If I scheduled breakfast from 8:00 AM to 8:30 AM, it automatically sets to 830 AM the next day. Very tedious to change.] [difficult to see overlapping tasks] [no easy way to push an entire schedule back, if you are late on one item, and need to push everything by 10 min for example. You have to change each manually.]",good
Pretty good,good
"I like this app, I am just unsure whether I can sync one profile on two devices. I dont want to purchase the pro version for both my devices and have to set up my different routines for each app.",good
"They should make a website, that is in sync with your phone",good
Troubleshooting problem. Unable to notify events on time. If these problems are sorted this application is very useful. Best for people who want a timetable application that is simple and easy to use.,good
"Hi , i use this app to manage my studying And it works very nice But if it had a calendar it would be excellent If you can , please add a nice calendar to the app, that it shows our tasks too  Thanks for your amazing app",good
very good app,good
I wish this app was available on ipad.,good
It's good but i think it would be better if the routines could be sorted,good
I like and Immediately boight the Pro,good
Mast hai bhai,good
"I really like this app for my phone. My favorite part is the voice notification. It really helps with my kids homeschooling. I set the voice to tell them that its time for school and to sit at the table, then it plays a little song. I love this because now when they hear this they turnoff their morning cartoons, put their dishes in the sink, grab their notebooks then sit at the table. I love that I don't have to keep tell them to get to the table anymore. The only thing I would suggest is having the option to make my schedule on the computer too and be able to link the two devises. Like how google does with their calendar app. Other than that I really like this app.",good
"I LOVE THIS APP, ITS VERY HELFUL FOR ME TO DO MY ROUTINE.",good
I wish I could donate in exchange.for getting rid of the ad at the bottom.,good
"I just started using this. One thing I would like to see is the ability to add check boxes to an event. For example I have a time slot labeled housework scheduled from 11am to 12pm. I would like to be able to tap on that block of time and see that I need to do dishes, vaccume, and dust in that time frame, and be able to mark off each task as it is complete.",good
"Amazing app, really organized, I do think the app should be a little bit more colourful and have a more minimalist design.. and should stop shutting down in the background after like 5 hours",good
The only schedule app I undrstood..easy to use,good
So good,good
Gud,good
"Everything is up to mark. Just the feature ""persistent notification"" sometimes doesn't show up. I would request the timetune maintainers to please check this. Otherwise, I love this app! ❤",good
It was really helpful to keep track of what I have to do everyday. I think that it is easy to use and it could be even better one day,good
"Realmente ayuda mucho, me sirvió bastante pero.. Parece haber un problema con las notificaciones sonoras, solo me avisa visualmente. Por eso lo califico como 4 estrellas",good
"Only just started using this app. Looks good but it would be great to have a calender view so that you can easily see what's coming up in the month. Edit: I will go as far as to say that I will end up deleting this app, even though I already paid for it, if there isn't a calender view added eventually.",good
Very useful app for routine planning. Loved it 👍,good
"love the app,any chance we'll be getting an iOS version of it too? and be able to sync everything across all devices (maybe even a desktop version of the app)",good
"New to the app, but it looks very useful based on what I've seen thus far. I'm looking for an option we're saved routines can be implemented into the daily schedule, but are also tied to a kind of countdown timer that corresponds to the specific routine added (e.g., impromptu select ""laundry"" and it's automatically integrated/layered onto present schedule w/ a countdown clock allowing for whatever amount of time you preset for that routine). If it had/has that, then it's five stars for me.",good
Grt,good
"I love how many options you have for setting notifications. My Fasting routine notifies me at the start, 30 mins before it ends, and when it ends. Very cool. The app is missing two pretty big features though. 1. The ability to see how your routines overlap. Right now it's completely unintuitive. You basically have to do math in your head to understand your schedule 2. An indication for what the current time is. Again, math in your head. A schedule is supposed to help you visualize your time",good
"This app was quite useful to have and something I think that I needed. The only thing that put me off was the 'premium '. It slightly ruins it so I would definitely make everything accessible to everyone if I would change something about this app. Other than that, quite handy little app that will probably make a difference to your day!",good
Amazing app! It easily allows you to manage routines and plan your day. The only thing I would add is the ability to write tasks and then have the ability to add them to the schedule.,good
How do you decrease the timing of the alarm??My only question😃,good
Good,good
"I really liked this app. This helps me remember things on time but the only problem is that, it doesn't give Pop up or notification sound so every time I've to check my next task.",good
"very nice app, easy to use, the best organizer, to do, reminder. It's like having a complete pack with u. But only thing is you have to put some efforts and time in typing ur routines.",good
Its good,good
"This is my first time using a scbedule app and I love it so far! However, I'm a little bit confused on how it's supposed to work: I'm able to set up routines for everyday instead for single days in a week? I'm asking this, because when I made my routines for Monady, everything went smoothly, but when the next day comes, my routines aren't showing up at my schedule anymore. Do i have to set up the routines for EACH DAY, for my routines to be at the schedule, or is there a better option?",good
Good,good
Its been super helpful during this homeschooling process however sometimes the notifcation sound just keeps going and the only way to shut it off is to stop what im doing and go into the app itself. It wont let me remove it from my notifications during these times either. Its not everytime just sometimes.,good
"it's good for now, but i wish there was a way of crossing out the tasks or things i've already done. and also to be able to put tags when it's not a routine",good
The app really nice.....i request that the voice notification should be made more clearer and voice should be like dominating that can make orders,good
"I loved the app, its unreal!! The only reason i give it four stars is because i would add a section with to do list opcions for the tasks that doesn't have an specific time!!! Do that and i'll give you five stars",good
"Really beneficial, it allows me to follow my routines efficiently",good
"The alarm sound doesn't work, so i could not know it already the time...",good
"I miss the timer function, please put it back. Reply to Developer's suggestion for a new pomodoro timer: Unless it's markedly better than the hundreds of timer apps available in the store and at a more competitive price, I wouldn't consider a new timer app from you. As it stands now, I've held back from upgrading to the revamped version on one of my phones as it takes away functions including the timer, a feature that makes the old app stand out and superior to the deluge of other similar apps",good
"Really good app for organizing your daily routines, definitely worth getting. Wish simultaneous activities were better displayed, though!",good
It's well put together. I think it works very well for that it's for and can help provide structure to your day. The next step for the app is to incorporate goals and goal metrics. Help me track if I'm getting 8 hours of sleep a night or studying 12 hours a week.,good
"Great app with widget some more. But i wish can add in ""all day event"". So that i can include daily task.",good
Not complete but nice,good
Even after buying it displays ads and says it is a free version.... After some time it is working ( got an technical support too from the app manufacturer Tq),good
Lovely and simple,good
I will like one more option in settings -> calendar sync -> [checkbox] push events to google calendar ... I know it's not good to receive notifications from two places but on galaxy phones always on display shows only events that are listed in google calendar or samsung calendar app and I really like my schedule on always on display screen... please do it this will help all galaxy users.,good
"This is the app I've been looking for but there's still room for improvement. First off, when setting the default notification to x amount of minutes before, it would make most sense to also have a notification the moment it actually happens, or at least have the option to do so without having to do it manually for every single entry. Second there is a lack of flexibility. There should be a way to easily move around and resize items on your schedule without changing the routines themselves.",good
Very useful,good
it's a great app But it would be even better if there was an option to see the whole week schedule in one place. I hope you guys will add such an option in further updates. 🍻,good
"Have relied on this app for work since it 1st came out. Great for project management & tracking/budgeting time. REQUESTS: • Please bring back hourly repeat function (i.e. Set an event to repeat every 3 hours). It was a useful Interval timer. • CHROME EXTENSION or online version (as paid user, I'd pay more for this). • Increase maximum # of days for atypical routines, with option to create monthly routines. • Sync Google tasks & reminders (in addition to events). 2-way sync w/Google Thanks!",good
So much effective app,good
"It's great! Really been helping me keep tract of time and doing school work. The only problem I'm having is having a notification sound. I get a notification, but there's no sound and I don't notice it. My sound is turned all the way up and I haven't silenced them.",good
"I understand the function of the switch. What I meant is that once I had attended to a reminder, I could delete it so that I could remain with a clean slate for future use. Now, combining events and reminders makes it hard to have a clean slate at the beginning of each day cause you can't delete recurring events. I just want reminders tab that's separate from events so that I can always clean my reminders up at the end of each day and know which ones need to be done the next. The app was so elaborate when events and reminders were separate functions.",good
"It's a nice app with a simple interface. The widget is also very useful. However, I think it lacks a daily or weekly to do list.",good
"Very useful app, and some understandable problems with notifications.",good
"This app is great!!! From a students perspective I love how you can make different schedules, like one for this and one for that. It's so easy and user friendly, I ❤ it. One thing they should add is a way that I can access this app with my schedules on both my phone and tablet without having to copy out the entire schedule again. ⭐⭐⭐⭐",good
"This app is super useful to keep me scheduled. I only have the free version, but it's still really useful. I like how it looks and how I can look at how much time I put into certain activities. I also like how I can set multiple notifications for the same activity. You can also change each individual notification however you want. The app is very user friendly. I would definitely recommend 👍",good
"I want to make a weekly habit (routine), but there's not any option to choose the name of the week's and plan! please add that option (instead of day 1, day 2 add: Sunday, Monday) and a option to choose first day of the week. thanks.",good
It's really a good app to track your daily routine and set reminders but i will be more satisfied if it gets upgrade to a more better look and more tracking options...,good
Simple and nice. Can add up little more,good
Good,good
Best,good
I miss the old lay out of lines instead of squares on the daily calendar... Now it feels like Google calendar wish they gave the option of choosing the display layout.,good
Update: It would make more sense to have the schedule tab as just the schedule layed out where you have the time of day scale to the left ( editable show just hours or hours and minutes) and then the activity from the routine/s at the correct time. And the only way to edit the routine could be only through the routine tab (as thats where I assume you want the main part to edit routines to be). But I love how you can save different routines for each day. Not to sure what programmer is for?,good
very nice app ..i liked it,good
This app for students are xawesome but the thing I don't like is that there is no tracker. I can't see the what I did in the last week. Other wise the various options for alarm and the stickers are perfect.........,good
"Nice app but online synchronization and cloud connection is required in case we miss the phone, its very important today.",good
It is very helpful app,good
Good app,good
"This apps quite easy to use and looks simple. Just it doesn't really meet my requirements, it can be better if it got the calendar and tickbox. I've purchased it but it still like the same. It said sync to my calendar but it didn't shows what I've planned in my google calendar. The only thing I am satisfield is the notification sounds.",good
Not upto the mark but its okay. Ads give ptoblem and ui is little weak.,good
"Developer responded to my issue quickly and politely. App is pretty good so far, maybe a little more clarity is needed about the user interface for dummies like me :) Like an arrow to indicate I can swipe for the rest of my schedule.",good
I think the app really helps you stay organized. It really helped me out. The only complaint I have it that you have to pay for the premium version but I mean... how else are you supposed to be able to make money off of an app so...,good
Real good. You star focus on you schedule and all the dead times,good
"Make some more widgets, rest all app is nice and user-friendly",good
Can sync it to laptop?,good
I love this app and the idea behind it with the weekly and daily routines. I wish I could view my month or week at a glance however so I can see my weekly routine and how my non reoccurring events affect and lay out with my routine.,good
Decent,good
Easy to use and very useful especially spending lots of time at home at the moment,good
"A great app but i miss a overview of week activity's, the app get confusing to use after adding some tasks",good
This app is great so far. But I wish there was an option to select several days at a time for each routine.. if there is already pls let me know.,good
"Fine app. Would be perfect to have desktop web version also, to make adding routine much easier.",good
Amazing helps manage your time and habit formation,good
Good app and really helpful with time management and staying organized,good
It's simply the best for time allocation to activities and routines.,good
😐😐😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘,good
Nāo é exatamente Oque estou Procurando,good
"It's an excellent app but I would ditch the ads, you shouldn't need theme with a premium version available. They make your app look cheap and distract users.",good
Nice app It helps a lot to save time. You will understand where you used more time and where you should spend more time.,good
Beautiful app for personal growthv,good
"This helps me so much, thank you!",good
Good,good
Shiv Raj Singh,good
"This is an amazing app!! Highly recommended for schedules. It has daily,weekly and atypical schedules, and notifications and pop ups too!",good
Absolutely amazing app! I just counted & this was the 5th daily checklist type app that I tried. For others looking for an app that schedules your time in a day & organize your daily to do list = This is the app you need. It has everything I was looking for in a daily planner/schedule. I'm keeping this app! Love the tags & notification options! So easy to use! So organized.. I love it!,good
"By far the best daily planner I've come across. I rarely write reviews, but I found that this app in particular deserves one. It is easy to use, and does exactly what is intended, I haven't come across anything better.",good
"Theres a bug, cant edit the blocks. Thank you.",good
Great and usefull,good
Oooof ❤️,good
It is a superb app I like this app very much,good
Finally a planner that allows me to put work in as a nightshift. Just wish we could personalise weeks more. So only a certain task Monday to Friday type of thing.,good
"It was a fantastic app.....I use it to schedule my Kpop Idol training schedule, My languages learning (Korean,English,Japanese,Chinese,etc), My school schedule, And also my FUN Times too...REALLY THANKFUL FOR YOUR APP😻😻😻",good
Your app is very nice but please also available for Windows and Mac PC or maybe be chrome extension.,good
Great time-line ⌚,good
"Simple, Practical, & to the point app without any unnecessary features to make it complex",good
"Nice ,and better app easy to make timetable i can reamind every thing",good
The best,good
I love this app... It has a perfect schedule for us.. like people like me who want to be scheduled but cant be organised...,good
Worst app,good
Thats exactly i was finding for ❣️,good
The best. (periodt),good
Nice,good
"Simple, fast and no annoying ads. Good price for pro version not a rip off. I love to have different theme options, as an addition to the list view of schedule, it would be really nice seeing the day as clock with separately colored pie chart.",good
Well,good
"This is such a great app. Unfortunately, i am planning to move to iPhone and this is not available on the App Store. Really breaks my heart.",good
This app is very helpful for study . So this app is very helpful for me.😊😊⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰⏰😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😍😍😄😍,good
The app is exactly what I was searching for since a long long time. It would be even better if there was some web app or desktop app for it.,good
Best app for schedule making,good
"As someone who procrastinates constantly and needs a routine to keep myself focused, this app is amazing. The constant notification with personalized icons makes it so easy and helpful to keep track of what's going on and what I need to do next. No, this app isn't perfect. But I've found great use from it. I recommend getting the pro version. It's only 5 dollars and the programmer is SUPER useful :)",good
Best !!!!!,good
"A great app but it would be nice to add a feature to plan a schedule for tomorrow( any further date) on the day before. Making a schedule the night before for next day is a hassle. It keeps reverting back to routines and the current day, everytime pressing schedule and swiping to change date is time consuming to add blocks.",good
"Brilliant app, exactly what I was looking for, heart felt appreciation for the team involved.Thank you❤️",good
So far so good!,good
"Its really a great app.But after recent update,it lost some features.Its not highlighting the current task in schedule pannel.Add this feature again in the next update... *EDIT : There is no ' now' icon on the top bar.By the way,the method of highlighting the current task in schedule option before this update was better than the present way of highlighting.😑 It's better to highlight the whole sentence instead of highlighting only the borders👍",good
"thanks TimeTune❤️ been using ur app since 2018: ✅ I achieved 1st place at local singing competition since you always remind me to practice ✅ U always reminded me to work out at gym, now I'm in a better shape ✅ I made my clients happy because I arranged all my responsibilities fit their needs at a perfect time Thanks, will abosulely still using this when Alien invade the earth one day",good
I think this app will be amazing by seeing the reviews. I hope that it will be superb. I give 5 stars because it is like this app I was finding 😊,good
Loving the app. It'd be amazing if you could do calendar integrations with Outlook/ Gmail so that my work appointments could be reflected automatically.,good
Time to pick my life up and awaken my life.,good
"Good app, Will there be a way to input a hex code for the color to the widget in a future update?",good
I think it's a great app...it has helped a lot...very efficient takes getting used to like any other app...I like this app very much😊👌,good
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,good
Give us the damn todo list and app blocker all in one too 😌,good
Just started and I finding this very easy operate. Thank you!,good
"I love this app. I have been able to put my life together just by the free features of this app. I would always stress about having to do certain things everyday. I wouldn't do them because I had to remember to do them every day. Because of this app I don't have to remember to do them. I get reminded to do them and I do them happily. If I hadn't found this app, I don't know if I would have ever put my life together.",good
Nice app,good
"If u want to be an organized person then u should have this app....🔥 This was the app I was looking for.. It has many features... I can make a schedule for a particular day with a tag, title, description, and the main alarm.... 😍😍😍🔥🔥🧡🧡🧡 I loved this app ..",good
What an app,good
Great App! Absolutely love using it to plan out my day! Thank you!,good
Excellent,good
"It works perfectly, for us the best app",good
"I've only just started using this app, but it seems to be exactly what I was looking for. It allows you to create customised event types, programme start and end times for events, set repeating events. It's simple, but not lacking in features. One suggestion I have is the ability to see a weekly view of the schedule.",good
It is quite good for managing your schedule and having your schedule written down somewhere instead of it being in your head. You could definitely use it for your professional life. I only use it for personal.,good
It's amazing. I like the way it is so don't try anything odd. Soon I will try the premium,good
Best of its kind 👍.,good
i like this app. it would be nice if it highlights what part of your routine you are in.,good
"Nice, exactly what I needed",good
Easy to use app for making a schedule. I like it very much.,good
This app is very helpful....❤️❤️ It really helps me to optimize my time and do things schedule-wise.....🙏🙏👍 awesome and productive app.....thanks to developers......,good
Awesome! Helps keep track of all your day to day activities and it can sync to your calendar's!,good
Finally found what I'm looking for. Great app!,good
Make for IOS Please,good
I just came back from a year or more of not using the app (I didn't really have a routine) and I've gotta say the design changes are amazing. It's visually easier to navigate and edit. The ideas in blocks are great. Can't wait to see you implement more things to do with overlaps and such.,good
"This app is freaking phenomenal! Instead of having a billion alarms in my phone that I have to go over all the time, I can just set up schedules and go about my day. I have my daughter's school schedule since we're distance learning. My son's band schedule. My work routine. Even simple things like when to brush my teeth so nothing gets missed in the chaos that is quarantine life. I have ADHD, so being hyper-organized is super important for me, and this app cuts out so much stress!",good
Very helpful,good
I like the way,good
"Clean & straightforward interface! The widget is transparent in my homescreen which I really liked. Maybe, adjusting the tags in two columns looks much more cleaner. Anyways, thanks for this app!",good
Love it ... Recently buy pro version ❤️,good
I have updated routines and enabled it in programmer. I dont see any in my schedules. Schedules is totally blank. Later it got updated so changing review to little better because. But from the previous design to now i feel like i have to enter so much. Something is wrong with the app.,good
Best app of time management,good
this app is my second brain. i realy love it and he help me to organize my life,good
Nice love the new update.. Gud ui nd very user friendly thnk u very much ♥️♥️♥️ Keep up the gud work. And keep updating just love it..,good
"Very extensive in how you can plan things out, and make routines, it's very nice",good
Sangat membantu sekali,good
Super app,good
It's awesome that it is free for all of the things that it offers! Such a great app.,good
"This app is my life, literally. My watch reminds me of the next part of my day. Blocking out time each day for what matters helps me get everything done. As a working mom, wife and dog owner that means everything ❤",good
Good job! Keep up the great work!,good
"I loved this all before, but with the new updates, it is the BEST!! I lose track of time easily and this allows me to make a schedule and choose which items give a notification. This helps me SO MUCH to stay on track throughout the day. Perfect for an ADHD brain! I'm a homeschool mom with a busy schedule and I struggle to keep the household running efficiently. This app is a gift to me!! Additionally ... I haven't encountered a single ad. ❤️❤️ Well-designed app. HUGS TO THE DEVELOPERS!!",good
I like this,good
"Perfeito! Demanda um pouco de paciência para dominar o aplicativo, porém, nada mais justo. Isso porque o aplicativo apresenta inúmeras funções e, diferente dos demais simples, não deixa nada a desejar.",good
It's a perfect time scheduling app ✨,good
In India now most of the people do their work digitally earlier we wrote time table on a paper but now we can do this with apps but usually we so not find perfect apps for such things but this app is all time perfect for time management,good
Excellent app,good
Best app,good
Great app! It helps me to manage my time well!,good
"NICE AND GOOD LOOKING INTERFACE 👌, PERSONALLY LIKED IT !",good
One of the best,good
Very useful app... It is possible to set a very useful study schedule..Thank you 😍🤝🤝,good
"I have remote learners and this app is so helpful when keeping track of their school schedule. Highly recommended. I have the free version so I'm not sure if the pro version allows you to designate a specific routine within a specific date within a calendar app, but I can import a specific routine per day with the free version and it's been very useful.",good
Excellent,good
Supperb...,good
I like it,good
Amazing app.Nice work dev..,good
"This app is my saviour during quarantine. Now that I have a schedule, what's up next in the day, my anxiety level has gone way down. I'm so glad I downloaded this app. I love how on top of notifications there's a voice saying aloud to what's coming up. A minor issue is that ""reading"" is pronounced ""reding"". Great app.",good
My favourit Good,good
Simple and easy to use! I only wished I could see it in a calendar view?,good
"I absolutely love timetune!!!! Easy to follow interface, nice colors and super efficient. Check it out and if you like it, the pro version is so worth it! THANK🙏YOU TIMETUNE!!👏 🥰🥰🥰🥰",good
Best time table app but required below functions which i really needs: ✓Auto copy previous routines and time for upcoming suggestions ✓ connect social media or make personal log in account ✓ send routine data to trainer or teacher through email in PDF or docs etc ✓save data into PDF to make printed chart ✓adding images into routines ✓cloud saving,good
After trying a lot of time blocking apps.. to do lists.. i hav came down to this app.. its very convenient,good
Good app,good
Great app. But I'd like to make a suggestion. Have an option to set the default day on custom routines to day 1 when activated. It currently defaults to which ever day you closed the app. And as such some of my alarms don't go off because they are on day 1 and the routine gas started on day 2.,good
It really helps if you are trying to build a system / routine using the routine feature wich can be applied and customised in the schedule section .. It would be cool if U can add an infinite sub-sub-tasks . thanks developers Great job !,good
This app helps me to be more oganized,good
Best time management app on Playstore - hands down,good
it's the best best app ever,good
Excellent,good
"Just starting using it and I can already tell how great it is at keeping you on schedule! I've done schedules before, but with this App, it makes it so much easier to stay on track! :)",good
Best,good
"I love this app, is really good and easy to use, but I don't know why I'm having problems, it seems that my phone blocked the app or the notifications are turn off, but I already turn them on but it keeps saying it isn't working, I need some help. Anyways the app is excellent.",good
Absouletely incredible.,good
"BEST, TRY THAT",good
Loved it,good
"I love this app, it is so helpfull",good
I have been using this application for 1 week. I am giving five stars to this application because after downloading this application I am getting my work done on time. I have benefited a lot from this application. People who want to do their work at certain times and change their lives. Do download this application.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,good
Best,good
nice app,good
"Easy to use, manageable ,time management",good
I have been trying this app for 4 days and it's really effective. Thankyou developers for making this app.I hope you will make ot even better in the upcoming days 😊,good
Great,good
"This app helps you edit your routine anytime as per one flexible time.This is very useful for people like me who find it difficult to follow a routine but helps us to be on track and guides us to know what to do next. You can alot time at irregular basis eg a task can be for 20 mins whereas the other could be for 90 mins. The notification are at par and do good job at reminding us our next task. The information that one needs to fill in when adding a task, is accurate and is easy. This app is the best one and would not like to replace it with any other to use for my studies, also for this reason i would be looking forward to an app for the PC's or at least a web",good
"Overall, I like the latest update. It's perfect for making schedules. I do wish the blocks had two catagories, past & upcoming so I don't have to scroll past old events to get to my current events. I also wish blocks still had the personal icons instead of only tags.",good
Perfect❤,good
"This is a really really great app, 😆😆",good
Useful,good
"Nice scheduler. But I hope in the future, there would be a clock shaped schedule as a widget",good
"really competent scheduling app, worth premium imo. would be improved if i could edit from a webapp and it could do browser notifications. Actually, even just editing from a browser and doing notifications from my phone would be Super helpful",good
"As a person with autism and adhd, this is great! Started using it today, somehow got the pro version even though i dont remember paying. Cant see any faults yet, and if i do, ill let the devs know",good
Nice app to keep my life organised,good
I really like this app. It's easy to use and has really helped me keep a routine.,good
As great as heck😍,good
It's good,good
"WONDERFUL APP Even though at first I didn't going well with this app, I realized I just need to learn more about it :) but I still did not understand what ""activities"" means :)",good
mm yes good,good
"This has been super helpful in guiding me through a chaotic, quarantine school day. Thank you so much! : D",good
This app has been a great tool for me. Has allow me to organize my time and schedule and because of that now I can be more productive. It's amazing.,good
Пять из пяти,good
"solid app that so far holds the title of most useful scheduling app for my adhd ass. it can take a little time to figure out, but its pretty intuitive once you get the hang of it.",good
Nice app. I just got the pro version because it ultimately replace my daily planner book.,good
I am in love with this app it is so useful because I am a giant perfectionist and I have looking for the perfect planner for a while,good
Nice experience,good
Awsm app,good
"Amazing app. It covers basically everything required to plan your schedule efficiently. Kudos to the developer team, keep it up!",good
Very nice app,good
Simple app for goal setters,good
Good... Very good !!,good
Great App for students,good
It is an awesome app. The perfect app for well structures productivity.,good
I like this app. I've tried many apps and this is the most suitable and beautiful app I've came across. Just what I needed. Thank you :),good
Love it!!!! 👍🏼👍🏼 Never gave thought to a app like this. Just happened to see it while downloading another app. Checked it out. Downloaded it. And already love it. Really gonna help me stay on track with home schooling my son. Thanks,good
Very good app,good
Excellent app. Really helps me stay organised.,good
I like this app because it's simple and easy to use.,good
Good app for productivity,good
Nice app,good
"Excellent App!! I regret knowing this app sooo late😁!! The best Thing was the 'Customisable Alarms/Notifications' ... As a student, im in love with this app! It help me stick to the timings... Also, the app didnt ask me to rate it! Instead i was findig where to Rate?? In Short : A great app!! Good going guys😊",good
"Me encanta, con esta aplicación puedo hacer exactamente lo que necesito. La use por mucho tiempo, pero ahora me cambie a iPhone y no esta disponible para esos dispositivos. Me encantaría que pudieran extenderse a iPhone.",good
It's very easy to use and it's perfect for making schedules. I highly recommend using it !,good
"No doubt! It is the best time management app I have ever used and I have recommended this app to many of my School friends. Help me: I have created my routine in one mobile and I sometimes use another mobile as well, I just want to know how I can link both apps to notify me on other mobile also or Do i need to create the routine again ? . I appreciate you guys for making this wonderful app. I am also looking forward to see new great features in the app. 🙂",good
The best apps to organize your life's schedule,good
Great app!!,good
Nice application for students also,good
Using this app since 2017. Love it,good
Great app. I'm glad I found it.,good
I'm using app for pomedro method. Set 25 minutes work and 5 break. It's more best than set timer instead.,good
This is a very good app for daily routine and I Love it a lot.,good
"Great app, would recommend to anybody who wants a decent routine app.",good
Amazing app it is best for your whole planning .,good
Love it; simple & efficient!,good
I want to say only one thing that is .This app is to good . Because second thing u will know when you install it.,good
it is so far a good app hopefully it keeps me on track,good
Absolutely love this! I love that you can copy schedules so you don't have to keep doing repeats. I can't wait to see what else this can do!,good
This app is perfect for someone like me who forgets everything! It helps structure my weekly routines so that I don't have to stress about remembering all kinds of different tasks and helps clear my mind for more important things 🔥,good
Made my day efficient 🌹thank you ❤️,good
Fabulous app thare is all type for making schedule . Very helpful app for me 👌👌,good
Very nice app not irritating and helping students Really,good
This app is just amazing.,good
"Great app, it's absolutely perfect for what I do, the only gripe is that the comment section on the schedule block could be bigger, it limits me and I can't jot down everything I can. I hope the developers will see this message and extend it as I think it's an easy fix and would benefit a lot of users very much, thanks!",good
Nice app,good
I reallly liked this app for my phone and i also suggest all to download the app fastly .my words are less to describe the app and it is really the best app and brilliant app,good
"The design looked much better before, especially the widget. Wish there was a way to switch to previous design. Edit - it seems that the widget design is growing on me, so I changed the rating. Functionally the app is still great.",good
Awesome app! Really I didn't think I'd be able to manage my schedules and daily routines so easily. UI is really valued here. You really have to use this app now.,good
"Incredible, scheduling app, it's like having your own diary secretary. Keep up the good work. Please provide the option to back up in the cloud.",good
I needed a simple app that I can schedule my day throughout. This has a VERY simple interface and a very visually appealing aesthetic. I love it so far! What would really fit the bill even better is if I can drag and drop blocks. Sometimes I have to shift priorities and it messes up my schedule and I need to manually go in and change things in every block thereafter.,good
"Now that I've been using this app for a while, I don't know how I'd survive without it! Keeps me on track and motivated, and is just plain simple while also attractive. No annoyances, easy to customize... Love it!!!",good
Great,good
I love how simple it is to schedule your activities for the day.,good
Very Nice!!!!!,good
Very useful and nice features. Helps create a routined lifestyle.,good
This app is useful for students,good
so far this app is the best...It's helping,good
Promising,good
"Love the app, it serves its purpose well. I've found that routines are a must for effective and long term habit building. The latest update allows 2 tags per time slot which is awesome. But, the notes now visually appear seperate, or disconnected from the timeslot and tag. It's really just an aesthetic issue, but I do wish it were fixed.",good
"The app is very handy and helpful but the tag ""break"" can't be removed and it occures in every task planned. That makes the good visuals unhelpful and confusing. If that would work 5 stars.",good
Очень хорошее и удобное приложение!,good
"Just downloaded this app and set up everything in a snap. Super easy to use and customize hours, multiple timetables, tags, etc. Only had it for 20 minutes but love it so far! Update Aug 2020: the UI seems to be unnecessarily cluttered since the latest update. I loved the ease and simplicity and it was the only app that gave me exactly what I was looking for: a simple, clean, flexible TIMETABLING app, not a calendar or a to do list. Now it seems like they're trying to fit too much into the app😕",good
Op bolte,good
Very very very very very very very very very very very very very helpful app,good
Best app for planning and to make us follow it,good
"One of the best, if not, the best schedule app with a lot of customisation .",good
"It took me a bit to get the hang of doing schedules that dont happen on a regular interval, but now i love this app. i use it everyday to keep me on top of what i need to be doing. i think its going to be very useful for when school starts up this fall, considering all of my classes are thru distance learning.",good
You have to pay extra to continue after a free trial.,poor
Why have I been logged out and cant reset my password to get back in?,poor
I'd love to use this app if there was any other payment method than with a credit card (which I don't have and don't want).,poor
Its not free,poor
Thiefs!! I cancelled last year after my free trial and they still took $35.00 and refused to refund my money. I verified it was cancelled and woke up this morning to them stealing another $35.00. I don't even use their crappy product!!!!!! OH AND THERE IS NO WAY BESIDES E-MAIL TO GET AHOLD OF THEM!!,poor
Downloaded free trial and looked at it first day and it wasn't really easy to use so didn't look at it again. I had no correspondence from them to tell me that the trial was over and that they were going to take the money. I find that deceptive behaviour as they are banking o people forgetting to cancel.,poor
Although its.pretty I did not use it so cancelled the subscription. They have billed me again for this even though cancelled through their service and following their instructions on how to do it so ensure you use a payment method they can't override.,poor
"Deceiving little app! Nowhere in your app or YouTube commercial did it state that for the first 2 week trial, that you needed a credit card on file. I CAN NOT use the 2 week trial unless I have a credit card on file, that really sucks! Why call it a trail, it's more like an ambush.",poor
"I can't pay for it?? It says ""platform error"" something about ""IAP not prepared"", so can't do free trial either...please help",poor
"Why, why, why... Let us try it without forcing us to pay first. You just lost a customer.",poor
Hate,poor
Did not like this at all. Difficult to sync with all my different calendars and limited formatting and design options as well. Also hard to unsubscribe. Very round about process. I do not recommend this.,poor
Tried to put in my first event and it failed to log it. I uninstalled it same day.,poor
"There's one thing that makes me crazy about apps. It's when their developers don't tell you up front what the cost is of after the free trial. So, I won't be trying this as much as I'd like to.",poor
"I did the free trial. This planner does NOT have push notifications. You can set up your events and appointments, even make them reoccurring, but Artful Agenda App will NOT remind you or notify you. What good is a digital planner if it does not have push notifications. If I am going to pay for an app, it should at least have most of the features a free app has.",poor
Impossible to use.,poor
My events show up at the wrong time in my calendar even when they've been manually entered. What's the point of a planner that doest let you plan.,poor
"If this was free, yeah I'd totally use this. Who honestly wants to pay to keep track of your life? Wth?",poor
only option is paid subsctiption app? No thanks. I can't constantly pay for apps within my budget so I'd much rather have the option to use a version with ads.,poor
"Update: After I read the reply I redownloaded this app. Waste of $4.25! It's NOT WORTH ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY! Not a lot of extras to charge money AND it's only cute on a computer. The ""lists"" are not very easy to make and I never did find the ""meal plan"" or journal parts. The goal part is not on the app. Any.do is FREE and a lot easier for lists with reminders and also includes a calendar. Not worth the cost. Yeah it's cute but not as easy to use as other free calendars. Pretty disappointed...",poor
Terrible! I transferred all my lists from Google to this app do they would all be in one place and they didn't save! So beyond frustrating.,poor
App install page says nothing about it being a free trial for 2 weeks. So you have to pay to use this app. This is not disclosed on the app page from which you initiate install.,poor
"I downloaded this after seeing someone advertise it. Looked cool so I figured try it out, right? Until I downloaded and it prompted me for a subscription. Lady you are nuts. People rather by the paper agenda at the store for cheaper. You do not see the full texture of the book, it's an online planner on top of it. I'm not paying you for that. I downloaded a FREE calendar that does the exact same thing. Terrible marketing skills.",poor
could you make an option to not stop the trial because i dont think some people want to do the trial and it doesn't mention that before you download the app and when you do you guys get paid.,poor
It wouldn't let me try the app. It just told me to subscribe.,poor
"SLOW on laptop, does not sync with website. No stickers on app, just laptop. I set up my calander on my ohone, then went to desktop. I can't open up my calander unlesss I give payment info on laptop. I already set up payment in Google Play. And to get to that screen takes a LONG time.",poor
You can't even try it out. They are automatically asking you to pick a subscriber plan before you can even see a calendar or anything.,poor
This is a pay to play calendar only,poor
"This app is a total rip-off! I stupidly paid for the one-time subscription of $35.00, had the app less than one hour. The print was so tiny I could barely see it. A lesson learned the hard way...no more app subscriptions for me. Users beware! Forewarned is forarmed. Hang on to your wallets if you try out this app!",poor
Doesn't work. Error messages appear everywhere when I open the app.,poor
always freezing,poor
"I had to uninstall this app and cancel my subscription. Not only did this app slow my phone and cause glitches but the second I uninstalled it my phone went back to normal with no issues. The concept is great and I'm sure it works well on Apple products but without a dark mode in 2020, no ability to use a stylist (Note 9) to write notes and I cannot add multiple google and Microsoft calendars to the agenda it does less than the calendar my phone came with. This just doesn't do enough for me.",poor
"It's 2020 and there's no dark theme for this? Are you serious? I can make it tolerable on desktop by forcing a dark theme but I can't on my phone. This is a huge deal-breaker for me. Accessibility is a real thing, devs.",poor
I just signed up and I can't even access anything. Keeps saying error code 7.,poor
"Looks pretty, but when exchanged to Canadian it's too expensive (almost $50/yr). Not even worth checking out the free trial since there's no way I can maintain that.",poor
"I wanted to love it. And I did, until I needed to add my other Gmail accts to it. Damn near IMPOSSIBLE. I am currently in the 2 wk trial. I reached out to tech support asking for an explanation on how to sync my other accounts, as all of the app tutorials didn't mention how. They sent me back a link to a FAQ telling me WHAT to do, but not HOW to do it. Every Google search had me come up short. I give up. Cancelling. My default calendar syncs em all just fine. Wish I had the pretty stickers, etc.",poor
"While in looks this app is lovely, it had a big issue for me, price. I am always looking for an android replacement for goodnotes (an ios exclusive app I use for digital planning). Visualy the app is beautiful and it seemed to be very well put together, but be willing to pay $40 a year (special price?) monthly $4.99. In the current state of peoples pandemic budget, personally I feel it's WAY to expensive. Heck Goodnotes is $10 once with updates, am I missing something? Happy Planner $20 even..",poor
I was interested in this app until I had to put in my credit card for a free trial without even knowing the price.,poor
Don't like not being able to even look at the app without credit card entry and account sign up.,poor
I really like the app/online portal but having everything in one does me no good w/o push notifications & I wish this had a widget so I didn't have to open the app to look at everything.i paid for this & I don't feel like I got my investment back as I maybe use the app once in a blue moon. It looks great but it just doesn't work to what I feel is it's full protein. I hope you add this & don't make me pay for it.,poor
There is a subscription to the service. I wish i would have knownBEFORE I downloaded. Looks beautiful though.,poor
Its ok,poor
"Love it and it's good start to build on! But there appears to be syncing issues between calendars no matter how many times I refresh. I'm going to give it time before I give up on it. I'm big on my Happy Planner and would totally ditch it for this if it had similar features, such as a budget planner one could add. I wouldn't use most of the stickers, which is unfortunate because I love my stickers in my planners. Overall....good start?",poor
"Absolutely no mention of paying to use this app until you've downloaded it and signed up. Too bad, it looked pretty.",poor
"Okay if you like planning with Google. It's exactly like that, just prettier. I don't see how this can replace a paper planner at all.",poor
"Edited. Three stars because it could use some improvements (like ability to select text, cut/copy, and paste). It only gives the ""Select All"" option. Ability to drag items on lists (mobile) would be good too. These work fine on the web but not mobile. The app is gorgeous. Great sync with Google Calendar & visually pleasing, but too many glitches on my end, including web app (things not updating, making what you just typed disappear or not deleting when you try to delete). May retry in future.",neutral
"I have downloaded it on my Samsung tabs6, i have added an event to repeat, however it is not showing anywhere but search bar. Much frustration. Also cannot get it to work on macbook like tutorial in app store. Can someone possibly help?",neutral
"Uhmm...hello creator... I just want to ask when I opened the app, it glitches and it will turn back to my home. Please fix this thank you",neutral
"Very tempting appl, the the theme is geat, however, using preset handwriting styles might be a bit risky.",neutral
I am currently in the free trial period. I have been in constant contact with Tech Support as my calenders wont sync. Technology support have been wonderful but too difficult for me to sort out with the time differences. The app on the mobile is slow to update changes. I love the colours and writing but functionally it is a bit sluggish for the price. I am still considering continuing once the trial is over but not sure.,neutral
"I'd give it a 5 if it had some additional features like the ability to search your notes by hashtags or keywords. Also; it works with my Note 8 but writing on the screen is a little clunky, it could be easier to write on screen.",neutral
So far I love the layout and look... I'm not giving it 5 yet but will update as I use it more... I don't like that if I click on my notification that it opens the event to save or delete I stead of just looking at it or giving me the option to complete. My other issue is not being able to change the time I want an all day reminder. Again I love it so far but would like to see that changed.,neutral
why can't i get it to open up on my chromebook? it stays in a phone format...so disappointed,neutral
"The app needs reminders for appointments. I like the stickers, but need more variety.",neutral
It needs the ability to put stickers on the priorities and tasks. Also needs push notifications for reminders of events. It's essentially just a pretty google calendar with less customization and automatic features.,neutral
🌷🌷🌷 I'm used to Goodnote best app Ever. ArtAgenda is 3 star for me. can be better but not worth paying R580 a year. is too much..😱,neutral
"I'm really glad someone is making an app like this, but it feels like a very early version and it makes more sense to have a kickstarter instead of subscription if you need the cash for primary development. Loads more customization is needed, including a) allowing uploads for your own artwork for cover/theme b) ability to add/delete the modules you need (delete at least - I don't track water so it's a waste for me) and c) landscape mode. I plan to follow development though and good luck!",neutral
"Downloaded it because I love that it has a weekly, monthly and daily goal views, also lists and water intake goals but it doesn't have push notifications and it seems like I can't cross off events, only goals or tasks and that's a huge deal at least for me so it would be great if you guys can make that happen",neutral
It would be good if it was a free app. I understand in app purchases but only if the app itself was free.,neutral
"I just got this app about 2 days ago. I love it! I would give it ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ... if the developers added new features such as: *more affordable $20/year *more stickers: love variety *journaling pages : customizable to be added anywhere within the planner *fully customizable upcoming event pages: to help plan for weddings, anniversaries, birthdays, graduations, parent to be planning & baby or adopted child showers, Valentine's, marriage proposal 😊",neutral
"Great concept the idea of this is great but theres a couple things that need work and i have a few ideas app is very slow or laggy. Sometimes it wont let me click on the sugested address. Also would be useful to be able to click address in planner and pull up directions in google map, i would also like to be able to link a list to a event and or address would also like to be able to ""build my desired layout ,more themes and stickers",neutral
"Needs a widget! Once it has multiple different widgets, calendar, to do list, grocery list...etc I might revisit it.",neutral
Love your hard work. But it's there a widget? With the calendar open?,neutral
"There were a lot less options for handwriting, covers, and stickers than I anticipated for something you want me to pay an annual or monthly subscription for. It's a great concept but the execution fell short for me.",neutral
I like this better then the calendar that comes on my phone but it's too pricey. I dont mind paying for an app I like or paying for the downloads I want in an app but you cant justify this price for what you get.,neutral
Love it so far. Wish it had a widget for Android though.,neutral
"I wanted to play with it for a few minutes before putting in my payment info. I realize I can cancel, but would prefer to do a quick test first. I",neutral
"I think this is a great start to a product. I would love to see more features. Specifically features that let you link between lists and the planner sections, features that let you have subordinate lists, save information from a website or even be able to create a task or a goal directly from your email or a website.",good
I had just downloaded the app on my phone and wasn't able to log in on my PC. I contacted customer service who we were quick to answer and very friendly. Having used it I am pretty much in love. It makes me feel like I am holding a paper planner in my hands. The only thing I would want to add is a place to log my physical activities. Other than that I am in love.,good
"I just downloaded this app and already love it. The themes and fonts are so cute and the modules for lists is amazing. I am pleased with the agenda and monthly widget options for my android as I like to use one full screen on my phone for a monthly calendar widget view. It is disappointing, however that stickers aren't visible on the widget view. The stickers allow me to identify categories of events quickly and clearly, and without them it just looks like google calendar.",good
"Amazing agenda except that it doesn't have a habit tracker included, if it did it would of been perfect",good
"I have a love hate relationship with this app. Hate because sometimes I can't open the app for days on end and customer service just completely ignores you. Love however, because they add amazing features and new fonts/covers regularly. It is a beautiful and functional app. It is indeed beautiful and syncs well between my husband's gmail calendar and artful agenda. I hope the last few bugs get fixed soon.",good
Really enjoying using this planner and now my lists and tasks can repeat it is slowly replacing my old calendar and to-do apps altogether.,good
"I've only had this planner a day, but so far I love it. I need to be organized and have several calendars, including a paper calendar, but can never find a digital one I like. I love being able to customize the look. I also like the menu option, as I usually write my menu in my paper planner and on a wall calendar. It's nice to see on my computer or desktop and keep track of for shopping. I'll update when I've used it for longer, but so far I really enjoy my first impression.",good
I really like this app so far. I've been using it a week now and it does everything I need it to do. I normally use the Astaire bullet journal method with a rolling weekly task list. But im still able to make a weekly task list and assign tasks to certain days. I can also migrate the ones that don't get done. I will certainly keep this app and don't mind the subscription because it works so well for me! I'll check back in again in a few weeks.,good
"Great so far. I recommend having the lists saved offline since I went to the grocery store & there was no signal so my list didn't load. That was inconvenient. I use it for priority tasks for the day, meal plans and different colors & stickers.",good
I really really like it. Simple to use and it seems to be syncing ok. Love the colors and how it looks in my windows 10 browser. Look forward to updates like new stickers in the future.,good
"Updating to 4 stars because push notifications are now live.. Not Fully Developed. This app could be great, but in their rush to put it out, the features are highly lacking. No push notifications, you cannot upload stickers, no widget, pretty buggy. I really liked the idea of it, but it needs improvement. I will update to 5 stars if and when these features are added. They did reach out to me to resolve my issues, so I am updating to three stars.",good
"Love the app ... was able to download it to my iPhone. I went to download it to my Samsung tablet. BUT once I hit open, all I get is black screen. I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it several times and it still won't work",good
"Plz ???❤1.Widget that shows the current date, list of upcoming events, 1 click option to open calendar 2.Ability to set reminders/alerts for scheduled events 3. Ability to sync to phone's stock calendar (Android) 4.Additional settings ability to customize the color of the circle indicating current date 5. Ability to actually see the inspirational quotes in the app even if a new tab was necessary 6.Ability to create tasks and designate their priority as high, low or routine along with the option",good
Could use more fonts and options and a habit tracker. But it's a great start.,good
Love the look of this agenda. List feature is great way to track & complete to do lists!,good
I love the concept & look of this mobile app & the desktop version. I wish I could set recurring tasks or add time reminders to tasks. You also can't set reminders if you add an event directly into Artful Agenda. You have to add it to your Google calendar first to set the reminder then let it sync to Artful Agenda. I've paid for the year subscription & I'm really hoping it has more functionality by the end of my subscription or I won't be renewing.,good
"Like the app, but wish it had widgets to be able to see calendar at all times",good
"I love this app! It makes my day to day so much more organized and pretty. It allows you to keep a check on your daily water intake, your to do lists, grocery lists, events, whatever you have in mind! I find that the layout of it all helps me to maintain productivity. I only wish there were a widget available!",good
"I live this calendar app, but I wish it was a widget.",good
So far I really like it. when will the stickers and tablet features be ready?,good
just installed Love that syncs with google. Wish the mobile app allowed Screen rotation. Wish I could Zoom on the week a month view. I understand mobile i in beta. Looking forward to the evolution.,good
"Love it so far! I would like to be able to move appointments around on the same day. for example, they are listed in the order you enter them. But I want my am on the top of each page and my p.m. appointments in the afternoon on the month view. it would be great if you can just drag and drop. I also would like a printing feature for my lists so that I can actually print them out while packing.",good
so far so good,good
Love it! I hope we get more stickers but its great.,good
"Great app - on a tablet. However, I have one issue. When I create a repeated task, say to repeat daily, when I check it completed the first time, all subsequent days are checked complete. This defeats the purpose of creating a repeating task. Hope you guys can fix it! Love the service.",good
YOUR LIFE WILL BE CHANGED BY THIS APP! I have always used paper planners. I've also used digital planners. I also have my digital calendars. This app takes all of those platforms and makes a beautiful pastry! You need a list? They've got lists! And stickers! Really. It's a no brainer,good
"I love this app and have (almost) been converted to digital rather than a paper planner (and that's purely because I enjoy spending afternoons designing and stickering a paper planner). I love the stickers and the changeable covers. I also love that you can pick 'handwriting.' I've been using it for a few months now and am paying but so far there's been no problems with it and it gets up dated with new stuff regularly. Whether you prefer using a digital planner or not, get this, you'll love it!",good
"This is the best purchase I've made this year. I love planners but this one is my favorite. I can organize on my laptop and take it to go with my phone. It's cute and pretty, and there are so many cover options. The whole thing syncs with Google calendar and I love that about it. If you're on the fence, take a risk, you won't regret it! 😁",good
"I love this planner! I finally feel like I am truly organized. The widget feature is amazing because I am easily able to see what's on the agenda. The push notifications are great! I have this on my phone, laptop, and tablet. Plus it is so cute!!!",good
User friendly! All the things I look for in a paper agenda...now on my phone.,good
Tip top! Customer service great! Just a bit expensive...,good
"Love this app so much. I used to be a Happy Planner person, but it took to much work to make things pretty before functional. This agenda puts everything at my fingertips, plus has beautiful layouts and stickers. So many great features. I am a digital agenda convert thanks to Artful Agenda",good
"I had 2 digital and 2 paper calendars before Artful Agenda; not anymore! Artful Agenda combines the best of paper -- visual, attractive, stickers, and colors -- with the best of digital -- space for everything, invite others, link to video, directions, viewing all of your calendars together or view just one, always available, and of course REMINDERS! The annual subscription is less than most yearly planners but allows you to plan years out, if you want. Try it!!",good
I stumbled upon this site as an ad popped up on my Instagram feed... normally I would scroll past but something caught my eye and I'm so very glad that I followed the link.  I signed up instantly as I too have been searching for something less mundane and more customisable than Google Calendar and this meets all my expectations just perfectly. I am telling all my friends and just bought my Mum a subscription for her birthday as she'll love it! Thank you for inventing it. You've made my year.,good
"This app is perfect! I've been looking for a great digital planner that I can sync on everything. I have an Android as a personal phone, iPhone for work, Mac for personal laptop, and PC for work. For suggestions, I would like more sticker packs, a habit tracker, and finance section. Great job!",good
"I really love this app. I am a planner loyalist, and have planners and journals for everything, the only thing I would love to see is the ability to turn the pages. Like on Google Playbooks. And other planners. I hope this feature will be added soon. Thanks Katy, for a great job on putting this together ❤",good
"THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!! Roll over incomplete task with an automatic default is EXACTLY what I needed!!!! (I love the new covers too, but holy cow, this feature is LIFE CHANGING!!!!)",good
"I love AA! I mostly use the list options that are available. They have helped me manage my time better and give me a place to keep up with all those ""To-Do's"" that always pop up!",good
The BEST agenda ever!! LOVE THIS APP!,good
"This is EVERYTHING I've been looking for! The price is reasonable considering the amount I spend on paper journals and supplies, it actually probably saves me... The response from reps is amazing. Sure, there's more room for improvement but you can absolutely see the work they are doing and the ears they have on their customers to continue rolling out new features that we ask for. I can't wait to see how much better it continues to get. I'm in love!",good
"I tried this app a long time ago, and it's come so far! I'm using it to replace an analogue bullet journal, and it has nearly everything I need now! Maybe the only thing missing would be the option to insert pictures into lists, to keep track of hand-drawn diagrams and stuff. Otherwise, I love it!!!",good
This is a fantastic app and well worth the money! I have been using it now for 2 months and it has replaced my paper planner I never thought that would be possible. If you're debating on getting it they have a free trial period to help show how amazing it truly is.,good
"Absolutely loving electronic planner. I've been looking for something that fits what I need for AGES and once it has recurring tasks,it will have everything I need 😍 I've contacted support a few times and the response is really quick and resolves queries at first attempt.",good
"This Agenda has changed my life. I can easily switch between family, business and personal calendars. I can color code events and the tasks lists have made my followups in business, and my daily home tasks seamless. Im no longer the mom losing my mind (as much anyway). I HIGHLY recommend!!!!",good
I really like this app and I'm stoked to hear about upcoming updates that will be game changing. This app is just what I'm looking for. A functional and attractive agenda to replace my physical planner,good
"The developers of this digital planner have done a wonderful job! I feel like Goldilocks and the 3(00) planners because I've tried so many before this. THANK YOU for making this multi platform accessible... that is the reason I was able to sign up! I cannot wait to see what other features and development you do, but for now I am really happy with the great mix of function and design.",good
"I don't do ""free trials"" where my credit card information is mandatory to try it out first Edit:. Still don't like the above but I have to say the app is about perfect for me in every way. It's everything I could ask for in a planner app, and I love that it also integrates with Outlook. It's brilliant and worth the money",good
Love how functional and pretty this planner is! I paper plan but this is perfect for on-the-go.,good
🖤IT,good
This app is adorable but i'll never really use it. Its too bland. Great colors and styles just not enough to keep me interested.,good
"Exactly what I needed, feels fancy like a paper planner but syncs perfectly with online calendars!",good
"Where do I start. I'm a paper planner addict, but I work in the Healthcare Field and can't bring all pens, stickers, and other paraphernalia. I cannot believe I can work on my schedule from my laptop and it immediately transfers to my phone. I'm floored. What a great thing, not to mention it's only going to get better as time goes! It gives me a bit of peace and calm to work on my planner during the day, thank you Kate!",good
Love this app!! I'm much more organized with it!,good
Obsessed.,good
This is perfect. I'm able to get all of my family calendars in one place without having to lug around a traditional agenda. Also they are wonderful at fixing any issues and responding to all emails.,good
I love all of the features. Especially the lists and the stickers.,good
"Super cute & functional! It syncs with both my personal (google) and work (outlook) calendars, space to plan priorities and meals (weekly/daily views) and LISTS! I don't use the stickers as much, but all the colors for events and background are enough for me right now. Can't wait for the widget to come out someday!",good
Love this app!!! It's so easy to use. It helps me be organized with the option of having multiple lists. Plus....it's colorful!!,good
"I absolutely LOVE this app! I am a very OCD person when it comes to being organized and love my planner but really wanted something digital...very portable and environmentally friendly... I found it here! I love the way it syncs in seconds across my devices, phone, iPad, Google home device, and laptop. It’s super user friendly and very customizable! I tried several other digital planners and this one beats them hands down!",good
LOVE THIS APP!! This app had saved me so many stressful headaches!! The creator is ALWAYS on top of it and so helpful with everyone's questions. Install this app - you won't be sorry!,good
It's a beautiful digital calendar that u can customize with a cover and stickers and fonts - so much prettier than the standard calendar that comes on your phone!,good
"Love, love, love this app!! I have been a paper planner lover for 30 years and I just switched to Artful Agenda and I couldn't be more pleased. Try it, you'll love it!!!",good
"I have thoroughly enjoyed my AA ever since I found out about last year! I had been looking for an organizer that I use as a calendar and to handle my many ""things to do"" lists. Thank you Katy for your vision and concept.",good
"I normally don't review apps, but this one is amazing. This digital planner was exactly what I wanted. Give it a try, you won't regret it.",good
"This app is beautiful, and has really helped me keep my business, large family, homeschool and church activities all in order! No more chaos for this girl!",good
"The perfect marriage of pen & pixel. If you love the features and visuals of a paper planner but stink at keeping up with it, this is for you. It allows me to: -sync to my Google calendars, & color code -switch an event from one Google calendar to another which even Google calendar won't let me do -look at my schedule as a single day, week, or month without having to put items in 3 different places -set and write down goals -track water & meal plan -make lists -check off tasks",good
"Fun cover, stickers and layouts.",good
"So I love this app- I think it's perfect for what I needed, at the time. Sadly my job changed and so did my need for a calendar/planner. Artful Agenda was still great but I found myself no longer using the stickers or really having time to add information to it. I canceled my subscription- they were super easy to work with. I still recommend this app to girls when asked - ❤❤ I love and miss Artful agenda. When my job changes again I'll be back.",good
"Perfect, I'm loving every element so far ,I love that I can at some point once it's all done use it like my paper planner and sync them with my phone, I hate carrying my paper planner and also having to update my cell calendar , I love and cant wait to see and use all the coming soons I'm so excited ,I'm hoping also a widget will be something to come soon as well so that I can have it open on my phone and not always have to open the app for quick reference. Keep it up",good
Awesome app!!!,good
"Love it so far! Excited for the ""coming soon"" items. I use a paper planner bc digital planners never seem to have the layout I want but so far this seems to be a great replacement!",good
i am loving this and plan to buy it. do you intend to add a widget for phones and tablets?,good
"Omg just what I've been looking for and you can also have it on a desk top so whenever I'm working and can't reach my phone for booking clients this comes in handy, can't wait to see what is coming soon 😍😍 Edit: I went on the computer to see if there is a major difference and OMG there is I totally love the desktop site I cannot wait for more features to come I totally recommend this app to anyone🥰🥰🥰 so in love",good
great app. love it,good
This app is literally like a dream come true. It is girly and has all of the things a paper planner has but electronically. I love it!,good
"I've been a paper planner girl for years! I need the pretty colors and stickers. While I still have a paper planner (that hasn't been touched for months) I needed something on my phone because with 3 kids spaced 6 years apart, we are busy. We homeschool year round as well as appointments and family stuff. Artful Agenda fits everything I need. Update on the fly and it's PRETTY! I keep a tab open on my desktop as well as the app on my phone. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",good
"Amazing planner! I've been using the desktop version linked with my Google calendar and it was working great! Now with the app, it's even better than I thought it would be! I love having all of my appointments in one place and it's so easy to use! I especially enjoy the extra feature of being able to add notes to my tasks! It has helped me stay on task with work, cleaning, and everything else!",good
The best yet!,good
"My Planner system is now complete! I love the web app and now with the mobile app, my on-the -go planning is also on point. The app is fast, beautiful and a perfect planning companion. Awesome!",good
"I never thought I could switch to a digital planner and yet here I am, my husband is so happy to see everything that used to take him time sifting through my calendar. We're all synced up on Google calendar now and i have the beautiful version for me to see on Artful Agenda with the lists I need to run my box and family!",good
"This app is practical, beautiful, fun, and easy to use! Highly recommend!",good
"I just ADORE this app. It has saved my sanity on more than one occasion. Super simple to use and I love being able to color code things. And the water tracker, my goodness.",good
love love love this!!!! its the best of both worlds - paper and digital and syncs with all your calendars ! awesome app!,good
love it. Cant wait for it to do even more.,good
Finally something that lets me feel like I'm using a paper planner but I don't accidentally leave it at home!,good
This is my dream calendar app! It works perfectly with my Google calendar while also offering list making capabilities as well as meal planning! As a mom and business owner it gives me everything I need in a digital calendar!,good

Best app but the phone works slowly after downloading this app. I have noticed many times,poor
Old version is better.. in new version cannot backup without premium membership... I am going to uninstall,poor
"1st time installation and i can't select my reminder alarm time to AM. Just stuck at PM, uninstalling ASAP. Bye",poor
Good...was using it. But now will have to leave it..coz todo backup & move to other phone have to subscribe to there monthly payment plan. Tata bye bye,poor
bad. no alarm or notification coming,poor
"I just like it, convinient",poor
Became unusable. After a few months,poor
"Terrible experience. If you forget to acknowledge a recurring task when it reminds you, it will no longer send reminders for that task. Randomly changes ""remind me when due"" selection to ""do not remind me"". In one week, with 4 tasks per day, it has failed to remind me 9 times. Absolutely useless! ETA: AFTER THE DEVELOPERS REPLY, I checked my power saving and HAD NONE ACTIVATED. DO NOT BELIEVE HIM. DO NOT BUY!",poor
The alarm option is not alarming at the time i set up a task.... So sad... I thought i found the right app for all my task,poor
Bad design makes making to do lists a monumental task,poor
I hav installed just a day ago and you see how when I set alarm for today it didn't even work and ring 😑... It's just a normal app with no alarm..I hate this app 😑,poor
Good,poor
It was good on first day...but it did not remind me. Not even the first day. Worst app ever used. 👎👎🙅🙅🙅😖😖,poor
"Subscription only!!! You were sarcastic first, with your remark about me wanting everything for free when I never said that or even implied it. So you stop being sarcastic/rude and stop bothering me also and I'll stop bothering you. If you don't want people to be rude then don't be rude to them. Subscription only!!!",poor
Not getting notification or reminders of my tasks,poor
The reminder for recuurring tasks is not working.,poor
"I was so happy about this app. To my big disappointment, after I lost a lot of time to set my tasks and to prioritize, I had the very unpleasant experience to have all the tasks deleted, also the name of the list and no possibility to recover. I do NOT recommend it.",poor
this app not sending me any notification.,poor
Bed application,poor
Worst app,poor
Does not repeat every two days as set. Pretty damn useless. Uninstalled.,poor
"Very confusing, only the creator knows...",poor
"I missed something very important because this app didn't notify me. The phone ran out of battery in the night - the reminder was set to 8am - and I turned on the phone at 9am. Apparently, to this app, that means to just not tell me that the reminder was supposed to go off. Garbage. This literally didn't do the one most important thing it's supposed to do.",poor
Confusing,poor
Not user friendly. Almost impossible to delete or edit lists. Format is garbage.,poor
Too complicated,poor
It is confusing.. I ws looking forward to get a list of tasks so tht I can mark it done or not done. 2nd review after receiving feedback from Dev. Steve: Steve I think I don't hv tht much time to personally write to u and I guess thts why play store has review system. I hope this helps. Thnks. If possible try to b polite to ur future customer.,poor
Useless app. It dint give any notification.,poor
No alarm/reminder 🙄,poor
Not working,poor
I have one old version backup file and now it is not getting restored. Please help,poor
"This app is ridiculous. You can't delete tasks, move the sub tasks around, modify, or makes notes as the project evolves. It's not intuitive. Essentially I had to write out my list on a piece of paper to build the order. Once it was correct then enter it to this app, which makes this app pointless. Must be the free version's nuisance features driving you towards the paid version.",poor
Useless app... Niether Reminder nor notifications ping... Wasted too much time on ficing issue.. Even followed developer's instructions..,poor
How is it possible to be unable to restore my data?,poor
I'm struggling with this app. I'm trying so hard to like it but there are basic things that I want it to do that it doesn't seem to be able to do. 1: It doesn't seem to be able to set a reminder for a whole list to alert me during any particular day. Instead I seem to have to set an alarm for each task which means that I would have alarms going off all day. That would drive me insane! 2: It isn't possible to contact the developer through the app. Quite bizarre!,poor
"Looked at the reviews for a solution but The app dev just blames the phone (it's never the same phone) for causing the app not to work. I'm having the same problems of the alarm for a task not going off, not even a notification. Blaming the phone when you so it's not just one device is lazy.",poor
"Snoozing and recurrence behave erratically, thus alarms often don't happen when they should. Developer did support, separately and only up to a point, issues with notifications which are specific to my device.",poor
"Use Google Tasks! It's much better and FREE 🥳 You have to subscribe £1.50 a momth to get full use of this 🤣🤣🤣🤣 It's a basic reminder app. Had it have been a one of payment of a tenner then I'd have brought it but I hate it when you have to subscribe, especially for something so basic as this. They do it so you subscribe and forget about it. Just greed.",poor
"Unresponsive widget, did not work at all on my phone.",poor
"## You ""reaching out"" has not, in any way, addressed the question I asked, I'll uninstall. Thanks anyway. ## * Rather disingenuous response. When doing a local backup it informs the user that Manual backup ""will be removed in a future version"". Why would I continue using it if I will not be able to to do a local back up my data at some point ""in the future"" ? * I don't use the ""cloud"" so this will be useless to me if I can't backup locally.",poor
"2nd Edited review: The app is worst for reminders since it takes many minutes to fire. Which simply means, the app is worthless. Now the customer service told me that I'm using a cheap device, when in fact it i m using a premium budget phone. Bulls**t customer service as well since they clearly can't take the blame like a real man/woman. Bunch of frauds n scammers tryna make their customer buy their failed invention. Go fu*k urself customer service! Good luck selling nud*s coz u failed it here!",poor
"Mr. Stephen today i setted my daily schedule with remainders on this app. But any single remainder didn't rang with alarm, It doesn't notified me about my tasks & schedules.",poor
I'm better with myself nowadays. Cheers,poor
Alarms and notification is not working ...even after battery optimization being disabled...checked all the settings,poor
Thr notion of paying a monthly fee for this is laughable. I will stick with Todoist for a fre more bucks a month.,poor
Confusing and clunky.,poor
Updated and now no longer sends the task again set to daily if you dismiss the notification.,poor
"Absolutely useless, worked once then never again. Am now living in amonst my household waste like stig of the dump 👍🏻",poor
"Unable to restore,app version mismatch? I just download the app and then i make a backup copy then, uninstall and restore it back again and that what it says. Please do fix it and also make some Auto backup or Auto save features",poor
I tried it and didn't like it. It wasn't as easy to use and more complicated than needed to be.,poor
It is given reminders,poor
No reminder for tasks,poor
Sir plzzz ad some more option like Upcoming task and DONE TASK SO THAT I CAN SEE ALL DETAIL ABOUT MY UPCOMING PROJECT AND HISTORY IN SEPRATE OPTIONS OBOUT THIS And add repeat option until i will not stop or snooz the task Some time i m not able to see my mob. So if it will repeat automatically after some duration until i am not select any option And yes i know there is option about repeat i am talking abour different one like auto until i will not choose any option,poor
Unable to share to do list with another account,poor
Have been paying for premium each month for several months now and now it's not syncing across devices and its telling me to upgrade to premuin on both fone and 2nd device when iam paying for premium (pathetic)... Canceling subscription and uninstalling!,poor
Very poor application.... Repeating reminder not working...useless app,poor
"It does'nt work at all. No alarm,no notification nothing at all even after going thru all the settings. Just wonder how your app get its 4.7 rating.",poor
"**UPDATE**. I uninstalled this app. It now causes my phone to crash when I reboot-which is everyday. *******I downloaded this app because the other app I was using wouldn't always notify me. Also, they recently decided to change from an analog clock face to having to scroll (similar to a digital clock) to set the due time. I tested this app before I started copying all my tasks, but I came across a problem. When creating a repeat, there is no way to set it to do a certain day of the month (ie: the 3rd Saturday of the month, or the Last Sunday of the month). This is a big issue for me because I have certain things I want to do, but it's not always on the same date of the month. Hopefully, this can be added/changed soon.",poor
Dose not work,poor
Just a list app. You can't do anything else unless it's on a list.,poor
Too complicated and time consuming to set a task. No way to repeat on a monthly basis and specific day of the week at the same time. Not worth the time it takes to use it. Uninstalling.,poor
When i set to remind me daily it shows even in past and it doesn't remind me kindly let me know the way to set it proper,poor
Why isn't this app getting downloaded There is some issue with the app It had been recommended to me by my buddy but this thing isn't getting installed on my phone,poor
Why was I charged $1.49 for this app? I was charged 2/4/2020.,poor
"Monthly payments for a todo app? Not gonna happen, thank you.",poor
Too hard to use,poor
Lag all the time,poor
What should I do if I want more sublists ?! There is no way ! 🙁,poor
Scheduling reminder intervals does not work!!!!,poor
This app just isnt for me,poor
Usless,poor
Can only put 5 tasks before having to pay,poor
I just removed this app! I missed several events in the last couple of months because it did not notify me!!!!!,poor
Subscription only. No outright purchase. Too bad. Seems like a nice app.,poor
Used it until simple backup was premiumized. Restore wont work between different versions unless you modi-hack the file. Author would not tell you that you can do it though if you ask his help ! . Restore dont recognize my backup file at all so all my lists are basically inaccessible now. Will never install this again and I suggest anyone who values his data not to !,poor
Very pricey,poor
"Has no sign in option only export and the file won't open, so unless you have an IT friend you lose your file which meant all the stuff I put in tasks has gotten lost. If the developer revolves this is I will edit this review.",poor
The alarm doesn't work,poor
"Definitely I appropriate your hard work and this app different from all those big guys apps, but question is if someone lost the phone or uninstalled the app, what is the purpose this app?, So i'm just suggesting, > you can limit the how many task can be added by users without premium >Opt. In Ads for auto backup",poor
"I deleted a list but I still get alarms for one of the tasks in that list, even after restarting my phone.",poor
"Dont work, the best it got was the vibration notification worked. I can't get any sound at all from this app.",poor
"I removed this paid app. I missed about a dozen events over the few months I owned this. I would look at the app a few minutes after an event was supposed to pop up, and it showed that it had missed. I'm trying out Simple Calendar, which testing seems to work better.",poor
Need to make more convinient I just set 3 time alarm for the task but it didnt work,poor
I cant even get on thing on the opening page much less start a list??,poor
Bad,poor
A simple app that could not be more complicated to operate.,poor
No hourly reminder.,poor
This app is not the best.,poor
"💩👎💩👎💩👎💩 👻☠️ IMPOSSIBLE TO DELETE LIST, OR SUB LISTS (TABS)!!! ☠️👻 REGRET v2.0 UPGRADE!! 👎💩👎💩👎💩👎💩👎💩👎💩👎💩👎💩👎💩👎💩👎💩👎💩👎💩👎💩👎💩👎💩👎",poor
"Absolutely terrible. Most unless app I have downloaded, to date.",poor
Always missing the notifications even when it is not optimized and restricted in background.,poor
No good,poor
Only get about half of the reminders,poor
"Awful hard to start, impossible to figure out",poor
"Would be nice if you could import tasks from other applications, but not only is that a problem, but importing from a previous version of Tasks is impossible too? Nevermind. I'll just stick to what I got.",poor
"Edit: I'm using this application many year since release. And i'm loved it and donate, Now you make this application subscription $15 a year? Really?? Not happy with that...",poor
"I do not like the functionality of the app. I found it is very easy to delete a sub list. But if you create a second list I could not figure out how to delete it after going through all settings. I also did not like the fact that you can only add one item within the sub list. Other people may be okay with these nuances, but for me it's not. I only use this app for about a half an hour and then deleted it.",poor
Recurrent tasks don't work,poor
Not good. Wasted time.,poor
Can't rely for reminders. No alarm comes even if I select Alarm. Because of relying on this app I missed an important task.,poor
"there are better and simple other apps which provide automatic online sync or backup feature like Micr_oso_ft's to do, and many other. why people think this app easy, it's not. I donated on this app and wasted.",poor
Over complicated,poor
Extremely unintuitive.,poor
"Garbage. The one time I can't remember if i checked the notification for taking my medication or not, there was no way to go and see which days I checked it or not. What's the point of that?",poor
"Dear developers, thank you for deleting all my reminders after updating the app! It was not pleasant at all, believe me!",poor
Loved for a while. One fine day my subtasks got deleted. It was in a task for which i didn't set any due date. Bad experience.,poor
Don't use this unless you sync your tasks. The backup and restore functionality from one device to the next is bad.,poor
It'hs just too complicate to use for me,poor
pangit,poor
Too complicated,poor
"Was really enjoying this & then the notifications just stopped which is a big part of what I needed the app for:( annoying, finding a new app for this now",poor
Terrible app,poor
Worst apk reminder not work,poor
Doesn't sync to calendar,poor
Well it's broken now. I haven't messed with any settings in or out of the app and now there's no alarm. It just vibrates. I checked and it all still has the alarms and correct sounds yet it only vibrates when it shows a reminder. Why do these reminder apps always break?,poor
"Used to work ok, now, something is skrewy. Now, if I restart my phone, EVERY SINGLE task comes up as a notification, never mind of when the tasks were/are due, and the schedule I set. Now, after I dismiss tasks, they pop up again, ignoring its schedule. Also, wish app could remember which day the task is for. If you have a daily task that you complete after midnight, it thinks you completed it early and won't remind you later that day. Finally, wish app opened to an overview of all lists.",poor
Nice good,poor
"How can one trust an app that is supposed 2 help organize, when u misspell ""Organize.""",poor
doesn't allow you to do a Samsung back up and restore,poor
"Doesn't have a built-in backup and even after exporting a backup file - an error shows up. Additionally, the support email is an invalid email address. A total waist of time for setting it.",poor
i don't want to name EVERYTHING!!!!!!😣😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠,poor
it was great until it disappeared. Very unhappy that I lost the app and ALL my info.,poor
"It doesn't ring the alarm at the right time. only when I open my phone, it starts ringing. useless for me because I want it to ring at the right time and remind me on my realme phone. Highly disappointed! :(",poor
I don't get a notification or any alarm after i set the due date reminder at all. I've already tried a couple of times how do i fix this. My settings also allow notifications for the app. Also how do i set widget on home screen thanks.,poor
it doesnt do any thing its gliched everytime i open it,poor
I wanted a to do list.. this is not such.. continually asking to name things unnecessarily complicated ~ KISS,poor
"Too complicated, trying to add items to a list, it keeps trying to use the item names instead to make a new list or send the old list to this.",poor
When you try to write a task and you want to set the reminder at the same time you have to make a reminder for each one and its wasting my time. If I could I would rate this app 0 stars,poor
"When I share a list with someone over messenger or sms, just the name of the list is shared, not the actual list with an ability to collaborate",poor
Swipe to delete is terrible. Takes almost 5 swipes so work rendering the app useless.,poor
"after few months it started not checking the task. I mean I check and few hours later it is unchecked. it should be cleared and the next date for the same task should be displayed, example: task 1 to date 01/jan/2019 and repeat task 1 to date 01/feb/2019. after checking the task for January the task for February should be displayed, but after some time the task for January is unchecked.",poor
my mobile is getting switched off after installing.it worked fine on 1st day of installing. please fix it,poor
"too much setup. i just want to write my notes not title & subtitle everything! on the plus side, no permissions🙂",poor
I consider it as not easy to use.,poor
USELESS. SO CONFUSING TO USE. CANT SET SIMPLE REMINDERS,poor
Reminders are not showing notifications for the past 1 week to me sir .. 😢,poor
"Thought this was a great app until I realized it doesn't get rid of the ""checked"" daily tasks to remind you of the new daily tasks... and that is exactly what I was using this for... DAILY tasks I need done. When I check ""remove checked tasks"" it does NOTHING and those checked tasks just stay there. :(",poor
Terrible!!! I'm not getting the pre alerts I set or the reminders themselves. I go in to check on upcoming reminders & see outdated ones in red that never alerted me!!,poor
"I use it for awhile then deleted 👎 It is take more time to use than other Note Apps., confusing and have no reason to keep it ⭐ Many better Note Apps out there ⭐",poor
ive tried this app 2 times. Its great but everytime i use it it installs pop up adds all over my phone. As soon as I go to open one app their is an add...not cool. I deleted it for the 3 and final time.,poor
alarms and notifications don't work which is crucial to an organiser,poor
"Looked good, but wasn't. After installing Tasks, my keyboard stopped appearing for all my apps. It was only when I removed Tasks (as a last resort) that the keyboard appeared again.",poor
"Needlessly compicated for a to do list app. try to add a new item to your list and youll accidentally add a new list. try to swipe to switch between lists and youll remove an item from your list. What did you just remove? Hard to say, cant seem to find an undo option among the numerous other options.",poor
useless,poor
"app is awesome, but in this no login facility and assign task",poor
I settled an alarm on this app. But it never popped up. This looks like a great app but please fix this. All my notifications in this app is open.,poor
This app will not update nor uninstall properly. Fix it and I'll try it again.,poor
"at the beginning was good but i wait two months later and the app keep putting back as not done reminders that i mark as done already and the other task that have date and mark as priority don't even showed me, if you can fix that ill stay with the app otherwise i will keep looking... sadly the only remid app that work good was the apple one but i don't have iphone anymore so? came on please make this one work",poor
Unable to manage easily.. complicated,poor
"Date, no time.",poor
it was alright in the beginning but search bar disappeared after adding my tasks. guess there is bug who can't handle long task list. not recommending.,poor
Notifications only come up when you come app,poor
"I set a reminder to do a task daily at a certain time, however, this app does not retain the same time on the daily reminders. it will remind you and set the task to do but at an earlier time.",poor
Tried making a simple to do list. Was gone when I went back later,poor
App is very buggy. Completed tasks keep showing up as not completed. Notification alarm won't work. Uninstalling.,poor
Sucks,poor
I am not able to set the time . It is automatically taking the remainder timing,poor
NO INSTRUCTIONS I can't even get started because there are no instructions. I put in list title groceries and that's it when I try to make a list it asks for sub titles won't let me even start a list just sends ya in circles DELETE DELETE,poor
Hard to set up,poor
After a week my tasks never showed up. Completely stopped working 👍,poor
Does not work,poor
"Do not have the account sync feature, how we backup data when we change device ?!",poor
Doesn't even have a repeat feature,poor
It's takes a lot of space,poor
It's too difficult to understand,poor
"Downloaded the ap. Created a title for the list but then there wasn't any option of anything. The ""list"" disappeared and there were no instructions or help features to actually create the list items. The title vanished anx the s reen was lanm.couldnt then find the ""list"" anywhere...no list, no title, nothing. Stupid.",poor
Horrible it wouldnt even let me make a note,poor
The notificafions are not working,poor
"Can't Make Backups for Task Lists , This Feature is Paid, We Have to Buy Subscription Plan + Donate Atleast 100₹ for it. 😠",poor
It failed to notify me for the first time. I set up recurring monthly notifications for my bills and it was working perfectly. I'm two days late for a bill payment now.😣,poor
"Needs to be more user friendly , looked for a set reminder but could not find one , too many options for me .",poor
Horrible set up,poor
"Thank u, but what I actually want to know is what settings I must use to let the app pop up on the screen even if the screen is locked. Thanks.",poor
"Confusing!!, i want to like this app, but as an aspie, im finding it confusing to navigate, considering deleting 😥",poor
"Simple app with a fancy design. I like it in general, but what drives me nuts is a huge lagging when my mobile network and location service are switched on. Without it the app works almost smoothly. I don't know what data do you guys always gather from my phone, but I would appreciate some optimization on that",poor
"Paid for premium. Settings had reflected that I am using paid version up until the most recent update. Now it says ""Upgrade to Premium"". What is going on?",poor
"The backup feature does not work. I am stuck having to copy over 1000 items in my lists manually. I understand syncing is a premium feature, but the backup feature is not and I wish I hadn't bothered with this app in the first place. Edit: In response to your comment, my problem isn't the fact that I want premium features for free, it is the fact that I downloaded this app knowing that it had a free backup feature built-in, which is the main reason I chose this app. Your response shows a lack of professionalism, and frankly, maturity. The premium features do not include a back-up feature, but rather a syncing feature, which doesn't suit my needs. Your app is not the value of a free coffee. The premium features cost $20.99 for a subscription, not a one-time fee. The app accepts donations, but it's also for profit. The description of the app and it's features are misleading, and this is why I am giving you a negative review.",poor
Cyumbersome,poor
It’s not that good as much as I thought before I downloaded it. It never sent me notifications or alarms. I missed my two events because of this. 😭😭,poor
Nice app for remainders,poor
The app no longer reminds me of tasks and keeps bringing up ones marked complete.,poor
"Thanks, but it now has gone wrong being unable to alert and no alarm at all. Please advise if this app is still ok to keep!!!?",poor
This app sometimes missed important tasks and didn't notify.,poor
Not at all use ... Its not remainding with alarming then whats is the use of remainder app... Its only alarming while we open the app... Not usefull at all,poor
"Widget unresponsive. Boy, I am incredibly unlikely. I am the ONLY one to ever experience this! It must just be me.",poor
"There is no way to create repeated scheduled tasks. I already have Google calendar for what this does. Its nicer looking but I don't need what I already have. EDIT. in response: no it's not easy. And honestly, the app has so many more issues. Deleting things is difficult, but making mistakes in organization is easy. Organization is not great on this app. I don't like your app guys. I dont know who it's good for, but its not me. But I appreciate the slight on my post.",poor
Good 😶👏👍,poor
Terrible. I've missed so many reminders despite adding it to unmonitored apps and not being on power saver. I give up.,poor
Mlm,poor
My alarm isn't ringing please help. Everything else is fine,poor
"Loses task lists on Premium - Don't upgrade So annoyed. loved and recommended this app til I upgraded 2 weeks ago. Got a new phone & realised tasks weren't backed up to my GMail account (annoying). Copying the lists over wasn't easy either (annoying). Paid for the upgrade, have now lost 3 of my lists...vanished from menu. No reason, not deleted and not in deleted items. Can't find out how to sign out or cancel premium account. Use the basic option and don't change your phone!",poor
Go,poor
"Good idea for an app, but I uninstalled due to overcomplicated interface. For example, there are 2 ""+"" symbols, neither of which are self-explanatory (is it for a sub list of main list or another sub list category. I'd prefer there to be words there to explain what they mean and, additionally, a description of what list you're working under after you enter a list. I need an app that's unobtrusive but yet daily I can easily view my to do lists and subgoals.",poor
I like the Apple task app way better.,poor
"The star rating & my comment are only for the move capability. The order within the list can't be easily rearranged. Move to top and move to bottom is the only option. There's another move which tries to move the task to the same list if you have only one list. What is needed is a simple drag and drop of a task to a different order. The 2nd option is to have only 'Move' upon touch and hold, and then pop up a sub menu. This sub menu can have up / down arrow and other move choices.",poor
"It's just okay, it's too easy to delete tasks on accident and it puts it in backwards",poor
Feel like can add calender,poor
The 1st action the app wants is to name a list. What am I listing and why would I name it? What I'm looking for is a reminder with an alarm using the ringtones already on my phone to remind me of important events. This app doesnt seem to function that way. I dont know what I'd use this app for.,poor
Reminder notification not on time for about an hour so it is inconvenient,poor
"I loved this app at first, but now when I change my task dates/times, it doesn't actually change them, and continues to alert me at the original time even though I've clearly changed it. It's very annoying.",poor
No subscription tank you. Please full price. I no lack forever.,poor
While swiping towards right the tasks are getting deleted. At least it should ask for confirmation whether the delete is happening accidentally or we really want to delete.,poor
"YOUR CONDESCENDING ATTITUDE IS NOT HELPING YOR CASE. There is a sublist reorder but NOTHING for the MAIN LIST. THERE IS NO SORT OF ANY KIND says sort by DO DATE or lets you PICK WHAT TO SORT BY, A LOGIC CHOICE. Completed tasks NEED TO CHANGE IMIEDIATELY so you KNOW IT'S COMPLETED & next month IS SET.

Hard to use,poor
Useful.,poor
Too complicated to save and add.,poor
Had high hopes for this because it had everything I wanted but the completed tasks that I keep putting as completed come back the next day which is just irritating. Have tried all the settings to get of it but I can't and can't be bothered to persevere anymore,poor
why would tasks be tabs instead of a list? the whole screen is empty and you make us scroll tabs :O,poor
"I actually really like this app but one of the biggest features that needs to work properly for my routines is repeating reminders. I set reminds for monthly bills such as rent, and set it to repeat ""monthly"". But when I complete the task, it uncompletes itself the very next day WITHOUT setting the reminder to the next month. Basically if i set it to November 1st, it tries to remind me again, daily, on november 1st. It doesn't work. I love the app but the most important feature is broken sadly.",poor

It was okay but when I tried to set a reminder for 15 minutes from now it said reminders set in the past will not show. That is extremely inconvenient and annoying . I tried setting it for 15 minutes from now but didn't work. Would have given five stars if it wasn't for this issue,poor
"Tasks that repeat more than once daily dont work, if you have something that is twice a day you have to have two separate tasks. If you leave a task pending until the following day and complete it, it will never work again.",poor
Decent app but does NOT seem to be able to sync with my google calendar. Without that it is pretty useless to me. I like that sub-tasks are listed as an indent to the main task not as a seperate task.,poor
"I keep completing tasks, and the next day they open automatically again and the notification pops up. Its very irritating and confusing. What's the point of opening a completed task? Maybe you need to add an option to permanently close repeat tasks vs close them for that day",poor

"trying to switch from wunderlist and the import option doesn't work or give any assistance to troubleshoot. I just get the message ""file not found"" with nothing else to say where it's looking for the file so I can get it in the right place.",poor
i hate how you cannot open the app and see all your lists there. you have to have one open at all times and it does not show a list of your list on the home screen. deleting this app for this reason. too bad... the rest is great. but they need a home screen. they don't have one.,poor

not so good,poor
"Not competent at scheduling. Recurring tasks are automatically ""completed"" if not checked by the scheduled time. There is no way to know if you missed it. The interface is pleasant though.",poor
complicated,poor
I uninstalled the app because it sends my phone info to the developer,poor
"just started using it, but so far so good",poor
"simple app, widget is bad (left side has a bar that ruins symmetry, also you cant remove the new task button), also, why can I change list color but cant change button color? would also be cool to preview what ""compact/cozy"" and whatnot settings do instead of having to select them one by one, leave settings, and go back in to change them again. all in all, its almost a 5 star app, but the nuissances ruin the experience a bit.",poor
"Awesome app, the only missing thing is that you can only set a date, I would like to have buttons to remind me later on the day. Or on the next day, or next week. UPDATE: No what I meant, is that I want to say remind me today and not remind me at date today at specific time. UPDATE: I would then receive the notification, at a specific time 5 hours later or something that can be altered in the settings. And also I don't want to put in a date! Look at the app TickTick has exactly what I want. :)",poor
so far the app is great. would get 5 stars if it had a tabbing feature where you can side over to each task name instead of having to go to the menu button to switch.,poor
"it was pretty good on my old phone. then when everything was ported to my new one, the app came, but not the lists I'd made. what's the point of that?! I've deleted it.",poor

Can't put cute stickers on them no cuteness on phone,poor
"To Do list apps, like this one, are not useful without the capability of using recurring tasks. Too bad because the interface is otherwise well done.",poor
"Got it primarily for reminders. It has a lot of settings for how you want your alarms or notifications, but those are pretty useless when they don't work. Didn't get a single notification to remind me of the stuff I set up.",poor
No easy way to import/export tasks in a compatible format (e.g. Google Tasks),poor
"Liked the prioritization by dragging and the highlighting, but there does not seem to be a way to create recurring tasks. That's a deal -breaker for me. I'm uninstalling",poor

Checks it as done and then unchecks sometime at night with previous due date. 27 Oct 2018: After hearing back from the author, giving it another shot. Put two repeating tasks on it. See how it goes. 27 Oct 2018: This app didn't work as well for me. It would regularly uncheck tasks I'd completed or check tasks I'd not completed. The repeating task function didn't work well either.",poor
"Looking as everyone else's very +ve reviews. I seem to be the odd one out but I didn't find it straightforward. It is too easy to delete a list (on my S9 at least) with even a slight bit of a swipe. Once deleted it is lost. Why not have a 'back' or 'undo' button? Personally I don't find the heading, group, list structure particularly straightforward although I've now got used to it.",poor
Seriously? How did it get a 4.8? I can't even find an add button anywhere??? Unless i go to the top left corner? Nah. Not for me,poor
Without syncing to the cloud this todo app is unfortunately worthless. Love it otherwise and would have given it 4 or 5 stars. Please add sync since in my quest to find a good todo app this is the only one I've seen that doesn't sync anywhere between devices.,poor
I had a reminder set with a certain sound & it never went off,poor
Due Date is wonky. I made a few items on my list and the due will not change from the current day. The due date worked on other items. I don't need another app to work around.,poor

In this app reminder doesn't work,poor
It doesn't ring to notify me,poor
No Google tasks integration.,poor

daily.. You can basically create a list and then delete items as they are 
completed. That is all this does. Basically useless for anything other than 
a shopping list.",poor
No custom repeat frequency...,poor
"Dates and times? No such thing here Sure you can colorcode and organize and 
sort your tasks to death, but strangely enough there's no changing when a 
reminder will go off, no setting when a task is due (perhaps if you used 
this for work or a meeting), or not even the ability to set a due date for 
a task. It can be put in the details, but when time is of the essence 
you're better off using a better task app",poor
"It sounded good, so I installed it. My first task is an annual subscription 
reminder. This app doesn't offer an annual reminder so, yet again, I'd have 
to use two different apps for tasks. Why can't anyone get this right.",poor
Does this app truly have reminders?? It refused to remind me of my event,poor
"Was excited for this app. But the fact I can't change the notification 
alarm is a deal breaker.",poor
Please make it available as a widget.,poor
This was OK for a few days but now  when I open it it is just a blank screen and I have lost all my  tasks. Very annoying as these were important reminders !,poor

I don’t know why it missed some alarm. UI design is great. But i missed some imp task cause of this missed alarm prob,neutral
Everything is okay but it doesn't notify on time. I missed an important event because of this bug. I've used other apps on Play Store and all of them have the same problem. Some of them don't notify when the screen is locked. None of them are perfect. At times the app notifies me only after I open it.,neutral
Why google sync is not available?,neutral
I loved this app before but now for some reason notifications do not pop up and I'm missing out on really important reminders.,neutral
Is there not a way to open it on a desktop? Please add that feature Update: other apps offer the same feature without making you upgrade to premium - I rather see more ads than have to pay for that simple feature,neutral

Pretty good reminder app. The recurring reminders don't seem to work very well though. I'll get a reminder for the first occurrence and then nothing for any of the following events. There doesn't appear to be a way to acknowledge the original alarm without deleting it or marking the entire series as complete.,neutral
I love how simple the app is. I do wish it was more customizable. The background is just plain white. I'd like to add my own wallpaper to the background.,neutral

"I didn't have high expectations when I downloaded the app, especially based on this lame app icon (sorry but it's true). I really liked the functionality, I hope there will be more customization in terms of fonts, background colors, text colors, category colors, categories shown as a vertical or horizontal lists or general view - the app would be amazing. Also I would be willing to pay for this app when it's more customizable but ONLY a flat rate, I'm sick of subscriptions! The feel so forced!",neutral

I mainly use this for personal use, so I can totally understand that it would only allow for a certain # of people to share with, but... unfortunately no sharing at all.

Good app overall:) 2 Questions. 1st - Is it possible to change the checkoff color to anything else then yellow? (Why would it not be green by default??) 2nd - Why is it not possible to check off the subtasks within the widget?,neutral
"1. Since last update, going from one Sub list to another has become ""jumpy""; it seems to get stuck for a second half way through. 2. When new tasks are added to a sub list, they don't get the 6 dots on the right unless I sort. 3. Cannot select more than one task to delete in one motion. Yes, know I can swipe them, but that has proven not practical for me; call me error-prone, if you must. 4. There is no Feedback function. I imagine there is one hidden somewhere. Why?",neutral

"Is it true that non-premium version soon will loose any way for backup/restore or transfer to another phone? If not true: Please point to me what is the backup/restore way that stays in app in the future. Thanks a lot!. If true: That is really bad news - backup is a basic necessity, so non-premium version will become practically useless on the long term. In addition, premium costs twice as much for a single year than, let's say OsmAnd+ for eternity. And that is a much more complex app + the free version is completely usable within reasonable limits. Tasks is a really nice app (except that swichingt between sublists/lists is unreasonably slow) with some unique and essential features. But this wracks it, it will drive me away. Possibly others too. Not a fair move to reduce base functionality like that. RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S RESPONSE: That is fair enough, except for one important detail: all the people using your free app are now forced to decide - if they want to have a meaningful app - to pay or search for another app. Premium app should only add features and not restrict free app's capabilities. If you add worthwhile features with a fair pricing, people will buy it. Lots of people spent time to set up their tasking system because the app had the right properties for them, now it looks like they were lured into using the app and then forcing them to pay. I payed for a number of apps (all cheaper than yours btw.), and actually my plan was to pay/donate as soon as the slowness of switching between task lists disappear, because I thought the app is really useful and it deserves support. This change is different. I do not mean you should not ask for payment for cloud backup etc., just that you should not remove the free local backup (or any other feature). Or that you should have omitted it from the free version from the start. Best wishes! RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S SECOND RESPONSE: Actually you can clearly see from my review that I do not want everything for free. My problem is different. If we could not understand each other so far, perhaps it's not worth trying any more. So I won't comment on the rest of your answer. All the best!",neutral

Rather new to the app to rate it higher than a 3 at this time. But I like the results it is helping me to achieve.

"Very good app but something lacl There is options default task set today, Tommorow etc, one more problem when we ADD task in any list it automatically saved in other. Other when we add task any date it demand time necessary it shoud be Optinal",neutral
"I love the app, but you cannot add file to your task or schedule, this lack of ability to add file on such good app make it incomplete, I could have rated it 5",neutral
Excellent app,neutral
Expecting better. Need alarm facilty to remind me in advance.,neutral
Sufficient for my needs simple to use,neutral
"The app is helpful and has nice features. I would give 5 stars but you apparently you are not able to transfer your lists to another device, unless you have exactly the same version. I had to create all my lists from scratch.",neutral
Easy to use and keep my tasks in check. Love that I can have different sub tasks for different projects though i wish they could vbe color coded so as to differentiate them,neutral
"Seems laggy moving between lists and tabs after the latest update. No way to delete a parent list without manually deleting all sublists first? Edit: I see the delete option for subtasks, but how do you delete sublists and parent lists? (I understand it's a hobby project, and I appreciate that. Just making sure I'm not missing something.)",neutral
Looks good. But doesn't have web version. Would be 5 stars if I was rating author's dedication. Functionality wise can't give more than 3. The app is inferior to Any.do or microsofts todo,neutral
Lower rating until I use it more -just started,neutral
I have not been using app for very long. Therefore the 3 star rating. After some use I will return to rate again.,neutral
Enjoying the app.,neutral
It was good now alatm sound of tasks is full but sound is low only this app i have seperate alarm volume and its full,neutral
I just downloaded& installed this app. I was in search of an app that allows me to insert date and time stamp. Preferably using a button on the screen. This way I can time stamp different sections in my notes and activities. however I didn't find that feature. would love to see that in this app as it needs quite a few of my requirements.,neutral
"This app doesnt require your firstborn in order to function as similar apps do. The Quick post function is great. However, unlike other similar apps, this doesnt have a widget feature to show what the upcoming daily task is on the screen. So for me, that is really unfortunate. If this changes, I will gladly give this a perfect rating.",neutral
Nice but am looking for something that can synchronize with Google Tasks,neutral
"Sound now works but when I have the phone's Do Not Disturb feature on my wake up alarm task notifies but no sound. I have it set to ignore Do Not Disturb and have it set to alarm. My other alarm app does sound off during this time but not as reliable as Task, so it's not my phone causing no sound issue, what else could it be Stephen? You get it working and you get 4 stars, restore still does not work, gave up on that.",neutral
Good app for task but should be linked with reminders.,neutral
I found this app difficult to use. That's just my personal opinion. I uninstalled it and got a different one that is easier to use.,neutral
Helps me stay organized..,neutral
"I personally would like to add to this app, if I had a chance is change how the entires were set up. You had to make up the name. But it would make it better if it had a date and name. To me it feels like something you can do on a piece of paper. Add more cool features that you can't find anywhere else.",neutral
How to view the App on laptop? just like Wunderlist,neutral
"I have to uninstalled this app on my phone soon i open the apps and trying to make things to do list.. it worked fine just i have trypophobia and those small circles/dot just freaking me out... edit, the small circles/dots that i mean here is when i click new list next we fill the LIST NAME and it appears with small circles/dots in color for me who's having this kind of phobia that kind of design is just scary.. aside of that your apps seems to be simple and easy to use.",neutral
"Сильно не хватает возможности поделиться списком, например покупок, с семей",neutral
I couldn't find a way to link to Google Tasks. That is my first priority so I have data backup and desktop list edits.,neutral
No white space between tasks. No line between tasks. Checkboxes are in the middle of an item. One big block of text instead of neat list of tasks. Just impossible to see where each task starts.,neutral
"it's listing the same tasks after some time even after its checked and completed, in short it's listing the status of tasks",neutral
Great app but tried backing up and restoring for a new phone and got a version mismatch error with no option to convert it. No mention of this beforr backing up. Disappointing.,neutral
Nice app but doesn't really have what I'm looking for.,neutral
"sub tasks should be possible to leave unticked - for instance I might have put the bins out, but not replaced bin bags. on your apo, if I tick the main task, it assumes I have done the sub task.",neutral
awesome,neutral
"Its not easily understood and it does not notify if you are setting a task that the due date or due time is past. I might want to set 16:00hrm task tomorrow at 18:00hrm today, it will still set the task and will think I have set a task. Meanwhile the date is today",neutral
Not for me.,neutral
still testing,neutral
Still exploring the app but so far so good,neutral
Nice app but UX can be improved.,neutral
"Problem: When my Samsung Galaxy Note 10 does a system update, upon restart of the phone my Tasks with past due alarm settings (set for various times other that of the restart) start going off one after another. Strange! Still super helpful! Used at Easter for tasks to do days before (shop for turkey to thaw in time) & day of. Sublists worked great to set up each day separately under the same list. Suggestion: Allow sharing my list to WITHIN the app of another person who also has this app.",good
New to app but so far it is meeting my need,good
"As author said, check your battery settings to get notifications every time. Nice app to get notified when required",good
Great to be able to set reminders for tasks. Will recommend,good
Simple to use and useful app,good
"It's amazing but the premium is annoying but I guess it's fair due to the fact that the app is free even though you programmed it, I am very grateful",good
easy and does what it says. a bit of improvement can help but nonetheless a great app,good
"Excellent app in all ways...one thing that I could suggest is that we can add things in-between instead of the new items always going to the top or bottom...(other apps have this feature) ,but I would definitely recommend this...it even let's you color code what is important :) Thank you. :) Great app. :)",good
Great app. The subtasks feature really helps me feel I've achieved something when I can tick off a small part of a bigger job.,good
Great app!,good
Cool,good
"Beautiful app but not worth paying the subscription. Their web sync feature, only available for premium memebrs, is even worse than a free version of Todoist.",good
Easy to use and does the job in an easy user friendly format.,good
"Does almost everything i need. I have tasks that occur on the 2nd Sunday, 3rd Thursday, etc of each month. Can't figure out how to set the repeat for that.",good
"I just down loaded the app and figuring out out... So far so good. BUT.... 😊 When I open the app, I would like to see All my lists come up vs having to go to the top corner to pull them up. Did I miss a ""how to"" somewhere where this is possible? """,good
"I rarely rate apps, but this one is awesome. I use it all the time, for anything. If I may give feedback for improvement, I'd say it could use more useful widgets such as a calendar (Tasks' calendar is visible only when opening the app and as I note everything here I would appreciate a widget for me to see everything at a glance without opening the app) and I would like to be able to choose a List and it's sublist tabs to display as a widget rather than the sublist only. Keep up working! ~~",good
Nice app,good
Simple Way To Keep/Track Notes,good
Easy to use.,good
"I love this app and I plan to get premium, but I am waiting for list sharing. I will also update to 5 stars then! I just hope that you can share via copy/paste, as in it generates a list separated by commas and/or new lines so I can easily text it, that would be fantastic.",good
Good so far for basic list. Finding it hard to work out what else it can do.,good
"Great app, simple and elegant",good
"Application is beautiful, you can find the most common features of tasks , todo list include repeat task, notification , alarm , subtasks, real I like it after try more than 4 or 5 apps but I have some improvement wish to take in consideration. App design is not reach it can be more awesome or using material design , Second integration with online web view or Sync with google account to view/edit my tasks from browser (May be it's paid) if that at least open view for tasks for normal users, Thanks and keep the good progress :)",good
Very nice and clean. love the app,good
Quick and easy to use. Really helps me stay organized.,good
"It's a bit confusing for some people, can you make it easier for older people.",good
"So far, exactly what i needed and some. I havent used ut to its full potential but so far its more than enough!",good
"Works well, No behind hidden pay wall",good
App is good .. but it should offer features of grouping items day wise,good
Simple and effective (and I'm tech-challenged).,good
Love it but I just wish I could see all my lists at once in the widget,good
I like the app alot but there is one problem when i set the reminder as a alarm it doesn't ring on time and before this app was nice it's just that problem and now it doesn't ring on time and i missed a meeting because it rang late but anyway this app is nice.,good
The completed task button is hard to tap on phones with curved screen edges because it's too far too the outside. Moving it in a bit would make it perfect.,good
"amazing app! the fact that they provide so much flexibility on using subtasks is beyond my expectations. however,it lacks of personally the most important part of a task app; widget. dont get me wrong, i know there's the option for it, but everytime i try to put more than one, it kept showing the same task (i had a lot of tasks to put on my screen, so it was somewhat frustrating that i have to open the app to see the list). i hope they can add option to choose the task we want to display thx",good
I wish you could develop a voice reminder. Otherwise it's helpful.,good
Good program. Lacking a few options like multiple alerts.,good
"I love this ""notes"" app! The one thing missing is being able to attach picture files to a note. I would love if that could be added!",good
I like this app it so useful,good
Keeping me on top of stuff! Love the colors!,good
"Very good, a big step up from the Reminders app. Not perfect, some of the wording can bd confusing, but still a great app, and one that I think will be very useful. Plus, the widget is the best I've seen.",good
Very helpful once you get used to the menu's.,good
Good,good
"I like it, easy backup and simple clean interface.",good
Still finding new things i like! But i do wish i could add photos to some lists. A widget for one list would also be awesome!!!!!,good
"This app is fantastic!! It's simple, but extremely deep, allowing you to add quick tasks in an instant, but also categorize (and sub-categorize), customize, prioritize, and organize all your tasks in almost any way you want. You can set notifications, reminders, etc. I really love the filtered lists (eg. only high priority tasks due in 7 days or less), and subtasks are awesome! It would be nice to be able to have individual due dates for subtasks and the recurring tasks process is a wee clunky..",good
Good for shopping list,good
"This is a great app, really helps me get those to do's done.",good
It's a nice good looking app with one downside; you can create only 1 level of subtasks...,good
Enjoying using it. Still finding my way but all good so far,good
I like it up to now ☺,good
Useful. Only thing is need to put too many titles! 😁,good
"It's so easy to use, and so convenient to use.",good
"Has advanced features, and a simple interface.",good
"It's really easy to understand. I use it a lot. But somehow, I don't get a notification, for when a task is due.",good
It's great but I felt like it need a calender so you can see your to do list's you've made over the year so I suggest makeing a new version that has this on it so it will be much better if it had it I mean that's just my opinion on I but it's a great app if you just want to write your to do list and get it all over with and check of the biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg gggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg check lists you need to tick of.,good
Great app. But it doesn't remind me or send notifications,good
"This is one of my fave tool specially as a student, I like things being organized and neat so this app is a really great one!!! 💜",good
"Great app! Still waiting for a multi select option, but I know things take time. Its very similar to Wunderlist, which i loved. Hopefully it will make a great replacement.",good
Useful app for organizing. Possible to copy lists and move done tasks to other lists. Tasks can have subtasks.,good
It helps me remember.,good
"Very handy to keep track of my grocery lists, etc. Also, I can send lists to other apps, like messenger.",good
Love this app,good
Great for making my lists!,good
Nice and simple for my needs,good
Excellent app. This helps me be productive. Organise my daily task.,good
"Been brilliant for ages, now it crashes /freezes constantly. Looking for an alternative, sadly.",good
It is the best to do list app I ever used but there is some fault in the reminder . I added a task and set it to repeat daily but the reminder just reminds me on 1st day and then reminder stopped by itself.,good
Very helpful specially now that we need to keep a tight schedule for school and work,good
It's quite a useful app. I find it also easy to use.,good
"So far, very easy and intuitive to use!",good
Good app. Easy input and navigation.,good
Very good app,good
Preety good,good
Excellent resource for busy day,good
Very easy to use,good
Its exactly what I needed..... I am satisfied 😎 For 5 🌟 rating : It should have a feature with which I can analyse my throughout productivity.,good
"It's really a big pity that the app does not have badge icons.🙄 Otherwise it would be perfect, especially the custom recurring date option, which is a rarity. I give four stars though - as the app is really cool. Ps. Badge icons are the little red dots with numbers in them on the top right part of app icons/widgets showing missed calls, unread messages/mails, upcoming/due tasks etc.",good
"I really love this app, but it's not perfect. Here's my thoughts: Pros: - Allows you to make reminders either a push notification OR AN ALARM. This is VERY hard to find in a reminder app. - Highly flexible and customizable, allowing you to set priority, add sub-tasks, custom snooze lengths, etc. Cons: - Not a super clean interface. - Not always an intuitive interface. - The widget often gets behind. Overall, great for someone looking for a very flexible app, but not for a minimalist.",good
Very organised reminder,good
"Very helpful, enjoying it",good
I've been using this for a week now. I have found it to be a simple to use yet a valuable tool. Really recommend this app.,good
It's a great app. Giving it 4 star because I would like to see an option of dividing tasks into 2 sections based on completed or not. The app currently only has the option of marking as correct and striking through. Superb FREE app otherwise!!!,good
I only needed a way to make a to do list that I can check off. Tasks to do does this. It has many other features that I have not looked into or needed to use.,good
"The reminders are very helpful, the notification method works for me.",good
"So far, this app has been helpful and fairly easy to use.",good
Work exactly as promised!,good
"Love it, helps me keep my days on track!",good
"Looks good but no sound ,why?",good
Simple to use and pretty effective. Glad it has no ads and it is easy to make categories and sub catagories,good
"It has many features. Still getting used to it. So far, so good.",good
"Love this app, very helpful.",good
After a week of use it's almost perfect. A couple features aren't intuitive but I think I've figured it out. I love the widgets! Editing right from my home screen is SO great. 4/5 stars because there's no reoccurring task option and I can't figure out how to hide completed tasks. Thanks for a really fantastic & option rich app!! ❤️,good
Good,good
Useful and easy to use.,good
Nice and simple to use,good
"This app is perfect for my needs but there is one issue that I just noticed on repeated tasks. Once you hit complete the task, it will not add automaticly the next task. You have to check and then uncheck the task in order to show the next repeated task. Otherwise if you leave the task checked, it will not remind you for the next repeated task.",good
Easy to use,good
Simple app that meets my expectations,good
Its helpful,good
"Dev use case It would be nice if you could order your list by multiple options. Ex: Order first by date due, and then by priority.",good
"This app is very good. You can make a list of any activity which you do and keep yourself updated. Only concern i can see.. whenever we entered any task, open date should come.. and when we finish task finish date should come. Also if we want to delete any Task list, than app doesn't allow us for do that.",good
Easy to use,good
Great app. Helps in daily task setting and monitoring,good
Would be 5 stars if there were a setting to automatically return to home screen when creating a task via the widget,good
"So far so good,it works just fine!",good
"Simple, user friendly and very effective.",good
Been great!,good
It ticks what I need,good
"I love this app! I love the option for different colors for tasks. I originally got it because it was the only app that allowed me to do what I wanted to do for making grocery lists, but now I use it for every. The only feature I feel is missing right now is the option to add files to a task. Or subtask.",good
"Simple, reliable and syncing with Google calendar. Love it so much.",good
"It is very useful in Grocery shopping! And for a daily routine! I recommend you getting it, especially if you are a busy person!",good
"Good organizational app. Could use more tutorial guidance, but most things can be figured out. Would recommend.",good
"Works good, I wish I could voice command to add a note",good
The app is super easy to use and the due date function is a great help to not procrastinate,good
Really useful app! It does the job well. I like the customisation of colours and stuff. I wish there was a homepage where you can see all your lists like a bulletin board and more aesthetic customisation would be nice. Without making it too cluttered ofc. Just my 2 cents opinion.,good
Best one I 've used to date,good
Nice,good
"With ADHD, ive been having a hard time organizing my time, and this helps considerably. Thank you!",good
"Great app for writing down things you need to do and stay organized. Love how I can put the widget on the home screen and use it from there. Also like how I can color code each list and shows when they were created and completed. Good thinking. Dont think I can back up my info/tasks to save for later, but it's a pretty great useful app.",good
"This app is so useful for me during lockdown, covid19. As iam able to complete my school work and also other impt task ,so thanks a lot but, I suggest you to please make sure that time which is given us , is for both start-stop the work so that one can know his or her time allocation for the work , although this app is literally so nice 👍😊",good
"After you figure out how to best organize yourself, it's extremely satisfying to check off items from your lists. The only thing I do not like us that you can't simply delete lists.",good
Nice user experience. Would be helpful if able to sync with Gmail account,good
Great 👌 easy to use on n Samsung Galaxy note.,good
Pretty good app! Will recommend over others.,good
It's a good application to keep you on track,good
"Thanks for your quick correspondence. I understand how the application's progress is limited due to resources, and hope that this will improve for all involved with time. I know times are tough for many worldwide, which means funding, now more than before, is harder to come by. All the best. Cheers.",good
"So far so good, app is really fun to use and easy to add tasks on the fly",good
"Great app but there is still for improvment until reaches the standards of the beloved Wunderlist. Edit as answer: there is nothing wrong with the app, but once one could use Wunderlist, well, that is a 5 stars. Hard to reach it. The most important thing is well out of reach for a personal project: the web interface and the multiplatform concept. Certainly other details, but as you know Wunderlist is deceased so I can't go back and make a side by side comparison. Note that I don't do the silly thing of rate what I don't like with 1 and what I like with 5. Between 1 and 5 there is the 2,3 and 4 and they should be used. A four is a very good rate. A 5 is for something which is truly unbeatable, unique, the best.",good
Good way for organizing tasks,good
Very easy to use once you understand the difference between the list name and the actual task name. You place various tasks into whatever lists you create.,good
Good for a shopping list,good
If you like a simple app to get the job done...this is it.,good
Super,good
I could not find a save button. I had problem adding a task then adding a sub task. One this was sorted I have managed to have tasks and sub tasks. Would like to be able to sort list alphabetically.,good
Good,good
"I could use this application to categorize my short and long terms goals. I appreciate that, Thanks.",good
"everything is good but sometimes i dont get notifications, the other lists do but one doesn't",good
Great app. Easy to use and very useful. My only wish is that it interacted with Google assistant so that I could add tasks with voice. I drive alot and I tend to think of things to add.,good
"Works well. My big complaint is that for repeated items, the date does not update after you mark it completed. I have tasks that are meant to be done every 3 days that still say due May 14th Even after marking them complete. Fix this and I will give 5 stars. LG V40 thinQ",good
Keeps me on track.,good
Really helpful app. But it would be great if you guys add lock feature for individual entry. And make the backup feature in such a way so that if i uninstall and then install it again i require a pin to unlock the locked entry. Also if possible add the pin on notification option.,good
"Of all the check list apps I've tried out, this one is the best organized, and it's customizable without being overly complicated.",good
"When I buy a product on the list and touch the item that I bought, I simply wish to see a line through it, and it is that deleted item along with all other deleted items that I wish to keep forever so that when time comes again, I can touch the deleted item and simply remove the line strikethrough as an item to purchase again, so it is the deleted items I wish to keep forever.",good
I wish i can use hand writing,good
"Nice organizational app with lots of lists. I do wish it would save a task when you add it to a list rather than when you hit the button to save the whole list, I've lost some lists I wrote because I pressed back instead of save by accident. In general love the app though.",good
Helpful and easy to use. Really good app for students or people who struggle with remembering tasks they have to get done.,good
Big help as I always have mobile phone with me,good
I like that I can make different lists and sublists of tasks and it's easy to move something from one list to another or cross something off. The one thing it's missing is that if I have a list called Today and one called Tomorrow it doesn't automatically change where the tasks are. Like if I have a task on Today and don't get to do it I'd love for it to show up in my Tomorrow list tomorrow. Otherwise it's easy to use and I also love that there is a place to put notes for each task item.,good
It does what it says rather nicely. Advanced reminders are nice. Easy to use.,good
Very helpful in organizing my life,good
Very helpful when it comes to organizing,good
"Really helps to know when tasks are completed. It would be a solid 5 if, when you shared say with google drive, that the Completed DATES would transcribe in the transfer. Major reason for chosing this app was knowing when something was accomplished. Otherwise a great piece of software. Very functional in task management.",good
"This has everything I'm looking for from a UI perspective except one key thing: the ability to invite someone else to add/complete list items with you. It's the function Wunderlist fulfilled for us and I've been looking for a replacement ever since they were bought by MS. Add it, and it will be the dream list app I want!",good
This is a really cool app to plan your day through out...super colourful..but I found something bad....that is the remainders are not working properly.. please work on it.. otherwise it it super cool... EDIT : Thanks for your reply sir....I have tried all the ways to make it work but still it is not working..,good
"Very easy to use, good",good
"Amazing app, only wish that when you search it would also look in sub task. Also would like Tags for both task and sub taks",good
So far so good! Great app!,good
Amazing app,good
Easy to handle.,good
i think its over all a good app!,good
So far so good I like the simple clean layout and I purchased the premium so loving being able to jot down on either device would love a grocery list but I'll figure it out as I go,good
It helps me complete the task I wanted to do. It also reminds me on what to do if I ever forgot something. 👍👌,good
good app . if you could add priority input at quick add level it would be wonderful or else . if multitask could be added priority ar 1 go would be good,good
Easy to use. Perfect need to make a to do list,good
Simple and very helpful,good
"Best Todo list I've tried so far,think I'll keep this one",good
"Using it for the past week. So far, it's great.",good
Works perfectly. Helping heaps to manage my day.,good
"This application is worth INSTALLING. It REALLY helps you to remain ORGANISED without any stress. Humble Suggestion: It would have been more convenient, if you had provided 2-3 reminders possible WITHOUT MANDATORY SNOOZE. To understand this concept very clearly, you are REQUESTED to study SnPlan application. All the best.",good
Really excellent for keeping track of daily routines or one time events far off. I would appreciate some options on when daily tasks reset and that the task would reset the next day if I missed it but these are small complaints. This has really improved my quality of life.,good
"I love this app so much. This is the app that I search for a long time. BUT, the widget sometimes error. It show the tasks that already checked being unchecked. When I clicked it, the app just show white screen or freezing. After several minutes, it became normal again. Even though it will be normal again, of course that's so annoying! When I'm in rush to create task, the freeze often makes me forget about the things that I want to write. Please, fix this! Thank you.",good
"So far I love the app. It allows you to have multiple lists. I like the different colour options for each list. The sub task section is useful, especially since you can see it under the main task.",good
"Good, so far",good
I kinda love this app but the only problem that I've face now is that i want to have my task on my pc and i think it would be great if you could put some accounts so that we can easily sort our task in any devices that we are into,good
Hi Steve. Is it possible to add voice reminder notifications in your app using google TTS tool?,good
I love it but theres one thing you should add. A note pad for notes for extra.,good
Helps me remember things that I need to do.,good
How can I change the language??,good
This app is so far the best todo list app. It has almost everything I want but currently if I complete a subtask it doesn't add up to the main percentage of menu list (only shows percentage in absolute value) unless I complete all the subtask under a task. I really need it to show the percentages like this (i.e: 90.5%) if I am unable to complete some of the sub tasks,good
Practical,good
"I really love the app, the design and functionality. It's just that, I hope there is a way to better navigate the different tasks. They are together on the left menu with the calendar. Calendar is not even a task.",good
"Not bad, pretty basic but its helpful",good
It sucks and it awesome,good
"Helps stay organized, wish it kept track daily",good
Nice,good
Helpful with reminding me of things that need to be done,good
"I've been using your app for awhile now & love it, but for the 1st time today everything I did since last night is not there & I do a lot of personal & work things. Can you please help me with this problem?",good
yeah!🤩,good
Great and fabulous. Helps me to manage and organise my tasks,good
So far working great...,good
Clean layout and does what it says without egregious permissions. Two thumbs. Unfortunately I can't find information about the app's functions even within the help menu: - Recurring tasks do not appear to reset if they are not complete. I can't figure out how to make them reset even if they are incomplete. - I can't make my recurring items show up on the calendar. - I can't manually set the reset time since my tasks might be completed between 8pm and 3 am. - View previous recurring tasks.,good
Really good app.,good
Very handy tool.,good
Useful one,good
Just started using. Can't figure out yet how to delete completed tasks instead of moving or crossing them off.,good
"Update: developer responded quickly with explanation. So impressed that I'm trying it anyway. ___ Original review: Couldn't move onto SD card, so didn't have the space to keep it and try it properly.",good
Having a list of things to buy with items linked to tasks would be great,good
😎💯,good
It's a very good app but only needs some changes.......,good
Great reminder for me! Love it,good
This is really great app,good
Helps to keep on track. Thanks,good
Love this app! Not only helps me organize my tasks but also makes me feel great at the end of the day seeing how much I accomplished!,good
Best of its kind. Just what I was looking for.,good
Muy útil. Me encanta,good
So helpful!,good
I think the notification problem is already solved :),good
It is great if u want to keep thngs organized,good
"Best customer experience! I have been using this app for a long time. Really versitile and pleasing to the eye. Recently switched phone and was having some trouble getting everything to work. Contacted customer service for help. Super supportive, replied quickly, and problem successfully solved! Would recommend nothing else!",good

Very handy. Well designed. Good app.,good
Excellent,good
Great app!!,good
"Its a nice app. But i wish when i add it to my homescreen it shows all my notes. It make me chose one the tasks and i cant see the others. Edit: thank you steve for the fast reply! I didnt like the filter bec. I also want to see them seperate not all together. But using a second widget helped. Here, 5 stars 😊",good
"10.25.20 Still amazing app! Hoping for option to display calendar view on widget! 10.6.20 Have to gush about how amazing this app is again! From the colors (I'm a designer and fine artist so colors help me organize) to on point organizational capabilities and lack of ads + beautifully functional customizable design, this app is literally the glue holding my life together! So grateful for the creator and the app ♥ 9.17.20 Perfect,love the color options,organization,and every thoughtful feature",good
"Great app. However backups were disabled for non premium users, which made me sad. Happy to support the dev with premium and 5 stars tho.",good
Love it,good
Great app!,good
So easy and effective. Even a little fun!,good

Simple and nice interface. Didn't expect much didn't get dissappointed.. Try it yourself,good
"Great so for keeping to do list, grocery list, etc. Easy to create, update, sort, copy, & share.",good
Easy to use and very helpful,good
Pretty Satisfied I have only used it to capture things I think of that I need to do. I can assign a priority but I haven't explored all the options for incorporating it in to my calendar or anything else. I think I will get more use from it once I take a little time with it. I don't plan on paying for the full version so read the fine print.,good
"Love this app, very easy and intuitive.",good
"I use it mostly for grocery shopping. I know the layout of the store, so I drag the items into the order I'll see them in the store.",good
"Great app, great support also!",good
This is the best app that replaced my planner!! I literally recommend this to all my friends and family.,good
"Works well, handy tool",good
"It is the best app,I've ever seen.It really has changed my life.I just hope that it could have a default list.",good
My experience gas been good so far 👌👌.,good
Easy navigation..simple ..clean with alarm ..etc...After trying 10..I found this one the best..perfect10,good
THE BESTTTTTTTT,good
"So far, I'm loving it. Edit: I've been using it for more than a month now and it been very helpful in organizing the many tasks that I must do for my business.",good
Great App like it so far,good
Love the way this app is organized,good
It has all I need to plan my tasks,good
This app is great! Now I could know what would I do. It's really good for school as well.,good
When I was offered a management position I had to get organised this app did just that!!,good
Awesome,good
"Useful in orgnanizing lists and tasks, along with sub-lists and notes. Easy to use, and can set reminders and due dates.",good
"It's nice, simple, and helps me to make lists that I can check off.",good
Easy to keep track,good
"This app is great! I have ADHD and also have had a lot of trouble finding an app that works, but I really love this one. :)",good
"Excellent, easy to use application to help keep you focused on what needs to be done.",good
"The ultimate task, list, and reminder organizer app! Tasks does a wonderful job at taking the work out of managing tasks, projects, and lists. It supports multiple lists, sub-lists, priorities, due dates. Notes can be added to each item and drag & drop makes it easy to manually sort. Premium version is well worth the productivity gains and time savings I get - all for the price of about 3 cups of coffee! ☕☕☕😀 Highly-recommended. Very good and responsive developer support as well. 👍👍🏻",good
easy to add tasks and set reminders. love it!,good
EXACTLY what I wanted! I'll never make a list on paper again!!!,good
its a great app without ad. most things are fully customizable,good
"I love being able to move tasks, tick them off and have them move to other lists or the bottom of the list. I can do sub lists and break things down into steps. Helps me to feel motivated and keep track. I struggle with getting distracted so it's a very helpful app.",good
Great,good
Exceeded my expectations & helps me a lot with things I need to do & morning routines.,good
"This is by far the best task managing app I've ever used to date, and its suprisingly versatile.",good
Love the colors and multiple lists. Easy to use n looks great!,good
"Simple to use/understand, dependable, flexible, and therefore the best designed USEABLE task lister I've ever found. Great job, devs!",good
Best task list ever every other task list was terrible the others didn't have a alarm So download this game,good
Good,good
The best,good
This thing really works. I've been getting so much more done.,good
Easy and helpful,good
I love it. It does exactly what I need it to do.,good
It's useful. I m just learning to use it,good
It really helps me stay organized. I used to write my list on paper and would sometimes lose it. This is great all in one place.,good
Super impressed with this app and its simple task note widget,good
"Brilliant app! Very sensibly designed, intuitive to use, does everything I need. The best organiser app I've come across (and I've tried quite a number). Thanks for the great work, Stephen!",good
I switched from another time tracking app to this one. I like the way you can see all the time on one page and easily edit that information. Reporting is easy also. Switching work type on-the-go is very convenient. It has many configurable units as well. I recommend this to anyone needing to track their work time.,good
Very useful. Well designed.,good
Long time I'm using . Very good app,good
"Good app ! Lists, sublists and reminders available along with additional comments for each of it.",good
Easy to use,good
Great! Very helpful. Love that I can create recurring tasks!,good
"Does what it does, stays out of the way otherwise. Good control over notifications, and easy to use.",good
"Been using this app for years, and its only gotten better with every new update! This is my most important app! I use the tasks app to do everything from actually making lists for like shopping and stuff, to recording dreams and making plans!",good
Great app for forgetful minds,good
"Great app, exactly what i needed.",good
I love this app. Keeps everything organized and is so easy to use,good
This app is easy to use and it helps me a lot!,good
Wonderful. Finally an app that works. Have tried hundreds of task list type apps. This one is designed perfectly. Thanks. Will probably buy pro version,good
I can organize my shopping into different departments and swipe from one department to another without having to exit one list and open another. Makes shopping much easier!,good
Nice app,good
Finished / checked tasks reappear after a time as unfinnished,good
I really appreciate the creator responding immediately so I'll definitely give this app a 5 star. It's pretty convenient to use and supposedly the issue that I have is not being able to add more than one of its widget but I guess that's already in my phone's model feature not the app itself.,good
Superb!!!!,good
I love that the widget is right there on home screen.,good
ای لاو ایت,good
Good app,good
"It's great to get reminders to complete tasks. Also, it's useful to be able to add items to my grocery list when I am out and about. Plus, once an item is added, I can mark it as picked up without deleting it from my list for next time.",good
Good,good
Simply Awesome,good
I like the way it looks,good
"It's really a good app because I can set-up alarms for different uses. (Sadly for many times the alarm set didn't alarm on time. I hope in the future they could fix this. This is really important because I need many reminders every week that I shouldn't miss or else other people could be affected.) I tried before setting an alarm in my phone's alarm app but doesn't look good. This one really works for me, a big help. Thanks. 😁",good
I like it. I know all the drawing I started and need to finish :),good
Ideal app to keep me organized,good
best to do list 💕✨,good
"So far I love it. Clear and simple to navigaye. Able to make my lists in cour coding. Also nice design, fir the creative.",good
Very helpful for me to memorize scripture and keep up with daily as well as weekly work tasks,good
This is the perfect app! It feels like it's custom made for me!,good
The best 👌,good
Great apo,good
User friendly and compatible with other apps in use. I enjoy this app very much.,good
"Advanced and has all the functions caked into one, eliminating the need for other task management apps",good
Great muti-organiser with multiple lists,good
Great app! Have been using it for a while and it really helped me to get my life together.,good
Very nice and helpful app,good
Great app! Very versatile and customizable.,good
"Keeps me organised throughout the day, something that is so important as I tend to get distracted by things that are more appealing. Thank you so much for this great app that keeps me on track 🙂",good
Easy to use,good
"Very helpful, simple to use app that helps remind me what I need to do and what my priorities are for the day or the week. It's helped me stay on track and supported creating new habits. Highly recommend!",good
love it,good
"Found it, used it, I love it",good
"It's perfect,I love it.😍😍😍",good
Cool,good
This is the app to get! Insanely helpful getting me to keep track of all the things I need to get done daily for my home business homeschooling stay at home mom chores and personal tasks ect. Love the colors love to cross off tasks and i love time stamp on completed tasks. Can't think of anything that would improve the app. Perfect. Love it.,good
Very easy to use,good
It's just perfect,good
Keeps me stay organized,good
Nice and easy to keep track of day to day tasks as well as longterm and continuous tasks.,good
"Best task app ever, strongly recomended",good
Use it daily. So far so good,good
"this is my favorite to do list app, it just 😌👌it has sublists and everything. i've been using it for a bit with only one downside. adding tasks from a widget opens the app, which kinda defeats the point of the widget. great app 👌👌",good
"Haven't had it long. Seems to do the trick, I travel often and need a way to organize packing lists for varied destinations and I like having a way to keep up with shopping needs, things I'm expecting in the mail, and things I want to remember to bring next time.",good
Simple and effective,good
"Great, simple, pretty (love the colors), intuitive app. Love it! The developer is super responsive and helpful. This has quickly become my favorite of all the productivity apps I have used over the years. Thank you!",good
This app is awesome. I love that you can have lists and sublists. And how you can set alarms.,good
"Wonderful apps remind me of those important dates, such as credit card statements, utility bills that you don't want to miss.... simple to use, you can set up a reminder in less than 30 seconds. Highly recommended.",good
"The app is pretty good, even without premium. It lets you organize and customize your tasks, give lists different colours and even has a dark mode.",good
"Perfect, everything I wanted, exactly how I wanted it",good
It is great app to keep me organized.,good
"Really enjoy this application. Definetly keeps me organized and super easy to add, subtitle and correct. I grade it a 10.",good
Very helpful,good
"It is easy to use, i like it! If i got a job someday i'll definietly upgrade to premium.",good
Have been using this app for about a month now to list jobs and to do around the house. Easy to list all things needing done to remind you of what's still needed and what is finished.,good
Very useful and very easy to use,good
Easy to use. Love the colors. Helps me stay organized.,good
Handy app,good
This is the best one of these apps. Ignore the other ones just get this.,good
You will gonna Love this app i swear,good
"best, but smtimes missing my notification, please make more reminder option, and more hard to rid it)",good
"Just started using the app and I am impressed so far. One thing I haven't figured out how to do yet, is setting a repeating task based on the day of the month, i.e., the first Wednesday of the month or the last Friday of the month, etc. (Updated rating and review) I just updated my rating from 4 stars to 5, because of the responsiveness of the developer.",good
Really enjoying this app. Love the sub-list feature and the ability to move task to another list.,good
"this app helped me organize myself, thank you!",good
Easy to add and remove tasks. I need simple or I wont do it. Lazy? Maybe but I'm being real.,good
Easy to use and intuitive!,good
"Hvn't bn using very long but so far it's been a great app. Only issue I have is when working on a list, if I pause to check something then go back to Tasks screen it defaults back to another list instead of the one I've been working on; so hv to be careful something doesn't accidently wind up on the wrong list. UPDATE: Developer took the time to reply same day with a logical & reasonable explanation.",good
Useful app to organise tasks,good
I love this app. This is very helpful for me especially for my studies. It notifies me and it easier for me to take down or type down my assignments or requirements that needs to be accomplish.,good
"Great app, easy to use 👍",good
"This is actually a really beautiful, well made app. Blessed to have found it, thank you.",good
"Works well, easy to manage love the ""subtask""",good
I really liked the sublist,good
I really love this app. Very clean cut and simple. Very helpful.,good
Great app!,good
So far ..great. keeps me from forgetting things I need to do,good
"Love the widget. Love how you can easily reorder tasks. Love how you can check and uncheck things. I use this for meal planning, time blocking, and cleaning tasks.",good
Nice work,good
love this app so much <3 it's helped me out a ton!,good
"I really like many of the function, especially since they are easy to use. Now if I may say, I would like to see a more elaborate calendar set up much like the one used in Google Calendar where the user can see the whole month at once. Plus, it can be very useful to add an option where tasks are set up where they repeat even if the user has missed a deadline for a previous one. I'm a college student and I like to see what sorts of homework I have done and which ones I have missed.",good
"Has been very useful this past year, no longer need to think or stress about a long list of tasks.",good
Nice listing options,good
"I actually never ever write comments or anything about an app, but this one is too good. I have so many assignments that are due and lots of work and its overwhelming. I was searching everywhere for a decent app, and this one was the best. You can set alarms or notifications for assignments, you can title each subject, color code everything, qnd its just a great app. No citiques from meh",good
Keeps me organized with my assignments,good
"The reminders on my phone quit working, I found this and used it as a replacement. Best reminders app ever. It helps me stay really organized I I reccomend it",good
"UPDATED: After getting feedback from the developer I now see that you can set up repeat tasks, you just have to set a due date before the option appears. I use this app almost daily and I love the ability to have sub task lists. Now that I know how to set repeat tasks I anticipate using it even more. Thank you Stephen for reaching out to me and helping me with your app. Got your fifth star up there now. 😄",good
It is easy to use,good
Beautiful app. So thankful that it's free. Helps me so much with managing both school and life tasks.,good
Excellent app for to do lists and reminders either by alarm or notification. Would love if it also added a banner to the locked phone screen,good
"Tried several other to do lists but liked this one better. Helps me to make myself reminders, just have to remember to make the lists. It's hard getting old.",good
"So glad I found this app. I used Google Keep for years, but decided to look for a new app to replace Keep bc lists max out at 1000 to-do items, colors are limited and other probs. I'm very happy with Tasks! It has way more options than Keep. Tasks handles subtasks better, lets you move items from one list to another, set recurring tasks and check them off each day, add task level due dates, records when task were added to list. Beautiful interface and great functionality!",good
"Everything works exactly as it should, it is user friendly and perfect. No nonsense and I would totally pay for this if I had to.",good
Awesome application to manage your tasks. You've all required features. Simple yet effective interface Thanks for many such nice and making everyone's life easier,good
"Very useful, really like the organization of this app, tried others but this works really well.",good
I love it.,good
Excellent,good
Easy Peasy...better than little notes that get lost. Love this App!,good
"I LOVE the fact that this app allows me to create subtasks. It's been extremely helpful for me! I was behind in all of my college classes (bit off more than I can chew) but this app really helped me take on the workload step-by-step. Now, two weeks later, I'm back on top of things! This app was a huge help!",good
I can got all I need in this app. Good job.,good
"Easy to use and having most functions that I desire. Just one thing I would suggest: for the recurring tasks, it would be more useful if I mark completed this time but the app will remark it as an open task when it reaches half of the interval before next due date. Hope the smart developer can make it works like this way soon. Good luck! ☺",good
Easy like a checklist that is ticked off. All I need.,good
Very useful and easy to use,good
Great,good
"Extremely easy. Works fast. Can organize alphabetically and many other ways. I used another app just before this one, and uninstalled it immediately to use this one instead. Thank you.",good
"Absolutely love this app! It's the best To Do list app I've found, and I've tried a lot. It's just so simple and intuitive. I won't be trying any more after this. It's the one!",good
"I am 76 years old: So. when I say this is a flexible, expansive, yet intuitive app you can believe me.",good
"Fantastic app. I was using Samsung notes before I discovered this app. Very well laid out, easy to use, and with so many good features and options. Kudos to the developer. I don't usually provide feedback on an app due to privacy, but with this one I had to let the developer and the public know. Best in class. Thanks a million.",good
The best app for taskas and very helpful go stay on tracks. Simple and intutive. 5 stars from Serbia.,good
Easy to use and helps me stay on top of tasks,good
Nice app,good
"Really easy to use, helps keep all my lists in one place. One request please: is it possible to choose to 'hide' future-dated tasks until a week before they're due, or at a specified date?",good
I used to use this app for years but it does not sync on OnePlus 7t android 10 I have to sync on Google calendar first to update events on this app!!!,poor
Somehow just cleared my entire schedule,poor
Xperia 5 II: Newly created tasks in device don't sync to Google tasks. Had the same problem with Xperia z3 compact. It worked on on S10e.,poor
Any event with repeat will not save. New update as of Sept 2020 cannot set recurring events. And I paid years ago for full version. No longer useful.,poor
I loved using this calender app to keep track of all my appointments until it suddenly deleted them all in the middle of my work day 😣 now I'm screwed,poor
"2 bad , not as expected, no sound alarm :(",poor
Broke widget on Fold 2. Widget is stretched and distorted.,poor
"I had this app for less than 5 minutes on my Samsung Note 9. I also keep widgets that count down the days...all of them are empty, so I go to my old calendar after Uninstaller this one and most of my calendar events are gone!!@ This includes my work schedule and many other events...I am at my wits end about what to do to get my events back..sooo not happy right now",poor
They took the ads too far and ruined the entire experience. Completely useless as a free app.,poor
"I uninstalled it within 20 minutes of paying for the Pro version. It was refunded. Its Pro features don't work as hoped, especially font and color customization: the unpaid version advertised *presets,* aka themes. But they did not exist in the *Pro* version. This is on an Android 10, Oxygen 10.3.1 TMUS 1+6T. Developer, your 2020.10.14 reply makes no sense: it still doesn't take into account this *particular* phone or my specific terms. I'm letting you know there's a bug. And your reply of 2020-10-19 just means you deliberately confuse the matter with nonsensical questions. This has been going on for months. It's why we're not using this app, free or paid, on *any* of our phones.",poor
"Thieves! I paid for the pro version on another Google account, but I had to delete that account because of a massive influx of spam and harassment. Every other developer understood my situation and was kind enough to provide me with a promotion code so that I could have full access to the software of theirs I paid for. Not these jerks! I spread the blame equally on Google for failing to provide a way to transfer purchases, and on these developers for being predatory capitalist pigs.",poor
"This app needs access to everything so of course like a dipshitidiot I gave access. Next time I went to sign into something else my passwords were flagged and a warning pops up stating that ""an app or website has compromised your passwords"". I stupidly bought this app because you cannot customize without buying, I should have deleted right then, but I still paid. Now my passwords have been compromised by this app, I'm spending extra time changing passwords to protect my data all because of the",poor
"Ads, trial, limited and boring. I understand of ads appearing after every now and then. But what I wanted to use was the 1 day widget on the screen. Could not even do that.there are tons of ad free apps that let you do all these. Uninstalling.",poor
"Now down to 1 star for the unappreciated bilingual holiday settings for BC Canada. Absolutely no need for this. The phone and app setting where the language is set to ""English"" should override any other situation. I didn't get a satisfactory answer from the dev. I'll keep deducting stars as long as the app doesn't improve. Update July '20: over 543 different apps and the only 1 ramming French down my phone is BC2! My 1 star won't change until you do. No change!!!",poor
"I had the app for long time but lately have started has the longest and most annoying advs that you can't even close your phone without watching them all. Plenty of other apps so no reason to keep it, unistall immediately.",poor
"Unfortunately I have to change my mind about this calender. I use this app for several years now and the prior version before, but now every now and then the app overerrides all future calender entries in my main calender. I believe it happens when the app gets an update. After the update the app syncs with the calender and overrides the Google calender so that all future entries are deleted.... This is not acceptable. Has this issue been known to be occurring? As for now this app does not work!",poor
Contains too many trackers while being paid. Use aCalendar+ or even better Etar instead.,poor
Keeps removing monthly scheduled events,poor
"Calendar notifications are forwarded to my smartwatch, in case of emergency. It is unacceptable to have commercials in those notifications, such as today's ""Pro: 50% off! Unlock tons of premium features now!"" Such notification spam makes me want to switch to a different calendar app. Quit it!",poor
"Now there are ads. I have used this app for years and there were no annoying ads. Now i randomly get a full screen ad with no way to dismiss, after saving a new calendar entry. Bad move. A small ad at the bottom of the screen would be ok, but a full screen ad that has to play all the way through? No thanks. Will find a new app. Very disappointed.",poor
Junk app.,poor
"Been great for years. The ads are really annoying. They are long video ones that pop up every single time you add an event. Laughably the response is 'it's only every 18 hours'. Guess how often casual calendar users use the app? I wouldn't mind if it was a short add or i had to watch a video to unlock more actions, but the current cx is super annoying.",poor
"Ads are obnoxious. I've used this app for over 2 years and now whenever I edit a calendar event, an ad comes up and takes up my entire screen. Unfortunately I'll be looking for a new app.",poor
I am upset I switch phones and don't know what happen I dont have anything I wrote in calender there anymore... and it was buisness stuff!!!,poor
"Don't pay for pro! I paid for the pro, changed phones and it removed my pro status and wants me to pay again!",poor
"Used to be good, but recently it shows full screen ads which cannot be turned off. Update: the length of the adds and impossibility to skip is getting annoying. The synchronization is not wat it was.",poor
Too many ads are a deal breaker. Uninstalling.... UNSKIPPABLE ADS ARE A DEAL BREAKER!,poor
"This app use to be ""all calendars in one app"" but not anymore. So frustrating that you are not able to add anymore O365/Exchange calendars. Not willing to use 2 separate calendar apps. Sorry.",poor
"Uninstalling. Ad after ad after ad after ad. On and on and on and on. Sick of it, tired of it. Can't even have a simple calender app without all the ads. Done with it.",poor
Ads are very intrusive,poor
Ads take over the screen - unable to use phone until the ad runs through. Can't even exit the app during that period of time. Have to provide another ads option such as banner ads.,poor
After using this app for a few years it has suddenly started deleting random appointments (It's done this before). The app cost me over £200 in lost earnings due to missed appointments last week so it's getting deleted and I'm going back to the stock app until I find a better one.,poor
I've used this app for years and paid for the full pro version out right. Now it claims I haven't bought it and keeps putting ads in. One star until I can get this fixed.,poor
Unskippable fullscreen ads in a calendar app that I paid for. Nice. At least this reminded me how much better the default calendar app is anyways.,poor
"Widget does not display Holidays or Birthday's? Not even the app it self shows Holidays. I uninstalled and reinstalled several and nothing. I have it sync with my Samsung calendar and the option to show holidays too. I have the paid version without adds. Oddly enough I only can see 2 holiday's in 2021 which are first day of black history month and first day of women's history month? No Christmas, New Years, Memorial Day or any other.",poor
Having to link my existing calander with the separate calander defeats the purpose of having a separate work calander....I'm not trying to have a screen filled with sht I have to spend a ton of time scanning through and dividing between. I'll buy a paper agenda... thanks for the effort though 👃,poor
"Many seconds of full screen commercials when saving new events. Earlier versions were much better, now I need to use another calendar as this is too annoying.",poor
"Ads that completely take over your phone & have a forced timer so you can't exit out of them. - EDIT - It's untrue what the developer says regarding ads appearing once every 18 hours, it is more frequent. The ""skip"" the developer is referring to is NOT instantly available, you must wait a timer out. - It wouldn't be a problem if the ads weren't so disruptive, they literally take over your screen. I have no problem with small less annoying ads.",poor
"Why in the world there's no sign-in or backup option? How am I supposed to store my data? This app is so great but not having the very important feature makes no sense, I'm so disappointed!",poor
I like the options but doesn't sync with my calendars. I bought a app called One Calendar & that one dies sync well with my calendars. If you could fix the sync issue this app would be the best.,poor
Latest version is buggy it does not Sync at all,poor
La pubblicità è diventata insopportabile,poor
Today the pro version said it's not pro any longer and asked for payment. On another device it's still pro.,poor
Get this calendar app if you like to watch daily full-screen video ads. There are calendar apps without ads. Get one of them instead :),poor
What the hell? Most recent update introduced FULL SCREEN ADS you cannot immediately dismissed! Happens whenever you add to your calendar. Developer has officially jumped the shark. Finding an alternate!,poor
Ads,poor
Garbage... Does allow adding exchange calendars,poor
"I have been waiting for a promised refund since 25th June, have sent several emails. Would appreciate my refund",poor
I purchased this app once but for sone reason i now have the free version??? Whats up with that???,poor
Used to be great but just constantly wipes out all my repeat appointments now! It's become absolutely useless and support never respond. I pay for proband it's now money down the drain,poor
"Can't add an Outlook calendar that isn't on MS Exchange, so that means you can't add any regular personal Outlook calendar. That's pretty bad. EDIT: The developer response links to a page discussing MS Exchange-enabled Outlook accounts. My comment was regarding non-Exchange accounts. So the developer didn't even read my review properly.",poor
"I want dedicated column for week number in month view widget!!! Added after editors reply: I want week numbers in separate column, NOT IN SUNDAY COLUMN!!! And I do not understand why I have to get votes on forum to get updated feature, even if I paid for it.",poor
"I was using it and thought it was pretty good.I had my whole business schedule on it, then I lost my phone. I got a new phone and downloaded the app again, logged on and no schedule! It was gone! I lost thousands of dollars and had many clients pissed off at me... So disappointed...",poor
I can't add my Gmail account to your calendar. Used to work flawlessly earlier. Now just won't let me add my account and won't automatically sync data from account,poor
Garbage. Fails to notify reminders about half the time unless app tab is open. Phone and app settings verified. Missed a long awaited appointment this morning...why even bother setting reminders,poor
With the addition of publicity deep the app lost its productivity side.,poor
"Since full screen ads were introduced, this calendar app has become very frustrating to use. Despite having found the app to be one of the best calendar apps available, the ads are now too much of a hindrance.",poor
"Too much ads in the free version. Impossible to stop to watch it until the end, i'm not the first to strongly condamn it, you reply you are trying to fix it, but you set it !!! Should be less aggressive, and may be more users customers. I waited few months you react and correct it. ==> personaly i'm unstalling it",poor
Was a good app but recently started flooding you with long ads that you can't get out of until they are finished playing. So annoying. Checking out other calendars now.,poor
"Ads that cover the whole screen [Later update] Since you bothered to respond to my review I will elaborate: 1. Any app that displays weird looking adds (ads for games?!) that cover the whole screen are suspicious apps: spyware, etc. You should count yourself lucky that I did not report your app to Google. The only reason for not doing that is that I've been using your app for some time, before the new ad behavior, and it was fine. 2. Let's ignore my previous point for a minute and consider this: a ""Business Calendar"" app that sends me adds about online games that I can ""skip"" by stopping the app and then re-opening... Really, if I'm a business person what would I want with an online game for children? 3. You mentioned the apps has to be deployed daily. Tough luck! I did not make your release schedule, you did. Furthermore I would be perfectly fine using an older version of the app, with no ads, or far fewer adds. I really don't care about the latest releases, and most business people don't either. We want stable things that we don't need to upgrade every week or so. 4. Since the ads covering the whole screen started being pushed I realized that your app has little added value over the calendar apps that came preinstalled on my mobile devices... And they don't have any adds.",poor
Does not sync. Not worth it to miss meetings. Force synced does not typically refresh. Back to Google Calendar. Sync is a big part of being a calendar app.,poor
"I'm so disappointed. I've used this app for years as it was one of the best calendar apps, but now the obtrusive video ads that hold you hostage have completely changed the experience. I finally had to uninstall it because it's to the point where it's just too much. I'm understanding about banner ads if you don't want to buy the Pro version, but this is unacceptable.",poor
It started out great but now there's video ads every time you go into the app to add a date,poor
No import/export feature.,poor
"I do understand ""free"" means accepting advertising, but your recent ads are horrible, cannot be shorten, and sometimes embarrassing. I uninstall now. Left you two stars for old times sake. *Added after Dev response. It wasn't the frequency. It was the advert that was served. I think it was some kind of Japanese pornstar (not sure cuz I was busily trying to close it, to no avail). I was in meeting with Client, checking next date, and the unstoppable advert happened. Simply cannot risk this again",poor
Has all the features I need. However the colors are NOT customizable. I edit a calendar and select a custom color but there's no change applied. FRUSTRATING!!!,poor
I've been asking the developers of this app for YEARS to add the ability for the user CHANGE THE TEXT COLOR of the day numbers in month view. The current gray color doesn't offer enough contrast when using dark themes. We also need the ability to add clearly visible grid lines surrounding the day cells in month view. Two very simple requests that go ignored year after year after year.,poor
My calendar doesn't show up,poor
"This was one of the best apps for free out there but now they added these invasive ads whenever you make a new event in the calendar and some of them are like 30 seconds long. You can't skip them until it's done. This app is now hot garbage. I don't mind ads, they need to make money but 30 second ads about making a social media account, or jump scare ads, or straight up scams is invasive and abhorrent. You guys need to find a different ad service provider.",poor
1 star (prolly less) after upgrade: U r forcing us either uninstall it or upgrade to pro. I am now regretting upgrading it without reading the comments. DAMN! Old features are already enough for me. Can I degrade it???? 5 stars b4 upgrade: This is the best calendar I ve ever used. The only thing that bother me is that this is not on the ios app store. Will this happen in the coming days because this is the only reason I am still using android.,poor
Why is it impossible to see text of event (I PURCHASED pro version and sent You email) I just resent an email ... with screenshot,poor
Update: June 2020: do not use this app free version. It recently started forcing full screen ads that lock your screen for the duration of the ad. Original review from 2018: Great app! Very customizable and the ads are small and non-intrusive. I've been using it for years and had only 1 issue that was resolved after contacting customer support.,poor
"I already paid for the paid version and now they want me to pay again for it or have to put up with ads. Not cool to have to pay again and again and again! As I said ""Not cool to have to pay again and again and again."" So when my phone needs to be replaced you have changed the app's name so I have to pay for it again. Other developers allow the user to install the app on their new phone and keep the same features they are familiar with and love. Doing what you have done creates bad feelings",poor
Used to be amazing and now ads have completely ruined this app. Thanks for the years and cya,poor
Very basic calender. Outdated UI . Not possible to integrate with Google task or other task managers. Few functions for collaborative work . MOST DESIRED FEATURE of a calender is a ability to add events and add invites from other apps and emails and thats missing.,poor
I have paid for the pro version inside this app itself. But checking the business calendar 2 Pro app I still am prompted to pay again. Why is this? Why can't I download the Pro version even though I already paid for it?,poor
Works fine but the ads are horrible. Every time I enter something new I have to watch a slow ad. I'm removing it!,poor
used to be the best calendar available until they decided to put extremely invasive ads. I know it requires a lot of work and I'm perfectly fine with ads. I'm not fine with invasive and deceptive ads trying to trick you instead.,poor
I've lost an assigment after checking the app for my events for after one year. The app showed that my date was free but it was bussy actually! At some reason the app just did not synced my events for after one year! It cost me my income for the lost event and a lot of frustraion!,poor
"Plagued with intrusive ads. Once was a great app. Now, it's useless.",poor
"Have paid for pro version. Used to be decent but now struggles syncing with Google whereas other calendar/task apps do without problem. Have now moved to Etar as its open source, free and provides the same functionality needed.",poor
There were no Ads when I installed it and now every time I put my schedule there is Ads so I need to wait. It's very annoying!!!!! I will find another app.,poor
Everything is paid,poor
"Recent update crashes the app a few seconds after launch Update: I know what's causing it. I have a root level adblock and with your new full screen ads that get blocked, it instead just relaunches the app for me. I'm not disabling my adblock for one app, full screen ads unacceptable anyway for an app branded for ""business"" use.",poor
Was good. But not keeping up with the world. Having font size a pay feature with today's high resolution displays make the text so tiny that it can't be read. So in order to use the free version I have to pay for it.,poor
"support doesn't want to fix issue in event calendar creation, or to make this optional for users to decide . there is a bug/feature which moves the event to next day when i specifically selected today's date if i do it after 23:00 . this logic is flaud , even me as software developer will not decide for my customers such a thing, and will put a msgbox ""do u want to create event tommorow?"" or at least put a check box in options to match user aspectations.",poor
Best calendar app ever. But im not giving 5 stars until we get the desktop version we have been requesting for the past 5 years.,poor
"I paid for the ability to export calendars, then import them. The problem of all imported entries being backdated 1 day has not been fixed in 2 or 3 years dispite submitting samples showing that the dates are inaccurate in the exported file Buyer beware - totally useless when you change phones you lose all your calendar entries",poor
Used it for years. Great app but uninstalled it after they added adds during editing appointments... I use a different app now...,poor
Recently a ridiculous amount of advertising has been added to this app & I'm unable to add appointments while I wait for the ad that covers the whole screen to finish. I can no longer use this as its affecting my business. It has been a good calendar for years but i will be deleting it asap. Update - the developer responded & said that an ad appears only every 18 hrs... THIS IS INCORRECT. An ad appears after every diary entry + other times too. I enter multiple entries every day so get many ads.,poor
Who's brilliant idea was to add several Holidays (which you can't even delete) that ARE NOT even US Federal Holidays to this Calendar?,poor
"Ever since the last update, I get invasive, annoying full screen ads every time I try to enter a new task. Seems that the update was designed to ruin the app experience. Horrible level of service. Really considering uninstalling.",poor
"Used to be great. Been using for 5 yrs +. Now tasks don't add, other calendars don't show data. The only event data that shows up is event data I add in the calendar.",poor
This app's reminder is always late. ALWAYS LATE. I don't know if there is a problem in my setting. But I'm really not enjoying this app. I REALLY DON'T. I thought this app will help me. Big thumbs down. 👎,poor
"Used to be great app. Now sucks, unpredictable syncing and other day not syncing Google calendar on Android 10.",poor
"Reduced to 1 star after second repetitive dev response. (edit after dev response) I get having ads, but full screen ads that you have to wait to skip are very annoying. I am fine with ads that appear at the bottom. Great app until the full screen ads appeared",poor
"BC2 won't sync with Google Calendar. Autosync is enabled, but still, events created or deleted from app will not sync with online calendar or Google calendar app.",poor
"Horrible marketing adds every time, removing the app.",poor
"Am getting reminder notification sounds, but with no notifications to dismiss. I have raised this issue many times over the years with no resolution. Happens on LG and Samsung. Various Android versions. Now on Android 10. Have to force stop the app.",poor
"Ads killed an otherwise good app. Had the old paid version too, but that went away. Dealt with less intrusive ads for a while, but now they are out of control.",poor
Had this app since July 2015 and since January it says buy pro which I have done almost 5 years ago. Support is no help I've contacted them for months with no help just told to uninstall (quick fix just uninstall) with no promise all info will return. 😡,poor
I have paid for the pro version. It works for a few months then asked me to pay again. Sent an email to the support email. They replied they have nothing to do with the payment. So who does then. Stay away guys.,poor
"I don't use the free version, I like to pay for software that deserves it. I tapped on the app today and had an interstitial ad. Do not do this again for a business app.",poor
"Hello I just upgraded to your go pro within this free version but it looks like nothing changed.. How do I get those pro features? Where are the widgets? Do I have to install the Pro app? I have to buy it again if I did that, I've looked it up already. Please fix this. I have already refund your app.",poor
"It was all going good, even the irritating adds, until today where the app crashed and all my data saved on it are gone. I'm really irritated now.",poor
Iam horrified to find that a lot of my historical data has disappeared from the app. The info is vital for my medical records. If anyone has an idea on how to retreive it please let me know.,poor
Great format-- but SUCKS due to ad popups that won't go away-- LOCKS YOU OUT OF APP UNLESS YOU PAY FOR PREMIUM VERSION!!! TOTAL & COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME/DATA UNLESS YOU PAY FOR PREMIUM....!!!,poor
"I'm sad I paid for this app. It used to be great. But now it keeps lagging and freezing intermittently, (Huawei P30 pro) I have disabled battery management, tried using original and custom launcher, but app still freezes for 5+ seconds for many actions. Nothing works, and I can't use it in this state... I have no other issues with any other apps. - scrolling in week view - creating event - editing event - deleting event Sometimes freeze, sometimes crash",poor
Never responded to my original review in 2019 and the response to my latest review still doesn't answer the fact that any tasks that are recurring DO NOT show in calendar even though you sync this information.,poor
Nope. Nope. Nope.,poor
bad. avoid,poor
"🔥 UPDATE: Only manual sync works. Down to 1 🌟 until you fix this. Best calendar out there! Love it! It looks great, works flawlesly, erganomics & ease of use is absolutely outstanding and I'm sure it tastes good as well if you could eat it!",poor
"Using the app since years, now whenever open the app, trying to save an entry, full page advertisement opens for atleast 30 seconds causes missing what more to enter on different dates, this app is at its worst",poor
This used to be a very good calendar app with plenty of good features in the free version already. Unfortunately they introduced intrusive full-screen ads recently to force you into buying the premium version. I'll rather switch to another calendar app than be blackmailed like that.,poor
"if you don't stop to force ads clip watching, bye bye.",poor
I have been a subscriber of the pro version for years when this new version came out I tried it and there were problems. I tried it again and it seems to work well. I tried running with one alarm and now it dosen't stop when I acknowledge it I'm going back to the old version. I have removed pro 2 if the problem pesiststs I will have to find a new calendar. Very frustrated.,poor
"Used to love it, now it's been an issue after issue with this app. You'd expect that it would perform at least the basic task of reading my calendars. Doesn't even do that anymore, no matter how many times I try to sync it. So much for getting the ""premium"" version. Disappointing.",poor
App starts ads after 1 month and opens wanting paid every time after the first month.,poor
It always reactivate calendar from all google account on the device and show it eventhough I have untick it in the calendar & task list. Calendar is full with unneeded event and the essentials wont show.,poor
"Best free calendar is now unacceptable with full audio, full screen video ads. The price to avoid the ad mugging is ridiculously too much. Uninstalled and looking for another.",poor
"Ads with free apps are acceptable, but fullscreen & non-skippable ads blocking the entire screen for 20 seconds are NOT. Awful user experience. Google has recently removed 600 Android apps from Play Store because of disruptive fullscreen ads, this app may be the next one to be removed. Not recommended.",poor
"Awful! At one point, I bought the Business Calendar 2 app, and I the update has ads. I'm supposed to purchase the newest version? Yeah, no thanks.",poor
"Full screen ads ruin it all I've been using this since it was just ""business calendar"". It was still $7 back then so I wouldn't buy it but would click the ads every now and then. Now with the full screen ads it's practically unusable. Also, before the dev comes in with the stock ""the free version has ads"" response: no duh it has ads. We didn't pay for the app because its upfront cost is too high so we liked the corner ads. Now you force them to take over our screens. Uninstalled and 1-Star.",poor
"Use this app every day and used to totally love it. But in the last month or so they have allowed full-page video ads to take over the screen. The only way to get rid of them is to force close the app, which I now do repeatedly. Can't continue like this! Totally unacceptable. What the heck could they possibly have been thinking. Downright stupid business decision. Looking hard for another app to replace this one as soon as I can. It was nice while it lasted.",poor
"I've used this calendar for years. It has always been the best. But now they've added ads. Unless those go away, I'll be finding a new calendar.",poor
"Waste of time, unusable cannot delete events",poor
"I used to love this calendar, but now it has full screen ads/videos that take over your phone. Can't do anything else while the pop-up ad is running. First one of these I saw - UNINSTALLED!! ... Response: The ads definitely come up more than twice per day and the calendar is definitely NOT functional while the ads are running - you must wait for the commercial to end before you can open the calendar again. I can understand bar ads at the top or bottom of a free app, but full length commercials?!",poor
Been using this app for many years. The recent update has brought ads. Uninstalling.,poor
"Those fullscreen ads made me uninstall it after years of using it happily. Bye. Won't come back. My response: Or, you know, I can simply use another calendar app that's free and has no ads.",poor
Force feeds users with video ads after each entry.,poor
"Been using this app for years, This app called itself business calendar but now includes popups which blasts the speaker at full volume. How am I supposed to use this app during BUSINESS MEETINGS?? Like the others who gave their feedbacks, guess it's time we move on to another calendar app like OneCalendar which dosent have ads",poor
"Looks polished app but time after time new issues come up. Raising these issues with the developer rarely gets timely response or interest in fixing it (I'm a paid user). Today, tasks lost their subtasks on one device, while the 2nd device is OK (for now) || to devs: Task (and their subs) used to sync across devices via Google Drive.. Seems like you eliminated this feature by switching to Google Tasks in your recent update. Totally useless app now for me (at least)",poor
I use the Pro version. But What happened to the option to purchase holidays? My Christian and Jewish holidays don't show up anymore.,poor
"Developer started to add invasive ads, and worst of all, the functionality that was working before, is not working anymore. Probably the app is busy with the invasive ad and forgot about the job at hand :) And yes, I know about the payed version",poor
Used to be 5 stars. I've used this app for years.... The sudden addition of full page unskipable adds ruined it. It looks like I'm not alone in my disappointment.,poor
NOT into your ads. I've had your app on my phone for YEARS. Uoure about to be deleted for a Google calendar. Sorry.,poor
"Do not download this app. There are Ads everything you use i (as of Feb 26, 2020), despite what the developer says about the ""18 hour"". Just read other reviews and you'll see that the intrusive Ads have killed this free app. Look for another similar app",poor
The ads are a joke. Completely destroyed the experience. Maybe they haven't tried searching for calendar on the play store and noticed the hundred other options? Look elsewhere for calendar needs!,poor
Ad heavy plus unable to use widget and stock calander app,poor
"Used this app for years, but I can not tolerate the recent full page video ads that pop up after every calendar entry. I use the free version which I know is sponsored by Ad, the recent updates allow intrusive , excess ads that you can even skip and I can't renter the app to verify my calendar entry was added/modified corrected. The developer or owner has really overstepped with the recent updates and ads. I'm going back to the free Google app instead. I hope you push out a new update before y",poor
Don't bother installing this app. The free version is garbage. Recently the developer made the decision for inclusion of ads. The ads pop up every time you add an event to the Calendar. The developer has chosen to sacrifice usability of the app and consumer comfort in the rush to monetise the app. I have uninstalled it and will not be returning to the app again.,poor
I am also looking to change after years of usage. The app stooping to advertising unless a NEW upgrade is paid is dishonest. I paid for my old version and was satisfied with its functionality. Not interested in your new version,poor
ads!!!!,poor
Ads interrupt you while adding items to your calendar. This app used to have a banner for ads at the bottom which was fine. Now the ads are annoying and timed. Reply to developer: No thanks. I rather uninstall your app completely. 👌,poor
Predatory ads killing it...,poor
Full screen video ads! I can live with banner ads but not this.,poor
"This is update on 22 Feb 2020 I don't know what happened to the app, but it now annoys me every second time i open it, with some ridiculous animated games, which hijack the whole phone for about 30 seconds, and then goes to Google Play, asking to download the idiotic game. Not sure if it's the app itself, or if it's been hacked. In either case I AM UNINSTALLING THIS! ========= Excellent app, I've been using it for many years now, since its predecessor..... all good with app :-)",poor
I used this calander app for years and found it to be excellent. But recently it started playing full page video ads making accessing information on the fly unreliable. I'm sure the paid version is still great but I cant recommend using this as a free calander app anymore.,poor
Ads ads ads.,poor
Loved it until they added cartoon ads. You'll be with a client and a video game comes up as you're scheduling their appointment. Makes us look very unprofessional.,poor
"I've had this app for years, even upgraded it to the premium version. Loved it.. then as the developers started updating, I started having many issues. Each time i used the app it would show in the premium or free version; it was inconsistent. I wrote the customer service for assistance and I didn't get any help. So i lived with it. Most recently, I started receiving ads after every entry; Not okay!! I sent another email 2 wks ago which they have not responded to; which is why I'm here. Help!",poor
"I paid for this app, and it was a wonderful app, easy platform, customisable. BUT, there has been a recent addition of ads. All the time! For an app I have paid for I think this is disgusting. I response to you, no these aren't spam events linked to my phone. I uninstalled this app and used my original paid version of the called app and there are no ads. I was prompted to update to this version a while ago. I thought it was just an ad on from the paid version of business calendar I had.",poor
"I have used this app for a couple of years now and it was great. It had small banner ads before, however recently they have incorporated video ads which play every time you input a new plan. This is incredibly tedious and a massive waste of time. DO NOT DOWNLOAD.",poor
"DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP. I used to love it, but in the most recent update the advertisements have made it absolutely unusable. I am switching to google calendar and never looking back",poor
"Its a great app I used for years. I was ok with ads, but the full screen can't be immediately banished ads make it unusable. When I need Calendar info, I need it RIGHT NOW. I'll give it a couple of weeks but if it doesn't go back to discrete corner ads I'm out. Edit post response: I'd have paid a couple of bucks for ad free version, because it is better than stock Calendar. But its not 7 bucks better. So if you're not going to remove full screen ads, after years of using, gotta say buh bye...",poor
The pop-up advertisements make the free version impossible to use. I will be forced to change to a different app after years of use,poor
updated and the only thing new is ADS. deleting after years of use over multiple phones.,poor
Paid for premium and now I keep getting ads after the update.,poor
"Misleading, all themes require pro.",poor
"UNSKIPPABLE video ads pop up when you are adding or editing an event. I mean video ads popping up in a *calendar* app is bush league already, but unskippable? May as well have a boxing glove on a spring pop out of my phone and smash my groin - that's probably preferable.",poor
"Does not sync automatically. Very frustrating. Have to go in and ""Sync Now"" even though setting is set to sync every hour. Done with this app",poor
"I am going to drop this app after years of use because of recent full page video ads which are out of control. Edited to add: of course the free version has ads. Always has, and I don't mind, because *something* has to pay for app development. But these new full page, video that can't be shut down, in your face for many seconds ads are new and intolerable. That was a bad business mistake you can correct. I hope you correct it soon. I'll be checking back to see.",poor
Since you have put advertisements in app i say goodbye.. On top of that an update came up and isn't possible to view description of booked day unless you click on it. Disappointed.,poor
"Ads started appearing whenever I'd modify something. Not cool. Edit: I have no problems with banner ads, but ads that completely disable functionality for a period of time completely defeats the purpose of using this app for better functionality.",poor
Deleting. Was great. Now horrible. Bad move with the ads guys.,poor
"Recent addition of VERY intrusive full-screen video ads has crossed a line. At first I thought my phone had been hacked! I totally understand need for revenue for a great free app, but this is too much. I'm going elsewhere very soon without a change!",poor
"The free version has HORRIBLE ADS. Other than that, the app is marginally better than Google's free calendar app that had no ads... It was an easy decision to uninstall and go back to Google calendar.",poor
I had given 5 stars in Jun 2017. I'm changing it to 1 star because of the full screen ads which cannot be dismissed. I'm grateful to the developer for creating this nice looking calendar app and was happy to tolerate the ads in the free version but the full screen ads really disrupt the process of adding an event to the point where it becomes intolerable. I'll just switch to Google calendar which syncs better anyway. Thanks for the few years of a great app.,poor
Full screen ads you can't skip every time you add or edit an event !!!,poor
The new full-screen video advertisements make the basic version of this app unusable. I'm looking looking for a replacement.,poor
"Excellent UI. Easy to use and sync to gmail. Events and tasks all at once. Since the last update on Feb 13, 2020, this app shows video ad. after modify calendar which you cannot close until the ad is finished. You have to be careful if you are in quiet environment ie meetings.",poor
I used past 5 years...Nice app .. But now More Advertisement ...so I uninstall the app..,poor
"Advertising.. Everywhere now, so bye bye",poor
"I have been using this app for many years. Definitely one of the best calendar apps for Android. Unfortunately, too big desire for monetization of the app won. Full screen ads which you cannot close are now popping up after adding events and more. Such a big disappointment! You can of course purchase the app but for me it doesn't add any more value as I don't use pro functions. I guess it's time to switch to Google's native app.",poor
"Love this calendar up until a few days ago. The ads used to be fairly non-intrusive, which I get and could totally live with. Now they have a full screen animation that you have to wait on to use the calendar. Totally unacceptable when I'm with a customer. Absolutely do NOT recommended this calendar as currently configured.",poor
Too many long ads,poor
"I recently switched over from the original business calendar app which I have been using for many years. This version has a fancier UI but functionally seems much the same as far as the calendar goes which is fine, if it ain't broke don't fix it! I think other features have been added but I don't really use them. Update: full screen ads suck. They appear and cannot be closed for a long time. Show me an ad if you must but let me close it, the free version is unusable this.",poor
Resonse (2/13/20): I know that the free version is not ad-free.  The issue that what you have done recently is to force people to watch ads instead of just clicking them away. And this happens while I'm trying to add or edit something on the calendar. Had to change from 5 to 1 star because of these pop up ads. Will be looking for a new app soon.,poor
"5 up to 15 seconds are too much for staring at an add in an app that is listed under ""productivity"". Already expecting the lame excuse given to all the comments. Please rethink if you want to go the ""standard"" way you mention, or if a developer should try to give its best and attract users. I'm in favour of ads in free app versions, but this is too much!",poor
My go to for years. Until the last update. Ads used to be unintrusive. Now you have to wait 10 seconds after every calendar update for the ad to run. Uninstalling now.,poor
"Wow. Had a 30 second ad that gave me the uninstall this app command. I used to like the 1st but eventually moved to the 2nd but after that atrocious ad, I uninstalled and used google calendar which the widget is not as nice but works great.",poor
Unskippable pop up video adds with sounds. Awful and completely inappropriate for 'business' as the name suggests. I shall look forward to deleting this app and avoiding this developer from now on.,poor
Loved this app until ads started covering the entire screen. Uninstalled immediately.,poor
"I've used this app for years and have loved it up until now. Now I get full page ads that sit there for 5 seconds and disrupt what I'm doing. I don't mind a full page ad that I can back out of or scrolling ads at the bottom, but to force me to watch a 5 second ad is not reasonable. Seems like they're forcing you to pay up or move on to another app. If this continues I'll find another app.",poor
Used to be good but started showing full screen ads even when the app is not open. Currently unusable.,poor
"I used to like, even love this app. It was great. Now though, every time I add an event on my calendar an ad comes up and stays there until it is finished. It's awful! So far the ads have not been inappropriate, just annoying. I don't think that going to the pro version would fix this. I don't even know how to find the pro version to purchase as it doesn't show up in the play store. Super frustrating. I don't want to find another app. I just want this one to work without the silly ads.",poor
"Used the free version for years, no issues, didn't need the pro features. Then they started putting in ads - not the kind that pop up along the bottom but ones that completely hijack the screen while you're trying to work. Worst bait-and-switch I've ever seen.",poor
"Used to be good. Now massive full screen adds with sound. First time they ran without warning, very embarrassing. Will give it a week to revise, then will uninstall. Adds are ok, but the full screen nature with sound isn't.",poor
Full screen ads? In a calendar app? Are you serious?,poor
"The Ads now pop-up full screen. That is very, very, very, very annoying. What if I'm on an important call making an appointment and then you pop-up this irrelevant ad right in my face. Unprofessional.",poor
After updating.. Ads took over the screen.. Disappointed.. I'll look into other calendar apps as alternative.,poor
"It used to be the BEST calendar for many years, TILL NOW, when annoying advertisements are popping up all the time. So sad, but it's totally intolerable, need to Uninstall and find another app",poor
Video ads,poor
"I don't mind ads, but not those which run in full screen mode and cannot be closed by me.",poor
Used this calendar for years without any issue. Now ads will take over the entire screen after entering an appointment in the calendar and there is a delay before you can cancel them out. Terrible and disappointing choice on the part of the developers. They've lost me as a user as I refuse to pay for a pro version for a simple calendar app. Do yourself a favor and stay away. The ads suck and are annoying.,poor
"Used this app for months with no issues but after most recent update it plays an ad every time I add a new event to my calender, awful",poor
Would you please add day and night mode for widgets that would sync with system's day and night status? Thank you,poor
"Doesn't popup reminder anymore with Android 10 update. & Revert by support claiming its purely Android 10 issue isn't true... There are apps which continue to have pop-ups (shared with developer, who refuses to acknowledge this & only give defense of Android issue)",poor
"Great app but why do you need 13 Ad trackers in this paid for pro app? Exodus privacy list 13 trackers against your app which is rediculous. Using this every day, but now concerned my every move is being tracked 13 times. Edit: You inform, so that makes it okay then, for you. Perhaps other more privacy focussed users should look elsewhere. How do I confirm the trackers are not used? Trust you, I bet.... 13 are for revenue, 1 will suffice for personalising.",poor
Can't set up reminder,poor
"Excellent app. It seems to be upgraded quite often. I haven't had any issues with this app at all and I have been using it for about 3 yrs. Importing & Exporting is a breeze. It's a great app with a GREAT Dev team keeping it up to date. Thank you. UPDATE OCTOBER 25, 2020 As you can tell from my previous review I was quite satisfied with this calendar but since the changes to the interface it's nothing but garbage. I will be contacting the developer about these changes today. See what happens.",poor
Generally it's satisfactory calendar app. Variety of features with clean and productive design. The only problem is the support. Recently there are ads quite frequently popping up in the app. When I wanted to upgrade to PRO app shows some technical issue on their side. I tried to contact support but answer was general and didn't solve the problem at all.,poor
"Long time paid user, who is very disappointed with the current version. I have had several events and tasks disappear as if they were never created. I have had this happen for months now and have done multiple tests to see if I am at fault, however, this issue happens at random. I have had events refresh then they are gone, nowhere to be seen again, ye the quick text will pop up when I attempted to make a NEW event with the same title, so it was entered in, but nothing showing. Same with tasks.",poor
"It's been more than a year since I've requested a simple feature of counting the number of hours for certain entries in a month but there's nothing yet. Developers responded saying it's not a high priority because people haven't voted on it but what they don't understand is that not everyone is going to put the time to go to their website and vote on ideas, but that doesn't mean those ideas/suggestions aren't important.",poor
"Good program, but the ads are becoming *super* intrusive. Been using for years, but I'm considering changing to something else. Edit to dev response: The ads are *not* skippable Edit #2: no, they are not, until you sit through them. Taking off a star for lying developer.",poor
"I find it very inconvenient that when I attempt to save a calendar entry, an advertisement pops up and the only way to get rid of it is to close the app.",poor
"Great app that now has intrusive full screen ads, ugh",poor
"Some crashes, new bugs, no support of certain calender supports, e.g., fails to import ics and no CalDAV support",poor
"I have the paid version of this app and it keeps, somehow, going back to the free version. I continue losing my calendar inputs. The widget frequently gets stuck at on the wrong day and date of the week and won't update unless you remove the widget and reinstall. I have been screwed over because of these issues so many times. It's a calendar widget, why does it have so many issues?! Edit: it does these after a few weeks and yes it has access to everything",poor
App just started full page ads that cant be suppressed. Dropping it after 2 years.,poor
Very crippled app and hard to know if it would work for me unless I buy full version.,poor
"What happened to my ability to use the themes? I paid for the upgraded version years ago. With the newest update my customized theme disappeared when I was attempting to modify the colors within my theme. Now I only have the hideous ""light"" version with the ugly black borders. All the other themes that were previously available are now marked ""pro"" and I have to fork over more money to get them back? There's something really wrong with this picture.",poor
Doesn't sync well and has left me out of meetings.,poor
Too many ads,poor
I will upgrade to 5* once this is fixed. I still have to update widgets manually otherwise they still think it's yesterday. Answer to dev: yes if I don't press refresh it doesn't update to the current day. Shrink content is ticked. I use stock launcher on pixel 2,poor
Used to be without ads... Now the ads are annoying.,poor
Loved the app before the ads. Now its almost a nuisance to use.,poor
Used to love this app and originally gave it 5 stars. It has stopped sinking with my phone for about 6 or more months but functioned perfectly on my phone. However for the last couple of weeks my appointment reminders only function occassionally. I've gone through the settings on both devices and cant find anything wrong. I have reinstalled the app several times but nothing helps. I can no longer reccomend this app.,poor
"The app does not synchronize events and tasks correctly with Google calendar. Often the changes I made on my desktop computer are not displayed in the app until the next day, or do not synchronize at all until I manually request BC to sync. The answer of the developer below surprised me, because (i) BC is advertised as having sync abilities and (ii) I had already contacted the developer about this issue, and the answer was ""yes, we are having some problems with Google, but we are working on it"".",poor
"I've used this calendar app for many many years, and loved it. Now suddenly the ads stop me from finishing my tasks, and I have to wait for the X to appear. That's fine for games, but this is a serious app I use when booking and planning life and I don't need it to interrupt my thought process as that causes me to lose focus and forget things, which is exactly why I need a reliable calendar app.",poor
"Agree with others that have made comments about the syncing. I've used this for years and it has never had an issue. Then pretty much overnight a few weeks or a maybe a month back something has changed. It may be and probably is a google issue, but it still makes it unusable.",poor
Does not sync with tablet,poor
"I really wish I could make this calendar work, as I am a big fan of it. Unfortunately, it stopped syncing with my Google Calendar and so it has become unusable. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it multiple times, cleared data, but still no events showing up from my Google Calendar. Edit: tried your solution but unfortunately when I removed and re-added my accounts now they don't show up at all in the app. I tried another app and it syncs fine.",poor
"The ads have become increasingly annoying by going full page where you have to wait for it to do it's thing before you can even get into the calendar. I'm all for supporting ads, but these kinds of ads that take over are the worse. And the family sharing doesn't work for this app, so will start looking for something else to use.",poor
"Meetings will not save, or show in my calendar once I input all the info. This started a week or so ago. Never been an issue before now.",poor
No longer syncs properly with Google calendar,poor
"lately been worse. latest updates have been making things worse. like when you edit the time for the event, the new way to do it is absolutely terrible and least user friendly way to select times. it was perfect and smooth before idk what changed. also no response from support for weeks now about bugs I have with notifications clearing when they should not be",poor
"The best calendar apps in Android but it just don't sync correctly, I have Google Calendar Apps and it sync flawlessly, but somehow Business Calendar won't sync correctly",poor
"Large full screen ads on the free version that appear every day and can't be removed! It's not 18 hours of calendar runtime, but every 18 hours period. If you like it (and it is a good app), you'll have to buy it",poor
The ads are more disturbing than before,poor
In response to ur reply... the reminders literally disappear. As though a person has gone into my calender 15 mins later and deleted the reminder set to 0 mins before event.,poor
Too many ads! I used to like this calendar. See my original rating below. ..... This calendar does everything I need it to do and I enjoyed this app on my Galaxy S7 phone. Now I have an S10. Only some content will sync. Is there an S10 version I don't know about? Thanks for your help.,poor
I loved this calender but it's really disappointing how often I add something and the next day it's disappeared.,poor
"Took more than 3 years, but they've finally managed to get BC2 to a similar perhaps even better level than the original. 3/10/2019.. update. Unfortunately, usability is severely compromised. Busy calendars are almost unreadable unless in day view. Tap to create appointment can drop you in very strange time slots (10:05 or 14:40). Clock to set times is backward step from BC1 which is BY FAR the best way to set times on a calendar. I like the auto link to contacts in bc2. 2 line favorites bar pls.",poor
Migrating to a new phone was completely messed-up. All my tasks were changed to all day tasks and all appointments hours were lost! Unacceptable errors!!! Calendar can not be deleted - error 'check your internet connection' despite of the fact there was a connection. I use PRO version - meaning I bought it.,poor
The new adds system is getting really annoying. Ads were a footnote in previous versions... now they interrupt what I'm doing ... really frustrating,poor
"Ads are becoming really invasive and you have to wait at least 5s each time before you can skip, see another ad, then come back to the calendar. Not inclined to buy pro with such bad user experience... Edit : And most people use a calendar app once or twice a day, so I guess dev are aiming for maximum ad visibility... I know nothing is free but this is annoying, and it's video ads for silly games. I guess I'll uninstall soon..",poor
4k 7g8 0 3rd v of. Uhuh,poor
"Advertisement is annoying frequent, and increasing. I uninstalled after couple of years usage.",poor
"I've used paid version for years and it's been great except for the occasional glitch, usually solved by reinstalling the app. But now an event is suddenly just not showing up. I've checked everything, tried sync, install/uninstall, change color of event, toggle bottom menu tabs, checked which calendar it's on, checked if event shows on google calendar app, etc. But no, the issue is with business cal. I would have completely missed this important event if I hadn't checked my calendar on my laptop. Please fix this, a calendar that skips events is useless.",poor
"This is app is something that I use only because I cannot find something better to fit my scheduling needs. The amount of bugs in the app and the amount of ads I have to sit through is beyond annoying. Not sure why they keep pushing for me to purchase something that consistently screws up because of the bugs. The biggest bug being adding in birthdays or anything that has a date, as instead of putting the date I requested it will put it a day behind or a day beforehand.",poor
"It's working, but the ads are getting really annoying.",poor
Frustrated - Popup ads have become a nuisance. Far too many. I can no longer recommend this app.,poor
"UPDATE #3 06/05/2020 ADS-ADS-ADS FULL SCREEN, AUTO-PLAY ADS w/ noise 1st Review: Many INTRUSIVE POP-UNDER links open browser subjecting us to crazy ads 12-12-18 Reply to DEV's The POP-UNDER ADS happen upon selection response to your APP message related to the action taken within your APP. I am NOT ACTIVELY SELECTING an AD. I am NOT PASSIVELY SELECTING an AD. I am NOT ACCIDENTALLY SELECTING an AD. This is either a BUG or INTENTIONALLY DEVELOPED annoyance.",poor
I really liked the app but now I'm going to have to find something else. They have started to have pop up ads that are very disruptive. I was in a meeting and I had to put in an event in the calendar when an ad popped up and started blaring music and I couldn't close it until the ad was finished. It was very inappropriate. It is now totally unsuitable for a business calendar with these ads. I was fine before when the ads were unobtrusive.,poor
It's just a basic normal calendar. Nothing special about it. But now for some reason it no longer shows holidays. Not even the kost common known ones world wide. Such as Christmas or even new years,poor
Zסב,poor
"This calendar was great until the ads. They are out of control, you can not go back, the x button does not work, and they are way more often than ever 18hrs as stated by the maker. If you can get past the crazy ads then its great but, I am over it and can't handle it anymore.",poor
Overall a great app to replace both Google calendar app and Microsoft Outlook app. Only thing stopping me from purchasing a Pro licence that has super useful and amazing features is the fact that there is no windows desktop app. ☹️,poor
Loved it at 1st and then it started going weird. Even though I purchased a lifetime I purchased it a second time hoping it would clear up the issues and it only made it worse. Tried to reach out to customer service and they weren't very helpful at all. Then you post and say that I only contacted customer service once? It was actually over 4 times I contacted you via email and most the time the e-mails I got back were so difficult to Understand and varied in suggestions that Didn't work.,poor
"What good is a calendar app if it deletes whatever it chooses to? I have used this app for years. But this last year, I have lost dates that were important for me to remember. Birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, trips, family historical events i wanted to remember pick something. This app has chosen to just drop it from my calendar as if I never even put it in. I would have given it 1 star. But it has kept some things. Looking for new, more dependable calendar app.",poor
I liked this app and used all the time. But popping up ads are now annoying me so much... I'm considering an alt calendar app,poor
"The app itself is great, but they've started adding unskippable ads. It locked my phone and forced me to go through an ad disguised as a video game where I had to shoot criminals just to make an appointment. I had no problem with static ads to support the developers, but locking my phone until I played a dumb game ruined the app for me.",poor
The ads are to loud and in your face.,poor
Really useful...untill you added ads. Now they interrupt what you're doing within the app and they are really frustrating. Were introduced a few months ago I think...such a shame,poor
New version and now I have to wait 30 seconds and watch an ad! Just wanted to take a look at my schedule today. This is unacceptable! 30 seconds!,poor
"Calendar works fine, but the adds that can't be skipped are making me furious.",poor
"I strongly recomment that you will not use this app if you use outlook calendars! Fantastic App but only for those using Gmail. With outlook you will meet various problems.I realized this after purchasing full ap. Also Tasks posiible only by Google Tasks and attachments only Google Drive and Dropbox (One Drive not available)!!! Update: After installing Blue Mail app, syncing is working smoothly... Please give solution for outlook users and add outlook tasks. If bluemail could it then yo also do",poor
I love this calendar but a few monthly ago they started adding pop up advertisements when I add an item to the calendar. Very disappointing,poor
What happened? Ever since the last 2 updates all my recurring monthly appointment show up for 2 months and then disappear. So now I can't rely on this app to remind me of bills.,poor
"2 many ads. I used this for 4 yrs and 2 cell phones no problem. I used to brag about this app lol. Miss me with the excuses about why things changed(""it helps maintain the app""). You weren't making enough and sold out I respect it but I guess I gotta do the same. ✌️ Peace out and good luck. To all those looking for a better app ""Simple Calender"" over @ simplemobile tools. I hear great things.",poor
"hi, i am not able to use the paid version to full. Kindly help me. the help and feedback is not loading itself.",poor
I'm changing my rating from 5 to 2. I've used this app for many years and I love it. It's a great app! But they have recently added add on videos (skippable but still 5 seconds long.. ) after you've created or closed an event in your calendar app. It's really annoying and disgusting because you don't have time watching adds when you want to add a couple of events everyday in you schedule... You've went to far Business Calendar 2...,poor
It was good until they introduced long adverts every time you add an entry.... How to annoy your users ! I won't be forced to pay... I have given good feedback in the past and good feedback encourages others to pay now you have decided to make the free version really annoying to use you are creating bad feedback! Good luck,poor
Pls give us dark theme cost-free so my eyes won't die using this app,poor
"I have had this for years and even have the pro version. Today the application is staying I do not have pro, when I go to on app purchase it even detects purchased but will not give access to pro features.",poor
"A few months ago it started to fail to sync with my employer Exchange server. I used to make it work manually, but now it doesn't work even if I ""sync now"".",poor
"meh I left the ""meh"" on 2/2019. Today is 3/2020. While the calendar is ok, the ""themes"" never change and, really, are not anything of interest. They really need to be completely changed. Also, color coding helps me keep track of a lot of things I have going on...the measley 7 or 8 colors they have are TOO FEW & what?! No pink?? (A nice hot pink so it will stand out). I mean, idk, I'm still just meh... 😕",poor
It started strong then the ads were a bit much but it's free and I was thinking about buying it. Then… Events that are clearly on my Google calendar stopped showing. Suddenly. Yes they’re still on Google and show on that app. I don't like that app but I might be stuck with it. I'm sorry this didn't last but I am glad the problem developed before I bought it.,poor
"The app doesn't sync after making changes on my Google calendar, even after hitting the sync now on the app",poor
"UPDATE: I know it's a one time fee as stated, that I had already paid. Same acct now I don't have pro. I've had it for a while now and had purchased the pro version right away. My reason for giving 2 star now is all of a sudden it tells me I do t have the pro feature anymore that is supposed to be a 1 time payment. 😠 Also, if there was a desktop version that would be majorly useful! Disappointed that I would have to pay for pro again if I wanted to continue those features.",poor
"I have used this awesome app for 3 years at least. Sleek, convenient, powerful. But the recent updates just bring more and very intrusive ads. If that is not reverted soon, I will have to change app. Pissed by how awesome app become awful because someone wants to make money out of other's great job. And thanks for your copy pasted answer 🙏",poor
"Have been using this app for years and have loved it. However, a recent update that includes full screen ads alsolutely kills it. I do appreciate that the developer has kept the app clean and free for the last few years. But with full screen ads, NO, sorry.",poor
"Was and is a great app. Used it for years, But now the fullscreen ads are an immediate turnoff. Small ads down the bottom were fine, but forcing me to sit through a full screen ad till the timer runs out is a HUGE NO for me. Uninstalling cos there are plenty of other free calendar apps around that don't force you to wait through adverts.",poor
55 o,poor
First I liked the free version but after a while it got annoying with all the advertisements,poor
"Its the best callendar ive used. But letely its been freezing a lot, and its annoying because i use it a lot. Pls fix the freezing. Edit. 6months have passed and this is still freezing. Why? I use my calendar a lot, so i cant keep using this.",poor
"Nice widget, and I don't mind a few ads, but persistent ads are annoying. When I get annoyed, I tend to rather go somewhere else, than becoming a paying customer.",poor
Used this app for years but the recent addition of full screen ads is too annoying. Small banner ads or something similar would be much more appropriate for a calendar app. Why would I want to look at an ad for half a minute when it should only take 5 seconds to add an appointment?,poor
"Multiclick spam to ""encourage"" upgrading to pro version.",poor
How do i go pro does this app only work with facebook I dont have face book.,poor
Please remove the annoying and intrusive ads!!,poor
"The free version was great until now, but since they added advertisements to it (e. g. forced to watch an ad after creating an appointment) I cannot recommend it anymore, it is absolutely annoying, the Google calendar is the better alternative now.",poor
What I love is that I can make multiple calendars with the same account. What are some Major problems? 1. My events are not inviting or showing up on the calendars of the people who I include in the event. Sending a text message link doesn't work either. 2. I have had events disappear from my calendar without explanation. Never had this issue with any other calendar and being a person with a Very busy schedule and multiple schedules to adhere to... This is detrimental. P.S. I paid for premium,poor
Really disappointed with the full screen adverts now taking over this otherwise great app. Will be uninstalling and choosing another alternative app (there are plenty) big mistake by the developer!,poor
After an update started showing really annoying full-screen ads. Been using it for quite some time. Will uninstall,poor
"Best free calendar app I've used, syncs with Google and outlook calendars...... ....Edited from 5 to 2 stars...the video ads are too painful. I've already read the default reply to the other reviews complaining about this. I know the fee is low and one time...I promised myself I'd get the paid versions of all the free software I use once I'm not on student income. But I'm not rewarding this painful ad practice by going paid. I will pay for a different calendar.",poor
"Since recent update adverts make the free version absolutely unusable! I understand some adds have to be in the free version, but full screen adds are very disruptive in a calendar app when one needs to work quick :/ ..otherwise the functionality it great",poor
No longer the calendar i use since the intro of annoying ads and video ads... Uninstalled,poor
Recent update causes the widget to crash every time I go to my homescreen (on a pretty common Samsung tablet).,poor
"I used to love this app but they made the ads much more intrusive, taking over the full screen with countdown timers any time you do anything. I guess I'll go back the regular Google calendar app. Reply to developer: that'd be great if you remove the terrible ads. For now I'm uninstalling and checking out other calendar apps.",poor
"You can't set a location by name, only address. Yes I tried setting my location manually, like that would be at all useful. Do you even understand what I'm saying? I CANT TYPE IN LA FITNESS AND GET AN ADDRESS. It will just send me to whichever is closest. Setting my location wouldn't help, it would just send me to the closest one to my manual instead of one that may be further... Worthless.",poor
"Wonderful app with nice visual hierarchy, but now ads take over the entire screen",poor
"I have to agree that the full-screen time-draining ads are not viable for a Business Calendar, regardless of the reasoning behind it. By all means, keep the small rolling ads along the bottom of the screen or alternatively charge a more reasonable fee to go pro. £6 is not an option when there are so many other options out there, such as aCal (which I used to use before BC and am now reverting to)... I'll keep an eye on Business Calendar though because, if you change the ad situation or make the pro price more reasonable, I'll certainly be back!",poor
"Would've been 5 stars but the new full size ads make efficiency impossible. Those kind of ads are fine when you're playing other games, but stopping what I'm doing in a completely un related app is unacceptable. I understand the banner ads to keep it running, but the full page delayed ads pushed it too far.",poor
"Lately the ads have doubled in frequency, have become full screen, noisy and more difficult to close, while the overall usability have decreased. Quite shame. And before telling the ""it's free"" slogan, think that annoyed people will delete, not buy.",poor
"It works! Does what it's supposed to do, although I don't require any features other than setting an appointment/event, and being reminded of it. Unobtrusive, even when using it as a free version only. I'll probably upgrade to PRO just to reward the developer. Edit: The new 30 second ads really screw this up.",poor
"I've loved using this calendar for years. My favorite feature is the bar view in the month calendar. I haven't found any other calendar app that does it this well. But recently they ruined the free version by showing full-screen pop-up ads that play for up to 15 seconds before you can get back to your work. I may have paid for the full version before they did this, but not now. If they're going to force uses to pay up $7 to remove such intrusive ads, I'll just move on to another app.",poor
Loved it untill recently when it started playing adds eveytime i put in an appointment. Now ill have to get a new calender app after years of using it and loving it. Too bad.,poor
Loved this app for years. The new full screen ads with no skip option is ridiculous and will likely drive me away. I understand the need for ads but this is too far and I have no need for any of the pro features so I will not pay for it when I can use a different app for free that doesn't block my productivity. I used to recommend this app to anyone who asked but now I won't.,poor
I hated the pop up ads.,poor
"App works good. But with the latest update, 25 seconds of ad.. for adding an appointment. Not recommended after the update.",poor
I used to really love this app as it provides a Todo list widget that can show a lot of Todo list items compacted into a very small space. However it has started showing full screen ads when adding new items so I'm going to be looking for a replacement.,poor
There are full-size ads that block your entire screen. Incredibly disruptive and I don't want to reward that by buying pro. There are other calendar apps out there that don't deliberately disrupt your productivity.,poor
I loved this app until the latest update. Full screen ads that you can't cancel are just too annoying. I'm outa here..,poor
"The font size is realy small and you can't change it without paying for the full version. Large font is a basic accessibility feature, it shouldn't cost extra.",poor
"This app worked well for a year. Had ads, but I was fine with that. The latest update made the ads much bigger, appearing in the task sidebar instead of banners at the top and bottom. I was annoyed but tolerated it. Then today I got a full screen video add that I couldn't close until it was through. That's too much. Deleted. Reply to reply: I know I can pay to get them removed but I don't want to support a company that pushes an update with full screen video ads you can't close.",poor
"The interface is incredible! It's the perfect organizational app I've always been looking for. This is all overshadowed for me however by the fact that it is automatically attached to your email with no way to remove it. I would use this app daily if it would just exist in it's own bubble without needing to grab onto 3+ emails. Minor complaint but it really turned me off from the app, and if I had known this I would not have used it in the first place.",poor
"Since 2018 the app does not register some of the calander input. Apparrently due to poor internet connection. Now sitting next to the wifi router and entering all my appointments for January, needless to say none were regesterred!!!",poor
"I bought the previous version and can't use this one full version if not bought too which I think is not ok Well, why would I have to kip old application? I understand but I don't like the idea to have duplicated apps. But I raised the reading to 2 starts cause of that!",poor
I love how personalisable this app is and the widget is fantastic. The weather app doesn't always work and my tablet and phone won't sync tasks even when I ask it to manually. 👎,poor
Overall it's a great app that I use every day but what I truly hate is I paid for the full version and since I have 3 Google accounts in my phone no matter what instructions I'm given by the developer it doesn't recognize I bought it because it defaults to the wrong account. If they fix and let me select correct amount I'll bump my rating back up. Should have an option. Sad,poor
"The app is not working well since the latest update (2.37.0): the app crashes a lot when creating or editing tasks, the reminder for tasks and meeting are not working (notifications are enabled), so that makes the app useless. Reinstalling the app doesn't solve anything.",poor
"Doesn't show a content of reminder on Locked screen even if its correctly set in the Settings. Fix it and I'll change my rate. BTW, Google Calendar knows how to wake up a locked screen and show notifications",poor
Gtasks Sync doens´t work. Calendar Sync is ok,poor
"This is by far the best out there but it is not reliable because if i get a new phone for whatever reason the data will not transfer to new phone (data will be lost or i will not have time to set the settings and input previous data in new phone )and that is only reason i cant trust this app. I am very upset that one flaw kills a very good app. Anyone that uses a calender heavily knows the trouble of my example. Again, by far it is a very very good calendar app.",poor
"This an amazing calender, my only problem was I was looking for a calendar for solely for my business , because this app you must sync your calendar it becomes useless because now you have your personal calendar mix with business. Useless for that purpose I can just use my Google calendar.",poor
Doubles and triples all my appointments in my calendar making it hard to manage.,poor
Buggy as hell. Keeps duplicating events when I edit them leaving me with the old version and the new side by side. I keep deleting the old one and it keeps coming back. I'm irritated and I'm going to look elsewhere now. I loved the original business calendar but after giving it more then a fair chance this version is a no go.,poor
"Actually it is a good calendar app, but on Android 10 Google calendars cannot be synched without the Google Calendar app installed on your device. You have to sync your calendar by another calendar app, or all your BC2 events will stay on your local device only. So this means, that another calendar app is required to use this calendar app, which makes this app useless at the moment. I am waiting for a fix.",poor
WHY DO notes dissapear? I pun something today and tomorrow it doesn't show up at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! To Answer:1)Yes 2)local 3) i go in the App-Month View-click on day box-write details+hour/all day.save.Then it shows up in the app and widget for a few hours and then it's gone .4) i have a stable internet connection . What should i do?,poor
Doesn't show a files attached to the event using Google Calendar.,poor
"For the Samsung Note 9 newest OS update. Customer service FINALLY figured out the problem. And it worked for about a month. Then Samsung sent out a new OS & the reminders are firing even more randomly than before. Just emailed tech support AGAIN. I have to say, I do love the app & tech support is good, but response time is slow. But unless developers can find away to keep it working no matter what update the phone developers come up with, I may have to find a more Google friendly app.",poor
"Does not sync. If i enter an item in the agenda. It does not sync with the widget. Sometimes it takes a whole day before it is visable in the widget. In the widget only 2 items are visable. The rest keep saying ""loading"" for days now. Even if i manually sync.",poor
Great for neat month view. Unfortunately it has started notifying event reminders AFTER the event? Not good.,poor
"Great app, but it just syncs to my google calendar making it redundant. I wanted to use this for nonpersonal task and keep it separated.

When you dismiss a reminder on one android device, it still shows up on other android devices.

"Very nice app with a bad drawback: today's repetition for a recurring task will not appear unless I mark yesterday's task as done! Here's how this is very bad for me:  - I have many recurring daily tasks, and it's a very tedious job to mark all my recurring tasks as done, even those that were NOT done! It gets much worse if I don't use the app for a few days! Then I have to mark all recurring tasks as done for every and each previous day!!!!  - The app forces me to record false information! A task that was not done on a specific day, should stay there as NOT done, and the recurring task should be generated for the following day.  - You have only 3 options for a recurring task: 1) to mark it as done in order for it to appear on the following day. 2) not to mark it as done, and it will never ""recur""! 3) to delete, and it disappears, and naturally, it will never ""recur""!  A recurring task should recur, regardless of marking or not marking the previous repetition as done!",poor

"Checked out this app in my quest to find a good solution for combining calendar events and tasks into a single, scrollable homescreen widget. --- Unfortunately, although the app has the option to repeat a task ""from the completion date,"" the functionality is broken.  For example, I scheduled my test task on a Tuesday and set it to repeat every week from the completion date. The app forced there to be a day of the week listed in the repeat schedule, so that it would say something like ""repeat weekly on Thursday on completion date."" --- Now, having a day of the week and also ""from completion date"" makes no sense, so I was curious what the app would do. I set my Tuesday task to repeat every Thursday from completion date and checked it off on a Sunday. The app should have rescheduled the task for the following Sunday, but it didn't. It scheduled it for the following Tuesday and completely ignored the ""Thursday"" and the ""from completion date."" --- Sorry, Business Calendar 2, but that's just not going to work.",poor

I would buy the pro option but you dont have an apple version and I will probably switch to an iphone soon.",neutral
"I subscribed to premium version and it was just working perfect I rate it 5 star but after latest update icon widget is not working. One more issue is there, in agenda view hide declined view option not actually working and declined events are keep showing for the whole day",neutral
I have paid to upgrade this app as I find it great using over years. However I wasn't able to transfer the paid pro version to my new cellphone. What do I need to do to recuperate?,neutral
The app does not support various calanders from outlook,neutral
"Month widget failed to show the calendar month erroneously, but just show a week on the first row of the calendar month weirdly.",neutral
After last upgrade widget calendar date not automatically rolling over to next day. Also the widget will not reload when the phone is turned back on.,neutral
"I used to love this app. It has great widgets and interface. However, about a month ago, it stopped syncing my work events and now they won't even appear. Turns out the account was removed. I re-entered the info and nothing came back.",neutral
"I bought the pro version a few months ago and I have been very impressed by how well it worked and how useful it is in my everyday life. I am however suddenly having trouble recently with the widgets becoming unresponsive. If I remove the widget and add it again, it works for a while and the stops working again after a few hours. I am running nova launcher on a Xiaomi Redmi note 7. Please assist.",neutral
Works well but adverts are intrusive and annoying after using for several years now uninstalled and gone back to google calendar 😒,neutral
"Used to be great, ads are now far too intrusive and unprofessional",neutral
I have an issue with the REPETITION function. Sometimes it doesn't appear. I'm using the paid version .,neutral
"I have been using this app for several years, I was absolutely happy with all the options it had in its free version. A few versions back, app started to drain my battery much faster and about the same time they added a really intrusive advertisement showing ads all the time when using it. I thought I will work through it, but no, it is very annoying, so I must say good-bye. When they stop with those ads, I will be happy to come back, but not like this. EDIT AFTER ANSWER FROM DEVELOPER: It is not true what they write - I get ads all the time, not just every 18 hours - probably because I am not villing to watch them till the end and then they always come back again. Also, skipping them via back button does not work. Very wrong concept of ads handling! No, thanks, already switched to another app.",neutral
"Devloper add all the features of Google calender apart from this app features. I request to your team devloper to incorporate the lawyers dairy for court cases updating facility as per client, court type etc in calender, then it will awesome and more useful. 🙏",neutral
Good,neutral
"Pretty good, but won't sync with Outlook cal and pop-ups every so often.",neutral
I have had some problems over time with losing calendar items and duplication of events. I ended up having to switch to outlook.,neutral
"Wish adding attachment and links are easier,",neutral
It's assistance on screen seems to display the wrong resolution when using widgets,neutral
The functions of the app is great but the video ads causes me extremely high data usage and thus money. I am ok with ads but please provide options for non-video ads ASAP.,neutral
"Edit (since I can't seem to respond to your comment): I have the feeling the fullscreen apps appear more often than once every 18 hours, although I admittedly am not sure about this. But the x icon only appears after a timer has run out, which is partially why they're so annoying. I do understand the need for ads, and that a lot of work is put into the app, and I appreciate all your hard work on it ;)",neutral
"I can't seem to think it so I lose my calendar after 3 months and all my appointments. Is also ridiculous amount of pop-up ads.. it would be better if forwarding dates, this could be 1 step. Sometimes it is, rarely",neutral
I recently signed up and paid to upgrade to Business Calendar 2 Pro but am not sure how to activate. Need advice.,neutral
"If it wasnt for the timed Ads, maybe if they were just a one page Ad I would be more inclined to use it. The fact they did that is to force you to buy the pro version. If they had not, I would be more inclined to buy it because at first when there were no ads I was really enjoying the product and considered buying pro. Then I had to wait 15 seconds for an ad to finish to save an appointment on my calendar which turned me away from using.",neutral
Missing snooze ability. Other functions work well.,neutral
Too many long advertisements when I need my calendar.,neutral
Sometimes gets dates wrong e.g religious holidays. Not as intuitive as others. Ok for basic use.,neutral
"It would be higher rating but I can't delite some events I don't need anymore.... For example: I still have reminder to pay a credit card which I don't have anymore for 2 years!!!!! If there is a way of deleting the same, please tell me, I'll give it 4 stars. Also too complicated (time consuming) setting exact time you want a reminder for an event....",neutral
"Def prefer this to Google calendar, wish it was easier to see and switch to month view.",neutral
"I was like great wit it until it erased all my schedules, then like magic gave em back 4 that month",neutral

Appgenix says ""only for the free Version"". Check with Wireshark in progress.",neutral
"It serves its purpose. I have not used too many others to compare. I wish I could set different reminder sounds. I HATE the ads after adding an appointment. Sometimes I have 2 things to add and have to wait, which is not ok when coordinating with a doctor's office.",neutral
"Every now and then appears to disconnect from certain calendars. Support didn't have an answer. Otherwise, I love it.",neutral
Great app. But it's not syncing properly. Please fix.,neutral
Hate the ads.,neutral
Full screen ads...,neutral
"Awesome until.... I was trying this app out to see if it was possible to finally break ties with my paper calendar. This app had some features that made it better than Google calendars. That is, until you had to watch an ad to schedule an appointment. Now when I save an appointment have to sit through a full page ad. I didn't get enough time in the app to figure out if it was worth it to pay for the full version but now the mandatory ads are a deal breaker.",neutral
Why aren't holidays showing up on my calendar?,neutral
"The new video ad is really annoying, it pops out, and no way to close it unless you close the entire app. It really interrupt when you want to add a few appointments to the calendar.",neutral
Ok but i hate big full screen ads with long videos,neutral
"Recently the app has shown a bug in repeat appointments. I always have repeated 3-day-appointment for Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. It starts in the evening of Friday and ends next Sat morning, Saturday evening to next Sunday morning, and Sunday evening to next Monday morning. After Monday, the appointment repeats every 5 weeks. It used to work correctly until mid 2018. Now, the Sunday-evening-to-next-Monday-morning appointment appears in the week before the correct week. Please fix it. Thanks",neutral
Est ce que vous avez une version de Business Calendar pour les laptop ?,neutral
Now you get a 30sec ad whenever you create a new calendar entry. Still an excellent calendar,neutral
The full screen ads are intrusive and seriously hinder the free version's usability. Before the ads this was a very solid and handy calendar app.,neutral
Very customizable and easy to use. Works great with Google calendar but I can't get it to sync with my office 365 outlook account. Bummer!!,neutral
Great app...new adds not so much.,neutral
"Works great, but when I start creating events and switch to a different app and go back to Business Calendar, they disappear. Also, very limited, unsearchable collection of emojis. No statistics on events, too. Would also love to see goal tracking. Needs prioritizements of tasks. Also, no option to find a time for an event.",neutral
After last update all info's gone. Shame on you. Android never more.,neutral
Paid for it 2 times keeps wanting me to pay for it again,neutral
I schedule a 9 a.m. meeting in Pennsylvania while I'm in California. But when I get to Pennsylvania my 9am meeting is now off by 3 hours. I would like the times to be fixed no matter where I am.,neutral
"Would be 5 stars, because it's really great, the best calendar I've ever used, but it keeps losing things I enter where I have poor reception. It's like it thinks it has uploaded them and then forgets them somehow.",neutral
"The app crashes quite often recently but when it works it's really useful to manage events and meetings, easy to use",neutral
"Ça fait le job, sans plus. L'ergonomie n'est pas des plus brillante.",neutral
"8/4/18 ☆☆☆☆: I'd give five stars if the weather showes in Celsius. Other than that, the app is absolutely great! I ended up getting the paid version because I felt like the developers deserved it for making such a versatile scheduling tool!! 20/1/2020 ☆☆☆: The degree still does not change to C even if I change it on Darksky. Fixing this would be very helpful especially that this has been noted almost 2 years ago.",neutral
Weather not accurate. It would be nice task have options on bottom of calendar too.,neutral
Functional but not very stable.,neutral
"App is easy to use, but there are 2 features I find annoying. When I add calendar items that I have entered multiple times before, I would like the event data to default to the same data usually used for this event - even when I'm adding an event for the 50th time, I have to overlay the time, duration & reminder. The other is that my reminders don't always remind me (take today for example) & I would like them to keep reminding me until I clear them, even if that takes all day.",neutral
It's good... marginally better than the one that is standard with the phone.,neutral
Easy to use but needs better or customizable colors,neutral
Great app when it works but don't assume you will get any support when it doesn't. Always read our help files and that is it.,neutral
"I have been using this app for years, and have loved it, but the latest version is sucking my battery. It's very frustrating.",neutral
"I'm considering uninstalling this previously wonderful app: since the last update, the widget has gone completely unresponsive...",neutral
Very pleased. Practical and clear. Upset that 1. I paid for and installed an upgrade on my phone but this did not happen on my tablet; all I get is advert for upgrade but at extra cost. 2. Tasks is accessed in 3 steps. Why not 1?,neutral
"Great overall, somewhat limited.",neutral
"Overall decent functionality but clunky execution. The premium version has good calendar functions but the notifications are spotty and don't work well with my phone, which defeats the purpose for me. The sub task feature is nice but organizing them is difficult.",neutral
"my wedget doesn't update weather, help",neutral
Latest update broke google task. Can not synchronize. Try to log out and can not add google task again.,neutral
"beautiful widgets - in Month view, I would prefer colored bars with text inside, the same as for full day events. Syncing with MS Exchange: PROS: Calendar - far better then Samsung Calendar; CONS: Tasks - completely missing (five stars down)",neutral
"Thanks for your comments. Why does Google Calendar sync perfectly and BC not, when all on the same account, I think? Some while ago, possibly due to an update, this stopped syncing reliably either regularly or even when sync button pressed in Business Calendar menu. Deleting an event on this Samsung Galaxy phone sometimes forces a sync. Sync is important as I use this with Google Calendar on desktop. Previously wrote: Easy to use and great that I can copy appointments.",neutral
I have an issue of widget stretching. Are there any debugs?,neutral
Don't have any options to manage daily expenses,neutral
I really like the sophisticated display and the level of personalisation you can make. It would get 5 stars...but....the default text colour for the month display widget is a dark grey that is too dark to read when using the dark theme. I have to go through every entry to change them individually to a light grey so I can actually read it in the widget. Any help?,neutral
"OK, it's sending hundreds of notifications with no end after an update yesterday!",neutral
"The app was working great, up until recently! Now i cant click on the date, and update it directly through the widget. I have to open the app and make changes through there. What happened! :(",neutral
Please allow line wrap for a event tile in the month widget and/or month-style display,neutral
"Was very happy with the widget, but the refresh button stopped working (outlook 365). Edit: Events from Google Calendar are synced fine. Events from Outlook 365 to mobile device sync fine, but edit them do not sync them back. Manually refreshing from the widget does noting for outlook 365. Manually refreshing in the app works without problems. These are all actions when using the device (Nokia 6.1), and not in battery saving mode.",neutral
"It's decent but the Google tasks integration is bad. It's set to hourly sync but doesn't actually update tasks unless I manually trigger it. The repeating tasks data is not synced with Google: if it's due to repeat in BC but I tick it off on a Google webpage then it's gone, no repeat. I'm also having a problem with notifications appearing later than they should. All in all, I'm going back to Google calendar.",neutral
"This app cannot be useful to me until it works with DAV synchronized task lists. For some reason it is able to load calendars from the DAVx app, but not Tasks.",neutral
Works fine for importing calendar. Can't say same for tasks. OS: Linux,neutral
"UI too complicated, not very user friendly.",neutral
Average app. No worth,neutral
I like this app and have been using it for a while but have started noticing appointments I put in the calendar don't sync to Google and some how disappear out of my calendar so I have no idea when they are. Extremely frustrating since i don't always notice the appointment has disappeared.,neutral
"I used to love this app but since installing the latest version on my new Samsung 10 the Google Tasks sync has stopped working. It synchronises from Google to Business Calendar but will not synchronise from Business Calendar to Google. ] I have tried disconnecting my Google account and reconnecting, I've made sure BC2 Tasks is associated with my Google account and all Sync settings are turned on. Is this is a known issue and if so will a fix be developed please? Thanks.",neutral
Very nice,neutral
"Overall it works, but not so easy to use. When you block out time the first and last day of the time block do not turn the same color as the rest so it can throw you off. Sometimes it's hard to set specific dates and the icons are limited.",neutral
"I'm changing my review from 5 to 3. My husband uses the same app for his work and private events so I also bought this. However, for some reason, and we've already tried every troubleshooting we can think of, his calendar private calendar won't show up on mine. Although it does show up on Google calendar. I've tried reinstalling so many times but to no avail. Only very few events of his would show up on my calendar and not the whole thing. I'm not sure what's going on 😭",neutral
"Like the app so far...but I went into the settings and changed the appearance of my ""Standard View"" to Month...yet everytime I open the app...the standard view shows Day instead of Month.",neutral
"The new update remove the option to change only one event when it is on repeat, now i need to copy and select.. And could have more colors!! Paid version",neutral
Sometimes the app will just stop working or the widgets won't work,neutral
"The feature of customization for repeating calendar/event function has disappeared. When attempting to modify, it used to asked, ""Do you want to delete all calendar/event in the series or delete this particular function?"" Except for grandfathered calendar functions, the feature of attempting to delete a particular calendar function/event no longer exists.",neutral
"Task management is a bit dangerous (can forget to enable a list). Also, can't figure out a way to view a single list without disabling all other lists (which ties into first point).",neutral
Great but over half the time when I edit a task it changes the year to the 1960s even though it says 2019 when selected.,neutral
"Ok, I guess.",neutral
"Seemed like a decent enough app, but I was looking for a calendar that worked with Google but that I could add local photos to events with, a feature currently lacking in Google calendar. Without that, didn't seem different enough to justify extra install.",neutral
Can't complete events. Must keep dismissing it or delete it.,neutral
"The app is great but the complete task list is showing on widget, I need only for 7 days. I don't know who can help me",good
"I like previous version more, much handy",good
"Add a week agenda.. Otherwise, a great app! I have been using it for years.",good
"Fantastic calendar app. Lots of of customization options. Recommended. Unfortunately, the widget I set is not holding and I have to keep selecting the specific widget I want again and again. Has been this way for the last few updates. Please fix.",good
"Suddenly, again (it has happened before), the widget is empty. I keep refreshing, but the entries vanish. Now this app has been working properly for months, so I am happy with it.",good
I love this app & have used the Pro version for years. My only complaint is that I have a P/T job that works in 24 h shifts 7a to 7a and there's no way to stop it from showing up on both days.,good
برنامه باگ The bug is popping up all at once,good
I've been using this app since the Business Calendar v1 app. I love that I can link to my Google Calendar and Google To Do items from the Calendar.,good
get new promotion to be pro short-term but app doesnt tell how long for this promotion,good
Very helpful 👍,good
Nice,good
"Like it's clarity, variety of colors",good
Good working app,good
I am a huge fan of Fantastical (on iOS) so I needed an app like it when I got an Android phone. I love the widget and I love the reminders feature! My only critique is I wish there was a simpler view for the monthly view. It's a little overwhelming to see it all the way it is right now. I like Fantastical's monthly view better.,good
"Generally great tool, nicely integrated different calendars",good
Perfect - has all the features that I need. Took out 1 star because I can't seem to add Google Meet video to my meetings.,good
Decent,good
Very easy to use. Much better than Google's Calendar app in my opinion.,good
Great app so far,good
It's pretty good aye,good
"I can't create new calender. "" Connection failed, please check internet connection""",good
Good but ads for over a minute,good
"Okay I'm sold, this app has no equal in the Play store and has all the features I always wished for. There are only two things I'm missing: option to remove the Favourite bar (I don't need it at all so it just takes up valuable screen real estate) and an option to change the text colour for the dark theme. It's just too dark. It should be white, not grey.",good
Pretty good app,good
It will be perfect if could add a button to go back to today on widget,good
I like this app a lot but still having trouble syncing the app to my phone and my husband's phone.,good
Solid,good
This is a fantastic app. I paid for the pro version after trying for a few weeks. The features are just about right for me. I switched from another paid app that I've been using for over 10 years. 4 stars because: 1. Colors set manually for events/tasks do not carry across devices. 2. Minimum task synch time you can set is one hour.,good
"Love it - wanted an app to combine Apts & Tasks from Google, with good widgets - does that & more❣",good
It's really good. Would get 5th star if it was possible to refresh the widget at set intervals. Also manual refresh of the widget doesn't work. Have to open the app to sync.,good
It would be greater if it can show also Google Reminders integrated.,good
"Its perfect to me!! except, that the postpone button looks exactly like the refresh button... This leads to a lot a lot of confusion. Maybe just replace the postpone icon with a straight arrow-->",good
Works well for me,good
Keep it up,good
"Perfect except for 1 thing. The app is great for syncing and task organization etc except for a persistent reminder option. Some apps, like bz pro, have the option where you can click on the reminder in the status bar to read it; or accidentally touch it; but the reminder won't disappear from the status bar until the user pushes a button to actively dismiss it. There is an ongoing notification on this app but the upper limit is only 2 hours after a timed task. It would be 5 stars but for this.",good
Works very well. Easy..practical..very good Game ads do pop up..its ok,good
So far no issues with the app,good
This is am AMAZING Ap.. I'd give it 5 stars but can't start week on a Monday🤷🏽‍♂️,good
I wish the week numbers could be shown.,good
"Good, reliable, mostly easy to use. Could do with a little more thought on how to enter an appointment quickly. Too many steps to do it.",good
Good app but too much ads lately,good
"Helpful and useful. However, the app has a glaring feature omission: It lacks the capability to create an event with multiple reminders. That's the reason why I didn't give the app five stars.",good
Great tool,good
Very Good,good
"Best of the rest, and I've tried most all of them. Simple yet elegant interface with lots of customization options! Update: It's been nearly two years and I still think this is the best calendar app for me!",good
Good experience,good
"Confirming my previous 4-star rating: On the whole, excellent. Can be confusing in some views, but that only needs some familiarity to cope with.",good
"So, SO, close to perfect - just not quite. It needs three things to get five stars from me. 1) Tasks should be sortable by multiple criteria, so that I can order them by date and then by priority, for instance. 2) Tasks should be nestable, with sub-sub-sub-sub-etc. tasks. 3) It should not *need* access to Google Calendar, if there is a local calendar - it should be optional, not mandatory. The rest of you, stop whining about the free version - if you want to complain, buy it first.",good
"I really like this app but it has some weird issues. Set as a widget, it'll list multiple events on the same day. Example; 3 or 4 entries as ""Independence Day"", & no way to delete them. Not linked to multi-accounts, shows all no matter what. Very frustrating. Other than that it's good for quick calendar entries, that's why it's staying. ***edit*** Going to ""settings -> appearance -> filter duplicate events"" gets rid of them. Just don't have muliltiple, exact same entries on the same date. 4* now",good
Nice!,good
Great,good
It's the best calendar,good
"Was a great great app , super functional , up until recently when the events added to the phone no longer sync with the exchange account .... Customer services reached and helped .much appreciated",good
"Good, ads are very annoying. Might delete due to ads. Why pay when I can get it accomplished without the ads",good
Awesomeness,good
Good calendar app,good
Works reasonably well but has some integration issues with Office 365 and Outlook. Also not a big fan of the format but it's definitely better than the built-in apps worth anything from Microsoft,good
"Amazing calendar. Both the light and dark colour version are good. Just one suggestion. The sync has to be more fast, with other calendars. Sometimes the sync is little sloppy, that can be a easy fix. Thumbs up!!",good
"Very good, but I just wish it was easier to copy an event.",good
"I've had this app on my phone for many years, but lately it has been getting worser and worser. My main issue is that changes in events, especially recurring events do not synchronize and I have missed deadlines because of this. It's no longer trust worthy. Google calendar works find, so until this synchronization issue is fixed, I'm back to using Google calendar. Update 24-08-2020: Synchronisation of ""changed"" recurring events seems to be beter today; fingers crossed. I've updated my rating.",good
"Works well, updates and time changes are sometimes tricky.",good
Best calendar I've found. More options for display and inserting content would make it perfect,good
"Is a great app,but it will be more if some imocon can be added!",good
Very good,good
Good program. I do not like the fact that months scroll up and down. This causes some confusion.,good
Please add delete option in notification.,good
Been using this for years. I am still trying to figure out how to import my work google calendar.,good
"seems to be a pretty good app for me so far have used this app for a good couple years now no problems, and I use this instead of the one that was installed on my phone. Samsung Galaxy S7 Update aug/2020 still loving this app still working good keeps my reminders I set for bill payments and also Dr's apts etc. Helps keep me on top of everything I highly recomend this app for your phone it also has options for upgrading if you want it's great!!!! :)",good
Exceeeelllaaaannntt,good
Works fine,good
Great Way to Maintain Appointments,good
Adverts are very annoying and totally irrelevant for me,good
Really cool but UI could be upgraded to look more sleek and its actually quite slow but maybe thats because of mh older phone model,good
"You have to adapt to it, but it getting better",good
Easy to use,good
Helpful and useful application. It is a pity too much options are in the paid version,good
Satisfied. Best app to use for multiple calendars. I could easily control which calendar I would like to see. Especially during vacations. Office calendar stays hidden.,good
Great calendar! Would recommend!,good
Where can I turn off am-pm time format? Here where I live 24 hours format is used and all that am-pm stuff irritates too much. I haven't found this option in settings. In previous versions was 24 hours format.,good
"Useful app. Runs smoothly, able to sync to multiple calendars, invite participants, set recurrent events. Notifications setting maybe a bit buggy, was unable to turn off the notifications in my email.",good
Pls make agenda scrolling in the widget possible again. Galaxy S7 +++ CM Launcher +++,good
Keeps pushing me to rate the app even though I already have (and gave you 5 stars) LOSES A STAR.,good
"Runs smoothly with all my mailing programs at a time: outlook, Gmail, roundcube. Maybe a little design update needed, but the best mailing app I have used so far. An integration of Google maps for addresses of meetings (in the premium version at least) would be nice!",good
"Better reminder system is needed. Setting do not seem to ""stick""",good
I've had this app for many years as it used to be the best. It's had some difficulties the past couple but they are improving again.,good
"Update: still like the app, but now there are annoying timed ads stuck in after saving or editing, so I am taking off 1 star. Very customizable including the widget. I can make it whatever size i want and show me what is coming up at a glance.",good
Great,good
Needs a backup system,good
Wish it wou.d sync better to audio all calenders that I have in google,good
Very useful. Clearly laid out. Update in 2020:. Excellent app.,good
Sometimes doesn't synch over devices.,good
"The calendar should be able to set up recurring events easier. Updated: The calendar still makes it difficult to define a recurring date that occurs on the 3rd Monday, 1st Thursday, etc. It should be more intuitive. Also, it should allow you to define the event type better instead of just birthdays, anniversaries, etc. A custom event type that is user defined would be nice, like job anniversary, named day, National BBQ Day, etc. How do you import a list of holidays from a file (HTML,TXT,XML) ?",good
"The most feature rich, highly customizable calendar offered today. However, I wish I could add non holiday events like Mother's Day, Father's Day, Valentines Day, etc.",good
Great app with regular updates,good
Integrates nicely with all calendars,good
Much better calendar then the one that came with the phone.,good
The best ever.. Only bug when ur restart ur mobile,good
Good,good
"Just paid for this app. Latest update, I've lost some events in 1 of the 4 Google calendars I view. Those events show up just fine in the Google Calendar, and used to show up o.k. My free Business Calendar. I see you did an update July 20. Maybe there is a bug in that version. I tried stopping the app, cleared cache, cleared all data, started over. Still missing some events in one calendar. Refresh/resync doesn't help. All events showing in Google Calendar. Shut down, restarted phone, not fixed.",good
Sometimes widgets don't update themselves and stay the same day.,good
Great app. Pulls together lots of info that keeps me in-the-know and sane.,good
I really like this calendar. It syncs well with my Google accounts - better than other 3rd party calendar apps I've tried. (I've only used the free version),good
Nice app,good
"One of the few android apps I've been happy to pay for, and never regretted doing so!",good
"I like that it keeps more than a years worth of data. For the most part, it is easy to use. The main complaint is having to struggle past ads fairly often. The good thing is that they don't last long. Ads are always irritating. It never used to lock the screen with ads.",good
😏 good,good
It has been working well with the exception of syncing. I have to manually do that once a or more.,good
I like this app. Hope you habe this on IOS,good
"Bought the pro version and it does the job. Only improvement I would suggest is an indicator showing how long a timed profile has before changing. Also, what it will change to.",good
Awesome,good
I would appreciate have notification alerts in my lock screen...( android 10 ),good
Nice,good
"Very good app. The synchronization with outlook is not always happening, somehow, but it is generally very reliable.",good
Great without the ads😉,good
I've been using this app for about 2 years. I like the way you can customize so many aspects if you want but it is simple to use out of the box. I use the widget almost exclusively.,good
"I love this app, but have one major disappointment - when I input something in the calendar that lasts more than one day, it doesn't show a solid bar of colour from day 1-last day. Usually at least the first or last day (or both) show up as a separate event. It is very annoying and confusing.",good
"Really good calendar app. I like that they have now added a larger range of colours. They took away a feature I used and I don't use everything available, but it's easy to use and I'm keeping it :)",good
Still enjoying this calendar app... but would like it better if it was a little more intuitive 😇,good
"Not a big user, but my use is very satisfactory",good
"The only problem I have is I really really miss the pop-up reminders, hopefully that will be brought back. But still by far the best calendar app I've tried. I used the original business calendar since it was first released many years ago.",good
Very Good,good
People,good
Very good app,good
"Simply the BEST Business Calendar, I have use for ordinary and very Busy People",good
"I've been using the pro version for ages, but it's been very disappointing with the function to make edits to an individual event that I've created as part of a recurring series taken away. If I want to edit it (just to cancel or change the time for that 1 event), I'm given only 2 options; you can either change that particular event as well as all future events in that series, or all events in the series. It's frustrating and time consuming to delete/create the series again for just that 1 edit.",good
The month pop-up in weekly view doesn't work... Not sure why... Otherwise I'd give it 5*.,good
Sangat membantu untuk mengingatkan acara2 penting..,good
Very good,good
"Top of my wish list is ability to copy and paste events. Other than that, great app.",good
So many features and options! Does not support Google calendar reminders.,good
"Great App I can't live without. Just wish they would apply the HTML Code in Tasks so that I can write in bold, italic, etc and I can drag appointments around in Agenda View of the calendar. Good work guys. Keep it up!",good
Extremely smooth start and sync. Including reverse sync from app to calendar,good
Good,good
Easy to see event on gadget.,good
Very handy 👍,good
"Having problems. The app is not syncing anymore with my Google calendar. I double-checked the settings gs and permissions and tried to force a sync, still no good. It is set to auto sync every 3 hours. Edit: changed from 3 to 4 stars. I appreciate the suggestion to try and help. It didn't fix the issue. However with my new phone the app is working seamlessly. Very easy to use, lots of customization, visually easy to read. Thanks.",good
Does exactly what it is needed for.,good
Works really well,good
"Incredible, the best app of organization.",good
Only complaint is the ads. Weren't there till 2020.,good
Works well,good
Good experience,good
Love it,good
"I've been using it for a couple of years & it's worked well for me. I like being able to set reminders on tasks, something GTasks doesn't do by itself. I did spring for the paid version since i use it pretty heavily and to get the all-in-one widget. Worth it!",good
"Very good app. Helps me keep organized, and does not let me forget anything. Also, syncs with the google account so I don't miss any dates. I would only suggest that they change all the tasks paid options to the free app, so we could have the opportunity to compartimentalize the complex tasks in projects and also to repeat the tasks daily or weekly, to achieve milestones and to track them. This app would become exceptional and dependable. Thank you, I know you will ponder my suggestion 🙏🏻😊",good
Very useful. Easy to plan daily schedule. Please keep on improving.,good
Love it. I'm self employed with several appointments a day. Being able to see my appointments at a quick glance is really helpful and a must for me.,good
"This is the best calenders and task combination, I've found so far. I very much like the feature that allows multiple reminders. Syncing with Google calendar is still in development. Even though both allow tasks, subtasks and reminders, the syncing is not yet perfected. It would be great to see this done.",good
Good app. Let's you to add yearview which is unavailable in Google Calendar. I am using it for four years.,good
"I would have given 5 stars if it was possible to sort tasks manually. I have been waiting for this feature for so long! Other than that, you really have tons of useful features 🙂",good
Exactly what l need and what l have been looking for... very easy to use. -Zimbabwe,good
Early I was able to register birth date in 'Birth Day' reminder and it reminded on the day with the age. As 'Mr Satish age 55.' That feature is missing.,good
Still using this app every day. Some of the best with frequent updates. Kudos to the developers!,good
Good.,good
Much easier to read than Google calendar,good
I like how it works. Though one massive thing I can't either figure out how to do (which is more likely the case). Or you just don't have a repeat of the same event without having scheduled it 6 separate times in one day. Like eat 6 times a day. Supplements 8 times. I think you get it. Other then that it's perfect for work. Quick and easy for me to keep my clients in there own lane and me on time.,good
"Lowered to 4 stars because still can not use CalDAV to sync tasks, so they are only on the phone. Don't break the phone. Or you can use Google tasks if that's enough for you. Otherwise it's very good. I'm moving away from Google and this does do calendars via CalDAV. Use DAVx5 to sync.",good
Good,good
"Cannot get any of the other calendars to show up other than my Gmail calendar. They're listed in the settings, I've got them checked, but nothing shows up on the main screen.",good
"Displaying the ""Contacts"" calendar of every Google account cannot be deactivated in Calendar & Tasks list (it re-activates immediately).",good
"I have a built in calendar in my phone which i use for personal use. Then i downloaded this app which i wanna use for business purposes. But whenever i add an event, it will linked to my personal calendar. How can I separate the event, only in my business calendar? I dont wanna mix all together",good
"Great app! The only thing I miss is syncing tasks with other accounts than Google, like CalDav.",good
Good,good
My go to calendar,good
Hi. When will it be integrated with the dark mode setting on your phone...?,good
"I've been using the paid version for several years now. The calendar is well designed and I enjoyed everything it can offer. Recently though, there are sync issues with my google calendar. I sometimes have to do it manually.",good
One or two interface aspects I might wish to adjust. Would like event status to be reflected in it's display. Would like events to reflect their event-type category.,good
I like its efficiency Leaves me with a sense of confidence that once entered will remind me when it should. Completely satisfied.,good
Great for keeping track of events and appointments!,good
"Helpful although or right because I am still the kind of ""fountain pen letter writer""!",good
Best I could find for my needs,good
I really like using buisness calendar. Whats missing for me is a windows version with an option to sync between phone and pc.,good
"Bought the paid version and this was working exceptionally well until recently. My Gmail entries now only appear for the last two years, or so, and not beyond. The Google calendar shows them all, so not sure why it's not synching fully.",good
"There is a lot of good in this app, but I want to mention places that need improvement. There needs to be a setting for how often the app syncs with your calendars. Also, if you change a meeting time in outlook it doesn't seem to update in Business Calendar.",good
"Nice interface, simple to use. Good widget.",good
Great,good
"Nice app. Although, the full screen ads are pretty annoying.",good
I was using this app for years and I'm used to it but those ads are so annoying. It's sad for me to look for other options. You should leave those ads out,good
Very Helpful and Reliable,good
Very good.,good
I like this app a lot,good
Pretty good calendar app. I like the layout of the Samsung calendar app a little better but this one has more features.,good
"Great calendar, although the long and often advertisements get a little much though",good
Good,good
"Did what I wanted it to, and i paid for the pro version because it was pretty easy to use and i think developers deserve the support :) Only gave 4/5 stars because it's not very aesthetically pleasing. It's plain and i wish they had more options for themes, colours ans fonts.",good
"really like this, but how do i take off the holidays, i have gone to all settings cant find how",good
Very good app,good
Much easier to view than most .,good
works well but wish i could delete public holidays that are not relevant for me,good
Calendar shares well but drops previous dates too quickly.,good
Easy and quick to update,good
"What happened to the setting for choosing how far in the future to sync calendars? The app on my phone is only showing events for 1 month in the future, and then the calendar is blank. There are many events much further out than this, that I can no longer see on the app. I've been through the entire menu tree and no longer see the setting for length of time to sync.",good
"Like the app, purchased it, keep it up.",good
Ok...,good
Good app,good
Very pleased with the interface and overall functional capabilities of the app.,good
The best calendar application. The only improvement area is quick sync. It doesn't sync as quickly as Google calendar.,good
"Works well, but is not perfect",good
Have used for several years now and have been very happy with it.,good
"Very user friendly. I'm not very ""techie"" but this is easy.",good
Good deal and good function,good
"AMAZING APP!! I have a very high profile job and with this app, I keep all of my appointments and my work schedule in sync and current!!! 5 STARS!!!!!",good
I am very happy with this app,good
Good one. Like it.,good
Very good,good
Superb App! Once you try this one you won't be looking for another. Not just for business! Works for personal use as well.,good
I prefer this app to the built in calendar.,good
It has the best agenda / to-do list widget i have found so far,good
Using it for years and it's still great!,good
"Excellent and one of the best. I have used. I bought the premium version, well worth it.",good
I love the variety of settings and options,good
I have tried a number of calendar apps. This one is the best.,good
"WARNING TO SAMSUNG GALAXY USERS! I love this app. Unfortunately, I just installed the system update from Samsung today and it completely wiped out EVERYTHING on this calendar and the calendar on my phone. I don't know how to fix this, hopefully customer support on this site will be able to help me.",good
Excellent for business meeting,good
"Nice, clean",good
Does what it says - reminds you even after the programmed time for some reason I don't understand.,good
I won't go looking for another Calendar! This app is innovative and functional. It is very well supported too. Whoever is behind this app is a professional who deserves great respect.,good
Great app!,good
Better and more customizable than Google Calendar if that's what you're into. I love the widgets they're clean!,good
This is a great calender that's easy to customize and integrate with everything in your life!,good
Gives me exactly what I need to manage my busy life!!,good
Very useful,good
very good,good
I love this App. Helps keep me and my 23 color coded Google calenders organized.,good
Very useful.,good
Cracking product,good
"Really great app.. Manages All my calendars, Easy to use",good
Update 2020: still an amazing calendar app!,good
Great app,good
I bought this app some years ago and stopped using it because it was not compatible with my work exchange account. Productivity was way down because of using a multiplicity and some really bad apps. Now it supports it and I am using it again. And I love it every bit as when I left it. Thanks so much for this app! I got an issue with the hide calendars bar though. It shows entries but I cannot delete entries from the menus..,good
Great,good
No complaints 👌. Works as advertised.,good
Swell.,good
"Best Calendar App, ever! 4 years later, and its only improves. Excellent developers who are responsive to feedback, I'd pay for it again!!!! Its that good!!",good
Love it,good
Integrates Google Tasks in calendar,good
Great app,good
The widget is most useful feature. It reminds me of appointments for the next 48 hours,good
Simple and easy,good
"Seems all good. My main calendar , very good and versatile .",good
Works as it should .,good
Best customized calendar,good
A great calendar!,good
Very pleased with app. Easy to input appointments ets + good screen layout + more...,good
Beautiful and useful app,good
Amazing! I use it to keep track of bills/work/events and it sincs to my ipad as well :),good
Amazing app and real value for money,good
Excellent,good
Excellent product,good
No probles....good experience with this calendar so far.,good
I like it so i bought the ad free..,good
"Used it for quite a few years, decent app, always room for improvement, but it works well.",good
一目了然，顏色也夠多，確實把行程分門別類出來，只有每天早上第一次使用時有廣告，後面都沒有廣告，非常實用，用幾年了,good
My every day reference. Fantastic.,good
my far,good
Best calendar app out there. Super reliable and has all the features you will ever need.,good
Excellent app.,good
Works very well. Easy interface. Great features.,good
"I have used this cal and predecessor for many years with many accounts. And I like it's flexibility, description history, geo history, colours and look and feel flexibility. It is very well made. I use a full size panel on one page of the phone, and it shows me everything. Good grip on what I am doing and planning.",good
Excellent. Loads of features - tried lots. This is the one!,good
"Great app, lots of updates",good
Excellent features. Very clean design. I especially like the task management and (birthday) age features.,good
"This is one of my favourite app on phone. Widget is on main page, full size. I would like if it has reminder integrated, or alarm sound connected with tasks. Sometimes notification is not strong (or bored) enough to remind me on an event/task.",good
Well done a spiffing app. Try this if events dissapear. Here are the steps I followed: 1) Swich ON Airplane Mode 2) Clear Calendar App storage & cache > Settings > Apps > Calendar > Storage > Clear Storage 3) Clear Calendar storage at system level > Settings > Apps > See all > Menu > Show system   - Calendar Storage > Storage > Clear Storage 4) open calendarVerify that all events are gone 5) Swich OFF Airplane Mode 6) Start Calendar everything should sync after a few minutes.,good
Great app with plenty of features. I've used it for several years and never had any issues. Highly recommend.,good
"It's a calendar app. The job is pretty straightforward, but it does it very well, quickly, and in a nice interface. Specific items: syncing with Tasks is great. Syncing with other to-do apps like TickTick would be dreamy, but that's asking a bit much. Being able to set defaults for making new events is good. The color scheme is nice and not all blinding shades like many apps, and I love how customizable it is. I haven't used event ""Groups"" but it looks like a great feature. TLDR great app",good
Very helpful app!,good
Great app. Steps up phone calendar with colors and features.,good
Excellent planner,good
"Excellent. Simple as that. However it does have a big problem still... It only takes 3 simultaneous events to make 1 or more of the events disappear from view. You can reveal the missing one by hiding non essential calendars. Otherwise excellent. Really appreciate the ability to set multiple alerts for an event. E.g. 1 week ahead, 2 days ahead and day before.",good
"I bought the full version purely because the devs put so much effort at delivering such a great product that I felt an urge obligation of expressing my gratitude. I truly, deeply thank you guys for such an outstanding app.",good
Good,good
Good app,good
Awesome,good
"Every updates is great, I don't use all the features but the updates only improve the stuff I use. Never had a problem with updates. Great app!",good
"Ever in love with Business Calendar 2! It's configuration settings are of sublime finesse. For example, you can move events in 5 minute increments or even 1 minute increments. It's especially useful when moving events, as it's better than other options do on both desktop and mobile applications. Would utmost recommend to those seek a power-calendar app!",good
Great calender,good
Good,good
"Just works, perfect 👌",good
Nice,good
fantastic reliable app. Keeps everything organized.,good
I've had this app for a few years now and I love it! I use it everyday and prefer it over anything I've used in the past.,good
This is the best calendar I've found with emojis. It is very useful for my teaching schedule.,good
Excellent calendar. I have already suggested to developers to provide the calendar events MS Excel format also.,good
"Great app, and was happy to support by purchasing premium. The way the tasks work are better than any other app I've seen",good
Very Good,good
"Please add Tasker compatibility! Android 10 has crippled this app's effectiveness, and Tasker can solve this, plus add unlimited customization options. Pop-ups are a must have feature!",good
"Have been using this for years. Wipes the floor with the standard Google Calendar app in terms of usability and functionality, but also syncs perfectly with my Google Calendar. It has by far the best and most customisable widget of any calendar app I tried, which was what drew me to it in the first place",good
The best I ever used!,good
"Well...till now, I've used it for a quite a while, experimented, played with features, and have found it very functional, intuitive and quite simple to master, as you go. It has allowed me to integrate two different calendars and scheduler, to a point I can see separately each, two, or all three, at the same time. Very convenient. As I've learned, with a touch I can see either of my two calendars, both at the same times. I can isolate my 'to dos', I can Isolate to see just holidays! Or see all!",good
Have been using this app for 2 years. Very reliable and is as feature rich as you need it to be. Highly recommended for someone who lives and dies by a schedule.,good
Lots of great info in one spot!,good
Still the best! I've tested many calendars and this one has the best layout I've seen.,good
"Excellent Calendar, I use it everyday. I used to use the free version which works fine, but after realizing how much I depend on this app for everything, I bought the full version. Full version has many nice options. Overall really usefull calendar, can invite others to events, has tasks, birthdays, many colours and icons to choose from for my fellow organizer geeks. A+",good
Best calendar app!,good
Great! Get it!,good
Exceptional. Flawless. Absolutely has to be the best calendar out there. Have been using and enjoying for 7 years or so. Buy the Pro version. You will love it.,good
Using it everyday obviously !!! Super stable.,good
My best calendar app. It has everything I need. The only missing thing is the split view (month and events/tasks list).,good
"I like it. I can use it for all my accounts that manage calendars, and also filter them very easily. If I didn't know it, i would like someone recommended it to me ^_^",good
"Awesome app. Fullfil all of the requirements. Some small features if added 1) make overdue task have separate color in widget to differentiate from today task. 2) there should be an option to make task from subtask only, no need to have father task",good
The best calendar. Period.,good
"10/2020 still using both phone and pc versions. Syncs enough to be useful, but still a bit buggy. Problem is that there isn't anything better that I can find. Still does the job. Old review: Like that it syncs with pc calendar. Like the color and holiday/birthday options. Don't like that birthdays don't sync from phone to pc. Had problems with syncing at all until unchecked calendar on pc version.",good
Best calendar app.,good
I've been using this calendar app for years. Haven't found any other user interface that comes close.,good
I have used the app for many years and I really like it I tried a few other app but I always came back to business calendar great app Bc I just do,good
Great calendar,good
Great app! Have been using it for a few years now with no major issues except that sometimes it misses some appointments when syncing external calendars from Google. Anyway to fix it? Thanks!,good
I have been using this app for years. They have personalized tech support. Very responsive. It works with all of my Google calendars from multiple accounts and lets me see everything at once. It creates templates so I don't have to work so hard to reenter information. Love this app.,good
Happy user of many years. I use it to keep my day on track.,good
"SYNC ISSUES??? Here's how to fix it on Samsung Galaxy products (Tablets, phones,etc). You will need both Google calendar app and Samsung Calendar. Check both of these to make sure they are syncing. Google calendar and Samsung calendar will over ride Business calendar. But it appears data is taken from Samsung calendar for BC2 pro. And Samsung calendar takes data from Google calendar.. so make sure all are synced...lol. Ya its a lot of work - sometimes they are functioning fine. But this will help you if they don't cooperate. Don't be upset with the developers of BC2 Pro. .They don't have a say in the matter as these big companies have big ego's and BC2 Pro can't do much about it....EXCEPT THIS - BC2 PRO - IF YOU ARE READING THIS - Please create your own calendar system to sync accross platforms. so we don't have to rely on google calendar and samsung! Lets just stay within the BC2 platform. I will happily ditch google calendar forever if you make this happen. You guys rock! Cheers.",good
Great app. The widget keeps me in check with all appointments,good
Great app! This is the only app I use or need.,good
Simply the Best 😜,good
does precisely what it is supposed to do,good
Never had a single issue or complaint. Does what it says on the tin.,good
Very handy,good
Used this for 5 years. I love it.,good
"I wish this app had an option to move the line dividing each day above the date, (below the last event listed) not below the date.... it can be confusing to determine if the line is separating the event(s) for the specific date or for a date in the future.",good
"Even with adds, great, dependable, east to use calendar.",good
I would be lost without it.,good
"Great app. The free version offers all the features I need and more, integration with google calendars is seemless and I rarely have issues with the app. I'm not a fan of the new ad format, but I admit it was short sighted of me to initially give a 3 star rating because of that. I am changing it now to 5 stars, because this is still by far the best calendar app I've used!",good
This app is wonderful and an integral part of my phone and my day.,good
"Excellent calendar translation with good, functional widgets, recommended.",good
"Love this calendar. Ease of use to add, move and delete appointments, different colours, linking accounts. Love it so much that after a year I moved to the paid version. I would love to see fun backgrounds though. Cheers!",good
Been using for several years. Great app.,good
Guys.. the sync with google keeps failing recently... What's wrong?,good
Easy and clear,good
Update on 2016 review - BC still works best. Have Pro version - well worth it. Love the week view which allows you to see EVERYTHING - a must for my appointment driven life. Other calendar apps tried didn't do the week as cleanly or at all. Happy user!,good
This app is the one that is completely necessary to keep things in order!,good
"Best calendar app for android, agenda widget is simply must have!",good
"Tried various calendars, needed one with Google task support. This was the only one I found that did this reliably. Easy to use.",good
I was looking for a calendar app to use with my new Pixel 4a and now I have found it. Two thumbs up!,good
The best calendar app!,good
Perfect and support replies quick,good
Great App,good
"The widgets have made it so much easier for me to stay organized, and I appreciate the level of customization as well. Very useful and one of the best calendar apps I've used.",good
Great,good
"Definitely worth the money. Easy to use, intuitive, multifunctional and surprisingly versatile.",good
Great,good
Terrific!,good
I'm one of those people who needs as many settings as you can possibly squeeze in one app. And I'm happy. Thank you so much,good
I used to miss appointments with the phone app. Even though I am still adjusting to 3G business calendar I am satisfied with it. It will continue to get better for me. Thanks,good
Love it,good
"Great app ! So great it is actually the first one (and only one so far) I bought ! I love the clear, thoroughly customizable interface and the widget on Android is super practical. I have 1 small complain though: when I set new events, they often tend to start at XX:05, rarely on the exact time (xx:00), any fix ?",good
5-star product undoubtedly and unconditionally! One of the finest apps of the store IMO,good
Top product. Using it for years now. So customisable. Love it.,good
"Very flexible, does what is supposed to.",good
"I have tried every calendar app and this one is by far my favorite. I recommend it to all of my friends. Easy to use, I love the template feature, that I can have many different calendars and favorite calendars, and that it syncs Google calendar.",good
"Good, what else I can say Спасибо Gracias 2020/10/5/0528",good
"I'm so impressed I had to write this! I have never used such a comprehensive calendar in my life (and I'm old) I never write reviews as I really feel its a waste of time. Well this time I am willing to waste my time, to say this is a simply amazing app and I have ran businesses for 25 years and have come across a lot of software. Thanks guys! P.S. buying the pro when I get home today, Not because I need it but I do think I owe it to you! Thanks Keith.",good
Excellent,good
I really like the task lists function. It helps me organize the tasks for my work and personal projects separately so it only gets as cluttered as I want it to look at one time lol,good
Awesome,good
My chaotic life revolves around my schedule. This app is perfect for organizing the choas,good
Great job!!!,good
Beautiful! Best ever calendar app which satisfy my needs. Even free version is great,good
Excellent calendar five stars,good
Still is the best calendar! I have been using this for at least 8 years now. It is the best calendar apps bar none. What more can I say?!,good
"Its a calendar and it works, really I'm not too picky. Except for camera gear, good quality lenses will make or break you. Never use the plastic kit lenses for professional purposes. Lighting is also a major factor in images",good
Very useful app,good
Superb calander app I have found so far,good
Adding A PICTURE 😁👍😁 to an event is worth a 1000 words. BC2 can do it,good
Excellent . Thank you ...Well dedicated work,good
Excellent clean calendar app.,good
I've been using this app for 4 years now. It's the best but the interface is a bit tired. I'd like to see more gesture support like the Samsung or Google Calendar but it's still the best!,good
Te amo don't re ftyxx up they were C f de Leon if,good
Fantastic calendar. So much better than the Samsung calendar that came with my Note 10+.,good
This app has absolutely increased my productivity. I use it everyday.,good
After 7 years of using Business Calendar it no longer allows me to insert new events. Is there a problem? Please advise.,good
"Me like. But one thing I don't like is if you schedule something over a couple of days. If you block out 8 hours in a day, the entire day looks occupied. But if you block out several days, it's just a little sliver along the top of the day entry. That makes no sense to me, I want the entire day to look blocked out.",good
Great app for organizing schedual,good
Very good,good
"Love this app, easy to use, integrates seamlessly",good
Does everything I need to do with a calendar.,good
Very good all around.,good
"A very user-friendly calender app, has the right features, would recommend it to others!",good
"I don't care for the calendar app since Google Calendar is superior, however I use this app for the widget, which can be customized to be simplistic.",good
Been using it for years for my CalDav calendar on OwnCloud. Works great.,good
"Negative: increase of ad's, everywhere!! Good: This calender allowed me to organize my day in a clutter-free manner. I was specifically looking for 1 feature: I needed to be able to categorize or tag each event and then be able to toggle them on and off as needed. So, I can turn off all birthdays or repeating events or work items or whatever, OR only see that item. This app allows you to categorize each event as needed. It's a bit tedious to update all of your events but later it's simple.",good
"Use this app every day , have no had any problems",good
"Very helpful app , now i can manage all of my day tasks from my mobile . It help you to remember all of your tasks . Thanks for this app . I tried to go premium , but some error appears on the screen , please help me to go premium .",good
"It is profound, very flexible & easy to use dependable app. Yet still needs improvement particularly calenders should be more flexible and user friendly!",good
Great tool to stay organized,good
Updating my review to 5 star since I was able to get back my Pro access.,good
Love this app. Keeps all my appointments straight. Couldn't function without it.,good
Solid calendar alternative and better with Play Pass.,good
Perfect for my daily routine!,good
Easily the best and most customizable app of its kind. Pro version well worth the money. Highly recommend.,good
The best calendar and task app ever! I used it for many years now. It has a lot of features and customizations and it is still easy and intuitive to use! They keep adding new features and improvements all the time!,good
Great app,good
Good,good
"I bought the pro version years ago now. Have consistently used it across various Galaxy S series devices. If ppl having issues u need to dwnld Google calendar, set calendars & accts etc through it, sync then set calendars in settings & sync BC2. Turn off google cal notifications so u don't get 2 & allow bckgrnd/don't optimize in BC2. These are all android 9+ OS if you use any battery saving setting on your device. Really, this is the most stable & consistent app ever. Backup settings to Drive.",good
Great app,good
"I love this calendar. It is so easy to see different categories/types of appointments, very useful.",good
"UPDATE: 5* still. Note20 Ultra. UPDATE: 5* again. Note8 now. Long time user here, on Galaxy Note4 now. Love the new design, but hate that I cannot fully trust it anymore, especially with templates (which used to be a big plus for v1.0). Specifically, on several occasions (and more than 1 template, it's not a settings fault) it will assign a random date to the event - for once, but not always, it seemed to be the date when the template was created?! Will update/upgrade stars when this is fixed.",good
I love this application so much. I can organize so much easier without having to pay. I love it.,good
Great accurate day date,good
"Great Calendar. Use this for work and personal business. Had everything I need and more. I use my calendar a TON for work, and this app makes planning easier for me.",good
The best,good
"Premium for dark mode? No thanks, I'll pass.",poor
"So you just put tasks in alphabetical order instead of the order in which I need to do them depending on the time there should be the capability to change that I do not want to read my tasks in alphabetical order I want to read them in the order that I placed them on my task list I'm uninstalling this app I don't know why I keep trying to use it, it never works well.",poor
"I subscribed for a year plan, and it's asking me to get a premium. I mean, I paid but can't use the premium feature, and its not even letting me log out! Trash bug.",poor
Worst app,poor
Very very very very very very bad or should I say the worst app I have ever seen. It doesn't let me sign in and even create account even if I agree every condition. I was so excited to try it after reading all the reviews but it is useless!!! 🙄🙄🙄🤬,poor
Too many bugs in 10 minutes of use to keep. I saw so many bugs just trying to get it setup that I immediately requested a refund. Tasks that showed up twice when checking them off. Recurring task that didn't recure. I was more than willing to pay $30 for a planner that worked and had the feature i need.. Unfortunately this one didnt.,poor
Not working on my lenovo tab2 and its crash my tablet system old ver . Work fine,poor
You are required to give access to your calendar and contacts and other bs. If I wanted to use Google calendar I would use Google calendar. I want something not linked to any of my other accounts.,poor
"I love the idea of this however when I log an all day event it goes over into the next day which makes it very annoying so I am unable to use. Please fix asap. Still not working, Please can you sort this because I want to be able to use it.",poor
very invasive into data collection,poor
You cannot change the default online calendar. This does me no good to only have multiple local calendars.,poor
"Never use this app, only a little bit!",poor
Got a new tablet which sync my notes fine after I uninstalled and signed back in. My new phone won't sync. On the app for my phone there is no place to sign out! Frustrating,poor
"Horrible product. Difficult to use, does not do half of what is shown. I even bought a pen for my tablet, but still is not any where as easy to use as advertised. Waste of money. I'd give it zero stars, but that is not an option.",poor
"Now hold on. I paid for the ""premium version"" a couple years ago for ad-free use. Decide to update the app for once and suddenly that's gone?",poor
Wont let me create an account,poor
Not a fan. I paid for the upgrade and it isn't working out for me. Maybe others will like it but I don't.,poor
Doesn't look like the pictures at all. Exact same layout as your phone's calendar. Now new settings etc. Waste of time app.,poor
I couldn't even make an account. It wont work,poor
I see no difference in this and Google calendar,poor
"Extremely Disappointed. I had been a faithful user of this app and loved it. Then all of sudden everything changed. There is no cloud support. The tabs option is gone. There is no interface with established tasks list. I have tried and tried to use. I contacted support and they replied that due to streamlining the app it has a completely new appearance. I had uninstalled this app, however I felt I needed to write thos review. After I finish this, uninstalling this app. Useless to me.",poor
Cannot get it to work on my Huawei P20. I have tried 3 times and cannot get it to sign in. It looks like it works fine on my iPad because I can sign up and get in but on my phone I am unable to do either. I needed something that I could use on both devices but am unable to get into in ob my phone,poor
"Too many ads, and it doesn't automatically save your work. Also, everytime I exit, and reopen it, it brings me to a different page than I was on.",poor
I was really excited about this app but when I went to create an account it did not work. I tried logging in with my google account but it still didn't work. I am very disappointed,poor
"Rollback, right after editing.. pls fix this!",poor
I can't get a refund and the app doesn't work. Google play is zero help and I can't reach a developer! I've been robbed.,poor
Lousy app,poor
I loaded the app on to my Amazon Fire. It will only display horizontally and I dont have the export option even though I have the Premium subscription. I can't export my Task list either.,poor
"In order to actually use the app as a planner, you have to pay money. Very misleading and dissapointing.",poor
"I use to love this app. It is the perfect organizer with great features. However for the last month+ it barely opens. I am lucky if it will actually open twice a day. The app will say not responding, opens to a black page, or doesn't do anything but freeze my phone momentarily. My life is saved into this app so I am so frustrated!!",poor
Would not let me create a log in.,poor
This app is not worth the $6 a year. Poorly developed with several glitches.,poor
1 star for obligatory signup using Google /fb/twitter.,poor
Doesn't work offline. requires internet and information. So not personal as it is over the internet. Sorry did not get past first screen requiring sign up... UNINSTALLED.,poor
I couldn't even log in,poor
"Nope,all i ever wanted was to keep track of my stuff durring winter break,and no im an eight year old,and i have to enter an email,please god no god save this app",poor
Can't sign in. And there are reviews from October saying the same. So... No improvement over months of having the same issue.,poor
"So disappointing!!! I used to love this app bit over the last few months it is Sooooooo glitchy! I just spent an hour deleting and checking off tasks from my to do list and everytime I think Im done, they show back up in triplicate!! Everything I changed IS STILL THERE AFTER AN HOUR!!! DOES THAT SOUND LIKE A GOOD TIME MANAGEMENT PROGRAM????? AND NO WAY TO CONTACT SUPPORT BECAUSE WHEN I TRY TO GET TO THE MENU IT SHOWS A BLACK SCREEN!!!!!",poor
Trash dont waste ur time unless u want to pay for the things that should b free,poor
I don't care for the dashboard,poor
Couldn't even create a log in.,poor
Piece of poo,poor
NOTE TO SELF::: The demo version of this app is totally useless - so there is no way of knowing if this product will be able to meet my needs BEFORE paying for the premium version. I'll find another way to get my needs met. I'm sure there are other products available for free that would do the same things. Since I'm not allowed to testdrive all the bells and whistles - I am passing this app over. No thanks. UNINSTALLING.,poor
Completed tasks continue to reappear,poor
"Lmao this app is so bad. Setting events is a pain, time zones don't work, the from time and to time of an event don't work. If you trust this app for your planning. I'm sure you'd go mad because of missing important meetings due to wrong time setting. Just use Microsoft Outlook etc and pay for it. This one is a waste of time",poor
It won't allow you to create an account with e-mail address and password. Why give you the option but then doesn't work when you use it. If not resolved within a week uninstalling app.,poor
Got a new phone and app now won't allow me to hit sign in button. Customer service is very slow to respond to help. Love the app for last 2 / 3 yrs but not being able to use now is not worth my $$$ paid for it & to think it just renewed,poor
Why does this basic app need access to my contacts and refuse to work without? Give me a break you filthy parasites.,poor
Closing and crashing when adding tasks and project. Support answering but doesn't help.,poor
Not as advertised,poor
Too complicated when putting on data. I'll stay with my diary.,poor
"Closes everytime I try to add a note, event or anything else since last update",poor
"This is just a re-skinned Samsung calendar, don't waste your time",poor
The app does not work after last nights update,poor
App has stopped opening,poor
"Suddenly not displaying all other calendars. And after reinstalling, app won't open.",poor
wouldnt let me make an regular account without linking something to it.,poor
well I just got it and attempted to.create an account and after unfilled out the info it would not submit it. what gives,poor
"could be better. pls fix the 'repeat' setting where i could accually pick the exact date and time. for example i have to study during mondays, tuesdays and fridays at 8 pm. the app isn't very specific about it deeming it useless to me. hoping for a better update.",poor
"over basic, definitely not worth 200 per year. pictures shown are not what the app looks like.",poor
"Was great at first, but a new bug makes it so that every time I unlock my phone i have to press the “home” button twice to be able to use my phone at all. I know that it is this app causing the problem as when I click on the recently used apps tab after the bug occurs, this app is always the only one shown. I will have to uninstall now because of this.",poor
the app opens it self up whenever it wants to display an ad but the screen remains the same but i cant press anything. so it just opens up in the background all day long to display ads and make money when im not even using the app. this feature is ridiculous and it started happening every 5 minutes as opposed to every now and then so i just deleted the app.,poor
"I have used this app for years. I have always paid for the premium version. At first, it was my favorite app, but it has gotten steadily worse. Now it is very glitchy. It closes randomly and typically takes up to three minutes to open which is very embarrassing when I'm trying to set an appointment with a customer. It also randomly unchecks completed tasks and reverts to older versions of my schedule. The developers are uncaring and blame my phone (Note 8). I'm looking for a new app.",poor
"Doesn't update changes live or correctly, even. Was a waste of money for some basic app.",poor
took $ before the renewal date. have not recieved my refund and canceled on the due date.,poor
"purchased the plus version and now with the update to pro, I no longer have my premium features.",poor
will not be using ever again.,poor
I cannot even create an account I fill in what's needed and I'm pressing the button and it's not working some1 help.,poor
"I loved this app, but until they get rid of the yearly charge after making us buy it to begin with I'll keep this at a 1. I did previously have this as 5 star, but I can't stand companies doing stuff like this.",poor
not great.....,poor
This is a great planner but I'm really annoyed that having previously paid for the Pro version I am now expected to pay an annual fee!!!,poor
"I liked this app, even paid for it, but uninstalled it today due to weird behavior. I see two other reviews here with a similar problem. The app will periodically launch itself, but it's just a black screen, and it creates a copy of my home screen - looks the same but frozen until I hit the close button, then the copy scrolls away and I can again use my phone. Just odd.",poor
"I have had this app for 2 years and absolutely loved it, after an update it would cut on automatically and freeze my phone. I would have to hit the open apps and close it before I could do anything with my phone. I have emailed and explained what it was doing, and I get am email wanting more explanation, so I did. several days later I get an email that wants a video showing. I don't think this will get fixed i paid for the pro version and i will not renew",poor
ANNOYED paid for this years ago PAID full version and used it and recommended it! Now I am asked to pay YEARLY to remove ads! what joke! I paid for full add free version already and there is nothing new to justify the yearly purchase...,poor
This app launches itself with an invisible overlay over my home screen. That is EXTREMELY suspect behavior and therefore uninstalling.,poor
",infoo",poor
I can't get new password. It sends message: email is not available.,poor
it's simple enough to set up a task or event..but not once has it reminded me as set to. so looking for one that will.,poor
"when opening a sub-task from any view, the sub-task window does not even show the main list/task it is from",poor
cant use if i dont allow permission for contacts? dumb,poor
"This app used to be great. Now it is garbage. A few months ago it started doubling a few tasks - no problem, I just delete the extras. Now I get 5 to 10 copies of every task I delete. It is worthless.   I can't forget the wait times to open the app, up to 8 minutes of staring at a black screen.   Oh, and the fact that in the past week or two it started giving me ads even though I have been using the paid version for years already.   I let them know a couple weeks ago and got no response.",poor
Cannot log in on other devices.,poor
I received a notice from planner pro this morning when I went to schedule some appts. it notifies me I cannot use the app until payment received. iI checked my bank and payment was made on 01/26/2019. I will be cancelling as unable to use.,poor
Won't even let me make a new account. Unusable.,poor
Can't get account created. Tried linking facebook and straight account creation... will not let me progress past sign in page.,poor
Could not get the app to save event time properly. All I wanted was to put a due date between 11:50 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. on a certain day. WOULD NOT do it. The app kept automatically changing my times. That's annoying enough for me to ditch it and move on.,poor
Amazingly useful app with horrible glitches every week when all checked tasks become undone and overdue and default calendar changed by itself.,poor
i hate it😠,poor
I thought upgrading and paying the $8 fee would allow me to use all of the functions of this app. It does not. I Haven't been able to sync any of my devices . Absolutely will not let me add an event. This was a waste of time and money. If I can't add my schedule on my lap top version then there's no point to this app. Plus there's no support or anyone to contact to help trouble shoot or credit me back .,poor
uninstalled once i realized there are ads and it wipes your current Google calendar.,poor
Shows annoying full screen ads that pop up from time to time!,poor
"uninstalled, it interferes with my normal Google calendar.",poor
Want use only not sharing,poor
This app deleted my whole google calender,poor
don't bother with this planner app. there are lots of other apps that do the same thing. this app has intrusive ads thats pop up at random. if you close the app and open a different app planner pro will open a pop up on the new app your using. seriously don't even bother with this BS,poor
Who puts ads on a calendar?! Y'all that desperate for money smh.,poor
Does not integrate well across multiple cross-platform devices; more upsetting to discover this after paying for the app.,poor
"This app sucks if you dont have the Pro version. I only had for a few min and couldn't do more than add a task. I tried to add an event, and wanted to sync chromebook to cell but it wouldn't let me.",poor
Infested with ads now. Downloaded to specifically view one calendar and set it so but it automatically syncs my Samsung and gmail calendars automatically every time I open it.,poor
"I lost all of my notes, and it wouldn't accept my passcode to get in any more so I deleted it and installed it again, then logged in and all of my stuff was gone. Please help, I need it back.",poor
App became unusable with 11/06/18 update. Now the app takes 30-45 to open up after I click it and then I'm get an annoying ad that plays that I can't close for another 5-10 seconds. I'll be finding a new calendar app.,poor
Please fixed it. Why i can't login my passcode. Damnly. Alot of doc i ve save inside,poor
"I have been using this for more than a year now, it was great, this is where i jot down notes on my classes and meetings, but this new update may have a bug i cant access it even with the correct pin i have entered Pls fix this issue, thanks",poor
Cannot access the app,poor
"I tried adding the pro for $7.99 because I thought you could set daily reminders by just marking repeat daily it doesn't do that or any of the things I was hoping for, I have had it less than 24 hours and would like a refund, I have sent emails asking for help and haven't received anything back so I just want my money back and this app gone!",poor
Will not accept passcode after today's update. Have been a paid user for some time and NEED my info back. Please fix and I will update my review. Useless to me until resolved.,poor
No,poor
It says you are downloading the pro version which is a complete lie.,poor
This basically is just a purple version of Google calendar. It has the almost exact same layout as Google calendar without any extra features. I wanted to use this as planner for school seperate from my calendar but there was no way to have it not sync with Google. Don't bother getting this app just use calendar directly.,poor
"I liked it at first, even paid for it too but now it won't sync across my devices so I need to find something else that will",poor
Absolutely terrible customer service. They refused after several years to fix the 9.7 tablet aspect ratio. For a paying customer this is absolutely poor customer service has never work properly once don't buy those that run away,poor
Could not even create a account,poor
"A negative experience.  I wasn't using it and forgot about it until it was renewing.  I didn't port it over to a new phone and it seems  you can't cancel the app except through the app.  This means I would have to install it on my new phone, give it permission to access my information, then cancel the subscription and uninstall it.  Other apps on my phone with subscriptions I can cancel through Google Play.  Apparently not this one.",poor
"Started my account with outlook and went to put it on my phone apparently 
forgot password so hit forgot password and it said I didn't have an account 
so I went back to my tablet and it told me the same thing. I even put a pin 
in my phone and the pin was right, but it had deleted everything all the 
same and told me again I didn't have an account after making another new 
one. This app would be great if it didn't delete everything all the time. I 
would have recommended it before all this happened but not any more",poor
"You are Nutzzz? I am not going to pay you Yearly for this. It is simply Not 
worth it.",poor
"I set up an account Set up tasks for the week Now it says my email and 
password are not on file. How do I correct this",poor
Wants you to buy full version for tasks,poor
You have to pay for reminders? Not worth it,poor
"Used the trial but it consistently asks for a pin to open it. I have no pin 
for it. I have installed and uninstalled it multiple times with the same 
result. If the free version doesn't work, I won't be spending money on a 
full version!",poor
Absolute trash. You can't do anything without paying 7.99 😑,poor
Dates are wrong!!,poor
"It was a bad app it was to challenging and it was so stupid. I would not 
recommend it to anyone. DONT GET IT IT SERIOUSLY SUCKS!!!!!!!",poor
"Why do they need my age? Uninstalled straight.... Who knows whatever data 
is being harvested",poor
"Don't bother unless you pay them($7.99yr) they don't offer a 
trial(suspicious) and you get NO access to features without paying. Too 
many other apps just like this that are much cheaper and let you TRY the 
pay version before paying.",poor
"I think this is more on the app store side. Shows download but never 
progresses past that. I have a new Note 8",poor
"I wanted a calendar app to keep track of business appointments separate 
from my personal appointments; however, this app automatically synced with 
my other calendar, combining all appointments. I have reached out to them 
for assistance but recieved no help. Very disappointed.",poor
"How do I contact you to get my passcode changed- can't get in!  Website not valid.  Please help.  The app looks like what I want to use but can't get in.  My bad, but need your help!",poor
"Requires too many permissions, suspicious. Also seems to be online only. Unacceptable.",poor
It does not work as the ad,poor
You shouldn't have to pay to get access for reoccurring events,poor
They've redone the layout and it's horrible,poor
Will not sync calendars,poor
I purchased the upgrade subscription and found no meaningful difference between the free application and the subscription application. I feel ripped off and immediately ask for the return of my money.,poor
"This used to be my go-to planner app but now it's so buggy. Always undoes my settings and turns back on 24 hour format (EDIT: A year later and this has only gotten WORSE! Where are the supposed bug fixes?) and doesn't push important task notifications I've set. I bought the pro version a while ago when it was a single payment purchase, but now apparently I no longer can use it and it's a yearly subscription. That wasn't a condition when I bought it and I would never have bought it if I'd known they'd convert to yearly subs. Not worth it.",poor
Can't set a daily reminder without paying.,poor
It charges you 5 dollars for the same thing Google provides,poor
I have used this app for a while but two days ago it lost much of my data and now closes every time I try to use it . I tried to reboot the device but to no avail . I tried to contact support to no avail .,poor
"I uninstalled immediately.  I am looking for a calendar that allows for me to have repeating tasks on the same day of every month.  This app does not do this.  It only repeats monthly, not on the same day of every month.  Then when you try to change the date for the task it doesn't populate correctly.  Very disappointing. Plus the only way to see if this feature was possible was to purchase a subscription.",poor
"All phones come with built in calendars. To use this app as anything more than a basic calendar you have to pay $5. I would not consider that a free app, as the only part that's free is the part you already have access to.",poor
You shouldn't have to have an account,poor
Can't create account.,poor
Not interested in any app that expects me to open an account before I can see anything associated within the app smh,poor
It doesn't work at all!!,poor
"I keep trying to edit the settings to be on 12 hour format and only include one of my accounts, but the settings keep going back to original settings.",poor
I set up a passcode and now it won't let me in. Can I bypass this? If I can't I will be asking for a refund.,poor
"Didn't work, I've tried this before and it's never worked, don't waste your time",poor
Not usable without purchasing,poor
I chose the password route then they kicked me out my own account. I hate Google play services.,poor
I purchsed it in order to use projects and subtasks.  Disappointed to see its just tasks under projects and doesnt really have subtasis at all.  How do I cancel my subscription?,poor
"In short, the app is just like a phone calendar. I dont see the point in installing an app on my phone that my phone already came with. Would be better if the days we boxed or lengthy sections",poor
Dont waist your money or time with this app.,poor
Im not paying for it. I dont care how good it is,poor
Looked good until I used it,poor
Why should I have to sign up for a calendar app!? And why does it need my contacts info? I don't trust apps like this one! there are plenty of great free apps that don't require sign up. I am uninstalling. I recommend Time tune instead...,poor
"This is absolutely worthless. Actually, it's probably awesome, but only if you pay for the full version! Seriously? Great marketing, y'all. Imply that you get everything for free then come to find out you even have to pay for recurring events! How ridiculous is that? Right. Not that it's that expensive, but one it's a yearly payment, and two, who's going to pay for anything they aren't sure will work just right? Not me...   Developers, I'm being extra generous and giving you two stars, because it's a good app behind the payment and it's only $5 a year. But for real? Recurring events? I should not have to pay for that. And don't advertise projects or anything  else  we are forced to pay for with free features.",poor
Used this app one day and it wouldn't accept my pin to get in. I e-mailed support and never heard a word from them. The app itself seemed decent but support is horrible.,poor
You can't even look at your schedule in the weekly view without paying their $5/yr subscription. Trash.,poor
I downloaded this planner app for a secondary use. It completely wiped out everything in my phone calendar which is primary!,poor
There's no point in downloading this app as it just repeats what any basic calendar app does.,poor
I hate the lay out. It's really confusing.,poor
Requires access to my contacts. Not cool.,poor
"Installed on Galaxy S8 phone. Can't get the app to unlock. Screen requires PIN #. I don't recall setting up a PIN#. None of the PIN#'s I use can open the app. I've tried uninstall + reboot + reinstall the app, but ""no joy""; still stuck at the same ""Enter Your Passcode"" screen. Appxy Tech Support seems unable to solve the problem.",poor
Logged out. Could not log back in. Tried a password reset got invalid email. Tried to recreate account got email already exists.,poor
I don't like this app because once you sign up you can't delete your account! It sucks! The support team won't respond to me and it's been an hour now. I would not recommend this app to anyone. Don't waste your time.,poor
Won't  sync,poor
"The description of this app says it supports tasks - but doesn't tell you it only works in the paid version.  Tasks are the ONLY reason I downloaded, and I will not pay for an app when I can't try out a feature, first.  I feel like this developer has stolen my contact information now - very shady. Will not use this or any of their other apps.  Uninstalling, with a vengeance.  Going back to Google calendar and Google Keep, and will continue to look for an app that works like those two google apps in an integrated single app...or works similar tor Microsoft Outlook.",poor
Since the last update the app won't load. I've lost all my notes and homework for my class 😭 please fix and I will change my review. I usually love this app 😤,poor
Won't sync as promised. Did when I first loaded it but not now. No good if it doesnt,poor
How do I cancel the yearly subscription?,poor
Free to download. Not free to schedule projects. Might as well write things down on notebook paper.,poor
Butty,poor
"I had pretty high hopes for this app, but the Passcode feature doesn't work. You set the passcode, close the app. The next time you log in, with the passcode, you get an error stating your password has been changed. You then have to sign in with your actual password. If you close the app again, you get asked for your passcode --NOT your passWORD. But your passcode doesn't work anymore, that time. So you get locked out and have to uninstall the app entirely just to get back into it. The passcode option is useless. IDK how I feel about the rest of the features.",poor
After paying the $5 I decided I didn't like it and canceled.... No refunds....rip off!!!,poor
No reason to have to register before you can use it!  Don't like my info to spread online for privacy reason's. So bc you make people register is why i Uninstalled app,poor
Sucks... Within 1 minute... Ugh,poor
This app is worthless if you don't buy full version. I don't recommend downloading it!,poor
It's a shame that you have a create a profile or give any of your social media account in order to log in.,poor
I can't do the setting thingy,poor
It seems like it just a regular calander unless you pay for the full version.,poor
Won't let me even test the features of the program without the hassle of creating a full account. Uninstalled.,poor
Pathetic app. The date does not change at 12am but it changes at 12pm and the developer doesn't even care to solve the issue. Worst app which doesn't even serve its purpose.,poor
To use this app fully the want you to pay. There are many that don't so why waste money,poor
"WHY DO I NEED TO CREATE AN ACCOUNT?!  I already downloaded the damn thing, so why does it require an account sign in?  UNINSTALLED.",poor
Can't do recurring tasks without paying for it. The calendar my phone came with can do more then this one.,poor
Sucks only does what calender does.  Don't need it.,poor
Had this horrible app for about 3 minutes and deleted it.,poor
I like the interface a ton more than the Google calendar and I would use it of it didn't have so many bugs with sharing calendars. It worked briefly and then stopped. By the end my events disappeared. My settings were all right but it just didn't work for me. I need a calendar that I can edit with my employer. The help email couldn't help and stopped responding. Uninstalled. Too bad I already bought the computer app.,poor
I haven't used this app or been charged in over a year!!! Now you guys charged me!? PUT MY MONEY BACK ON THE CARD NOW OR I WILL REPORT YOU TO GOOGLE!,poor
"If you don't allow access to the contacts you can't use the app. REALLY??? NO app, I repeat NO APP needs access to contacts to run. My contacts are private and none of your business. I've denied access on every single app that asks for it and they all run fine. You apparently are too persistent for reasons I can't see... uninstalled on the spot. Let me know when you reconsider your requirements.",poor
The fact that it forces landscape view is completely absurd.,poor
"You must grant permission to access calendars for Google account already on the phone, or it won't work. If I wanted to use that calendar, why would I download this app? Also, for week view, you have to pay $4.99/year? That's outrageous. I'd consider a one-time payment of $4.99, but that's a bit too steep, as well.",poor
Planner Pro annual subscriber. App has stopped working. Force closes on any action using widget.,poor
No at all free. Should be in payed app section.,poor
It is so dumb it starts off with the wrong month and you can do barley anything on it,poor
With in 2 minutes the Pascoe locked me out then didn't recognize my email. Not bothering to email since I didn't even get a chance to try it yet.,poor
It was terrible. I couldn't even sign up. It keeps glitching!😒,poor
This app changed the password I had and I don't know what it is what do I do?,poor
"The app glitches a lot. It's the oddest thing, I will be setting an important appointment time for a day in June, but it will randomly place my appointment in September. I was trying to figure out what day of the week an event want going to be on, and I was looking at the September 2017 page but it was showing me dates for October 2017 even though it said ""September"" at the top. This has happened multiple times and I've missed 2 appointments in the past momth because my dates were not saved in the correct spot or not at all.   I do not reccomed this app even if you're desprate.",poor
Make it free,poor
I lost all my records because these people quit supporting their app and are impossible to get ahold. It does not sync like it's supposed to so if you get a new device every record you ever put on this app is gone period!,poor
"Paid for this app, really thinking there would be more user control and options. Much better apps for free , friends!",poor
I paid for the premium so I can get things repeated weekly. I tried to put something in to be repeated every week on Tuesday. It only repeated one week thats it. So I have to put it in manually for every tue. There should be a way to type in once and then set a repeat so it will auto show every Tuesday. I feel like I wasted my money now. I set repeat to every 7 days it does not work.,poor
I WOULD say this is nice but you need your email adress and I gave my correct one but it said please enter a valid email adress. This is nice and i am not cursing but please remove the fact that we have to place our email adress😕. I know this is not my app or game but im just giving a suggestion. TQ.,poor
Used the pro version for a couple months as it seemed like a good app. Randomly deletes and duplicates events and unable to customise when events are recurring. If they aren't one day after another you have to manually enter them all. Uninstalled.,poor
They are always changing Something after updates. And it isn't always functional like used to be,poor
The widget stops working way to much.,poor
"It makes auto-copies of tasks. When you delete them, keep showing them again and again. Very annoying.",poor
"This new planner pro for which I paid for life is poorer than the previous version. I take ages to open, does not immediatly delete bring not all old tasks forward. Very bad.",poor
"I downloaded this app on my photo and it works great! But I just downloaded on my tablet for school and even though I used the same account, none of my events were there. It didnt sync right. I tried to restart, nothing. This app is good, just not for multiple devices.",poor
"This app was fine for years and then became extremely laggy. It also started duplicating weekly tasks to the point that I would have to delete five or six versions of a task in order to return it to one weekly. Often the delete or complete options have to be used multiple times on the same task before it actually disappears. I have basically stopped using it except as a calendar, but it's so slow it's not even efficient to be used for that.",poor
"Great app But it forces you to sign in to something to use it, which is garbage. You should be able to use this without signing in. Backup and restore doesn't have to be via online accounts only, it can be ""export to file"" thing, which I preffer 100% of the time.",poor
Nice looking app albeit does not seem to sync with Google calendar and not cross platform. Certainly cannot do $15/yr.,poor
"suddenly with ads and paid content disappeared, synchronization has some issues",poor
"It's useful but it doesn't fully sync the events, tasks, and notes between devices. It's a huge inconvenience. Besides that I still love the app.",poor
This is literally just another calendar app. Misleading calling it a planner. Smh. It's not even a good calendar. If you're hunting for a good planning app keep looking because this is definitely not it!!!,poor
It's Google calendar with different color scheme,poor
"Ver y often the application does not open, you sen question and ask what is happening, and you get No replied,, Roger J Sanchez from Miami",poor
Loved this app until I updated updated it. Gibberish on every day now. It is terrible. Like this on my phone and tablet!!!!! How do I fix. I depend on this planner!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,poor
"Not very intuitive. I couldn't find a way to switch between week, day, or month views.",poor
notifications stopped working then it deleted all my tasks,poor
"It is doing a strange black screen thing, and randomly opens by itself (other reviews have mentioned this) and I suspect it is making my phone crash. My phone is crashing several times a day, when I remove the app it stops crashing. I hope there is a fix for this. It works just fine on my tablet, but not my phone. It's a great app due to its simplicity. I switched to another planner app today and will be requesting a refund.",poor
it used to be a good app until they added the latest update which includes ridiculously annoying ads and frequent crashes.,poor
Please fix the widget. It doesn't automatically update the day. It always shows yesterdays' date. Constantly having to remove and install widget.,poor
i think I could really like this app. except I upgraded to paid and still have ads and the search function does not search notes. It will be hard to find info saved in notes if you cant search...,poor
"DO NOT PAY FOR UPGRADE!! If you upgrade it just messes the app up. I have to manually change days every morning now. If it weren't for that, it'd be great. Please fix.",poor
I was told to install Planner Pro instead of Planner Plus (which was what I already used) in order for my cell phone & iPad to sync. I have had at least 5 emails back & forth with the contact person but I still can't get my calendars linked using my email address as instructed. I guess I will have to go back to my Google calendar. I love the Planner Plus but need a calendar that syncs to both my cell and iPad.,poor
"Eh. it's mediocre and really doesn't do anything your calendar app on your phone doesn't already do. I liked using the month widget until it just decided, on Jan 29, that the month of February no loger existed. I tried to look ahead to the month of Feb to see a preview from the widget but it kept going fron Jan to March. The only way to view Feb in the widget was to change the date to Feb in my phone. just went back to my phone's calendar app. Uninstalling.",poor
after reinstall data not recover while take backup Google Drive,poor
"The interface is great and I love it overall; however, I'm giving it two Stars because it won't synchronize between my Samsung phone and Ipad, despite being the same account information for each. I emailed their support like about this, and they asked for my login info, but I never heard anything back. This is a huge inconvenience because I put a LOT into the version on my iPad, and I dont, and wont, do it twice for the same application. Once this is fixed I'll happily increase the rating.",poor
I would love it if my calendar would sync across by devices. And my tasks & notes synced. Its disappointing because I enjoy the simplicity of the format; its user friendly. But iy doesn't work for me since I can't sync all devices.,poor
"I loved this planner for several years with no issues. All of a sudden I can't launch the app or create/edit an event without getting a noisy, intrusive pop-up ads. I will be looking for a new option, possibly even just my stock calendar.",poor
"I have been using this for a while and found it to suit my needs well. I wanted something where I could see trasks and appointments in a daily view. This accomplished that goal in an easy to read and navigate format. However, there must have been a recent update that has made the ads ridiculously invasive to the point that I no longer want to use this app. I think I will start checking on alternate options.",poor
"Free Version does not allow you to view all your events in the monthly view. I only see colored dots that indicate an event is scheduled. I would like to see the event names. I contacted support, but sadly did not get a response.",poor
Pain. Ya have to create an account to access,poor
It sucks🖕🖕,poor
"This app sucks its slow and they make you pay to make checklists which is 
ridiculous",poor
"I've had this app for a few years, and it worked well until the last several months - it's gotten increasingly buggy and will do things like ""forget"" you checked off tasks as completed and re-list them as incomplete between closing and re-opening the app.  It also had been freezing more and more frequently, to the point where that happens at least once a day, and now I can't even load certain screens.  Because of this, I will not be renewing my subscription this year and will be using another app.",poor
"Not what I was looking for, I saw there was a time it would remind me I 
thought it would work but non of them did so that sucked",poor
"Loved it...until the projects feature was going to cost me a yearly fee. 
Honestly, I wanted to try it and see if it works for me so you lost me when 
you made the features I wanted cost.",poor
"Won't let me use/access weekly view unless I pay $7.99 for the year. What a 
crock. I'll find another app 👋",poor
"I paid for the subscription but can not use the recurring function. I tried 
to make a task for monthly use and it does not show up on the other months 
ahead.",poor
"This app was AMAZING when I first started using it. Now it duplicates tasks 
too much. I have about 20 of the same task for each day and it takes 
forever for me to delete the extra tasks.",poor
"I made several repeating tasks that are supposed to be repeated weekly by the day of the week. They seem to just multiply and now the same 4 tasks will show up 3 times each on a single day. I can't edit the original repeating ones, I can only delete them individually on the day they show up several times. This is VERY annoying. This app was a waste of my money. I paid for the ability to make repeating tasks. I'm very disappointed.",poor
"Was fine until the last couple of days when the layout turned squirrelly on my Android tablet.  Seems okay on my smart phone.  Still, I will not purchase full version unless the version for my tablet goes back to matching the screen layout on my cell.",poor
"Uninstalled when I saw the app wanted me to pay a subscription fee as ransom for my data, I never will.",poor
I set weekly view in settings and for few days the app worked fine but today i tried to go back to months view and i tried to access settings but when i try to do that the app closes,poor
I just installed this app and it's always on landscape view. Please fix this soon. Thank you!,poor
It's just a skin for Google calendar.,poor
When my phone is in tablet mode (android 7) the app will not display in portrait mode. It defaults to landscape mode.  Pls fix and I'll change my review.,poor
It's ok. The free version does the same thing your calender does on  your phone.,poor
"With so many free calendar apps out there, there's just nothing in the free version of this one to make you choose it. The only feature that might set it apart from the competition is the project feature, but you have to pay to use it. Sure, you have the notes feature, but there are ways to accomplish the same thing in pretty much any other calendar, so I just can't see the point. Rather than pay for an upgrade to an app that's just ho-hum (the view isn't even very customizable), I'll be uninstalling.",poor
"I don't want make an account before trying out the app! Give us a week trial before making us sign up, please.",poor
Would like questions answered I email my questions for answers & I give my contact info for almost two months now but no one contacts me. This is very disappointing especially when I bought this app. Very poor for business kevin,poor
I have questions that i would like to have answered and i have emailed numerous times with no reponse back. They say dont write negative reponses to this app without contacting us first. I did email for answers but no one will answer my questions. My questions are not bad for this app but the people behind this app are terrible business people. So this could be a great app but service is terrible. Which instead of getting 4 or 5 stars im giving 2 should be 1 but app is good the ones behind the app are bad just want to take peoples money and then laugh at us by not helping,poor
Didn't get past not being able to use it in portrait mode.  I think I should be able to choose whether I need widespread view as in a spreadsheet or a portrait view to view a page of writing and this does not give me the option. I may end up using it this is only the second app that I have tried for organizing by used to be hand & ink written notebooks.,poor
Ads. Just too many.,poor
"I really wanted to like this app, but it's just too buggy. Sometimes I open the app and it doesn't have the icons to switch views. Also the 12-hour formatting is really flawed. And the priority scale seems way too complex. High, medium, low should be enough for most people.",poor
"This app is a pretty good one, but on my Galaxy Note, it stopped allowing me to check off tasks for some reason.  I paid for the pro version before this happened unfortunately.",poor
"i ws kinda disappointed because i really loved the user interface of the app and how smooth it flows from one set up to another. however, i have to uninstall and install it back up several time because it will not accept the 4digit password i have set it up with. i had to do it like 10 times :/ but still like the app tho. i hope that bug will be fixed sooner.",poor
UI atrocious! Nothing fits.,poor
"App is very buggy ! Week view is completely unusable - shows some events twice, and some not at all.  Also, it would be nice if there was an option, in month view, to see the names of the events without having to click on every day individually.  Fix this and you'll get 5 stars, but without that (especially week view!) the app is useless.",poor
Isn't Thanksgiving and Christmas considered a holiday??? Am I wrong???,poor
"Widget is buggy - a task marked as completed in the app is displayed as overdue, and trying to tick it off in the widget takes me into edit mode. The proper app, when reopened, shows a blank inbox and revisiting the screen is required to populate it again. Poor punctuation (eg. ""28 Sep , 2017” - why the space before the comma) is not that big a deal, but also adds to the app not feeling very ""pro"".",poor
"I like the app, but for the past day I haven't got any notifications.",poor
This app is not good if you don't buy the subscription.,poor
The app worked fine for awhile but all the events I added were simply gone this morning. This was a frustrating experience.,poor
I got locked out of my planner. After entering my paascode the app said that the passcode was wrong. It was not wrong. I suspected a system glitch and contacted the developer on June 17th of this year. I haven't received any response yet. I found my way around this problem by this time. I will not renew my subscription anymore. I will look for another app developer with a better customer service.,poor
Why this  require this much personal details?,poor
i cant set my times for events bc theres no am/pm option. it keeps changing my time not allowing me to put the right thing..annoying,poor
I paid for the pro version because the color coding in the free version didn't work properly. Come to find out that the pro version doesn't have daily tabs for tasks and notes as the free version does. But the paid version does color code. Gaining that feature isn't worth losing the other two. I feel robbed.,poor
It wouldn't let me in,poor
"Doesn't sync reliably, and that's one of the most critical features for a calendar app.",poor
"It was decent at first, but it stops working completely when I wanted to put a custom time reminder, and it did not sync with my Google calendar. I ended up deleting it :/",poor
"This app is not free for even a trial, so how am I going to buy it.",poor
I do not use it so I want to cancel the subscription but am unable. Jorte had unsubscribe within opening page. Unable to sign in.,poor
Passcode feature is messed up and locked me out. Had to uninstall. Yr,poor
"I tried to explore it a little after downloading, I want something that will show me everything planned on the day I have notes on rather than me having to search if I do, i tend to forget due to busy schedules. I want automatic pop up, I'll keep playing with it, but so far dislike",poor
"The single FranklinCovey planner feature available is the Task ABC123 priorities system, but oddly the Task status system is missing. No more FC system functionality. As of the rest it's a very conventional PIM suite with a little of CRM salt & pepper.",poor
"Well, based on the description of this app and what I understood I would receive has not, lived up to its description. I hope the bugs will be worked out. I emailed for help more than 24 hours ago and have not received any response thus far.  It would be helpful to have a help and/or FAQ section to refer to. After only one day of using the app, I have encountered the following:  1. From calendar screen, + button does not give option for Project (only Event, Task, or Note).  I have the upgraded version.  2. Settings, General, Start with... is set for Day View, but shows month instead.  3. Help & Feedback only gives option to email for help. No option to search for help.  4. When deleting an item in a series comma I do not get the option to just delete the one occurrence.  Am I doing something wrong? Is there any help that I can expect to receive? I paid $4.99 for the upgraded version, and I am not at all happy. Busy people with crazy schedules need a reliable app.",poor
"I think the free version of the app has some good capabilities, but lacks some functionality that I desire; functionality that I'm not sure exists in the paid version due to the lack of support for the product. I was unable to find where I could go to ask questions. Thus the 2 star rating",poor
It doesn't work well as a calander or any type of memo for me. I also didn't like the type of layout design they made it didn't fit with what the purpose of this app was said to do,poor
"Used to love this app, but after the update it's dumb and no longer useful.",poor
The app does not sync with my Google calendar and there is no sync option or refresh option. Meetings etc are not shown and I have to go back to the Google calendar or acalender to make sure I don't miss anything. Events made on my tablet do not show on my phone. Please fix this. It's such a great app if it just worked.,poor
It would be a 5* review if it weren't yearly payment. Put it a one time payment and I'll be the first one to buy it. This really ruined it for me.,poor
Free app is crippled version of paid app costs $4.99 a year.,poor
If you want to start a project you have to pay 4.99 a year.,poor
"I try signing up, logging in, even with Facebook and still won't even let me in",poor
Unable to create an account despite using email or social media account. Can't even start trying out the app,poor
This thing is terrible I couldn't do anything I wanted,poor
You want me to pay $5 for the full version so I can set a task to repeat? My phone's planner does that for free.,poor
It has deleted all of my entries planned for today. I am going to try a new app.,poor
Task notifications have stopped working.,poor
Its still asking me in an ad on the app to upgrade.  Not cool!,poor
"ট্যাবে হরাইজন্টাল, ফোনে ভার্টিকাল। ফলে ট্যাবে লিখতে অসুবিধা হচ্ছে। এবং লগ ইন করতে হয় যেকোন অ্যাকাউন্টে।",poor
Wish I can repeat sirten things without spending  money every year,poor
"I installed because of the option to synch tasks, but that is one of the features that unlocks for $4.99/yr. No issues paying it if I liked the feature, but with no chance to try out the one reason I download the app, I uninstalled immediately.",poor
"Very easy to pull me in I should have stopped, but hindsight is always 20/20. My friends and people who are interested in Google Apps for integrated coordination of tasks, meetings, whatever, but what really gets my blood boiling and made me downgraded from 3 stars to 2 Stars is the deadweight loss of not being able to either donate the rest of the subscription Source Capital investment that is just raining still if someone makes to make a donation. Is that I'm still sitting here with this deadweight loss.",poor
Its okay,poor
Doesn't sync with Google calendar. The one thing it's supposed to do and it failed.,poor
"Used to be good until last update, now I can't login to see any of my tasks, appointments, or notes.                                            Edit: Now works since newest update, but I have lost all previous tasks and notes. Very disappointed.",poor
Need full version for anything more than a calender,poor
What happened to all those data i had.. not able to log also,poor
Have used app for about 4 months now I can't get back into it. Keeps asking to sign in or create account won't let me do either. Time to dump it!,poor
Was a great app...but could not login..since last month so...bye bye planner pro,poor
"It was working ok for a couple of months, then would not let me sign in.    Funny thing is I don't remember signing out!  I would simply hit the icon on my android and it would just be there.  Sure looks like it works for others.",poor
"This app was everything I needed, I loved it. But after thenlast update I cannot log in to my account so I cannot see my daily schedule. Will not trust it again and I have already unistalled it. I need an organizing app which I can trust. Fortunately all the events were synced to my google calendar but notes and tasks didnt.. So I dont know if I am forgeting something that is pending now.",poor
"I logged in with Facebook. I upgraded to the pro version. Checked the planner a day later and had to log in again. Now it says to upgrade to the pro version again and if I click it, Play says I'm already subscribed to it.",poor
"Every time the company upgrades the app or make any changes, subscribers can't access the calendar. Sign in page has many issues.",poor
I put an event in and it doubles everyday. Fix the glitches this is a great app otherwise.,poor
At first I really liked it because all the systems are functioning well in my phone.. but when I used this in the tab... the notifications wont even turn !! I  sm really pissed by this and I hope you fix this ASAP,poor
Would not load,poor
Keeps telling me my email is invalid when it's a normal Gmail.. Won't let me sign up,poor
I went on thinking it was easy to put in reminders and stuff but it isn't.You have to buy the full version,poor
"It was great before, but lately it sends notifications whenever it likes. It doesn't notify according to schedule anymore. And now, it doesn't notify at all.",poor
"The free version comes with ads, and normally I would be okay with that except that it decides to interrupt you seemingly every minute to ""buy the full version now."" When planning your day, you might have to schedule time to exit out of the constant ad pop-ups.",poor
Doesn't go to portrait,poor
"I really did not like the fact that when I set an exact time for stuff, I can not sort to according to that, so If i want to plan my day, 10 am i have to do a, 11 am i have to do b, i can not sort it by time",poor
When opening this app on my tablet (Nexus 7 2013) my screen goes to landscape.  Upon exiting the app the screen remains stuck in landscape.  Only way to fix is to turn tablet off and back on.,poor
I love it,poor
Has potential but you gotta pay,poor
"I was pretty pleased with the layout and the weekly view on the paid version, but then I started encountering problems. First of all, I used fb to sign up and I logged out of the app, and I can no longer sign in. It stays loading indefinitely. Also, on the weekly view it showed the incorrect name for the day and kept changing it. It also changed notifications randomly.",poor
Paid for the pro version and itbdoesn't seem to be working properly.  Appointments are not showing and sometimes double books. Contacted support. Took several days to get back to me and was still not helpful. App is glitchy. Will not be renewing the subscription and going back to the old pencil and paper appointment tracking method.  I cannot run my business with a faulty appointment app. Very disappointing.,poor
"It was perfect for a personal planner.  Problem is I use Google calender widget for business and this widget for personal...what ever you select for one, automatically sets for the other.  Was kinda hoping for two different planners here.",poor
"Norton Antivirus reported this as a malicious App, and recommended I uninstall. After paying for the pro version I felt it was very lacking. No portrait mode on tablet, no day mode on phone, no way to adjust the length of a meeting beyond that of the default meeting settings.",poor
$5 for daily recurring tasks? No thanks,poor
It wouldnt sign me in at all and when I tryed to create an account it just stopped,poor
I'm not going to create an account so uninstalled. My tasks are private.,poor
"This app worked well at first, but it kept altering my entries no matter how many times I changed them. Not sure if it's a problem just with syncing accounts.",poor
"The UI is not attractive, to begin with. Text overlap and the fact that the only screen orientation available is landscape immediately turned me off to the app. The layout is not bad and puts all the information right in front of you but it looks as if it was built for Windows 98. I certainly was not willing to pay for the full version when the free version was so flawed. I can find better free apps with more functionality than the paid version of this one. It needs some work.",poor
I already had bought the full version and now I have to pay again which is whatever. But furthermore my calendar is missing most of the appointments and recurring events that I had before. I just upgraded my phone to the htc10 from the lg g5 and I have none of my important calendar events now.,poor
Suddenly need a subscription?  After I had paid for a full version?  And some of my calendars no longer work with the app??  Not impressed.,poor
"I dont see the difference between this and google calender, which already came with my phone.",poor
I found this difficult to use due to navigation. Love the home screen but its impossible to get back to it. Also the nonstop full screen ad to buy the app yearly is so annoying that alone makes it unusable. If you make my free experience terrible why would I want to pay you???,poor
"It's supposed to be able to go on multiple devices yet, when I downloaded to my phone after putting it on my tablet it just keeps saying loading. After I spent a lot of time setting it up and plugging in all my appointments for the next month it's a huge disapointment. Should I get fixed I will change rating to a 5-star",poor
"It does not give me the ability to NOT use 24-hr time format. I'm not in the military or a factory so I prefer regular time format. Doesn't matter how many times I uncheck the 24-hr setting, it sticks. Fix that and I'll rate higher and maybe even purchase a yr subscription.",poor
Wouldn't let me make reoccurring events without an upgrade.,poor
I liked the lay-out for the most part (except being forced into landscape mode in the app). The glitch was that when adding something to the calendar a box would come up for date/time but cut off the calendar and clock that's necessary to select date/time. There was no way to even input manually. It would work great if you only had to enter something for whichever date you were on and a specific one hour period set a half an hour after the time on your device. Very disappointing.,poor
"I did my update and EVERYTHING I had programmed and saved on this app is gone!!!!!!! I've lost all important dates, information and reminders for the entire year!!!. Well done guys!!!",poor
This app wouldn't up date my schedule. Only some postings would transfer to my employees phones and i couldn't be positive something actually worked unless I checked to make sure twice. I even bought the pro version. Not happy.,poor
I did like it until you updated and took the good features away. Lame!!,poor
On the pictures it shows you things that are only on the paid version.,poor
I liked the version before the update where it had blocks to show the event. That's the only reason why I downloaded it and now it got rid of it.,poor
Changes and cancellations do not get updated on the widget. Secondly it is not possible to scroll between months  easily,poor
"It just says ""it failed"" or something like that. Might work for you though",poor
It wasn't everything I thought it would be,poor
"I loved this app when I tried the free version, the side tabs and all. It felt like a planner. Then I open it up and it must've updated because the looks changed, no side tabs. So I paid for the pro version to get more out of it. Nothing has changes, I go to landscape view and it won't scroll. It's glitch to. I have paid the $4.99 and it keeps telling me to upgrade. I've already paid!!! I emailed you guys and still haven't heard any support a week later. So my advice to you all, keep your $5.",poor
I Was happy with all the things with this app UNTIL I got up to find all my appointments were GONE.,poor
"It's buggy when going back and forth between different views  (switching from events to tasks, etc) also tasks widget doesn't work because it will show ALL tasks... Completed tasks also included. I'd try to check the box to mark it complete,but it would bring me to edit the task. Monthly widget can't even be placed on my screen, it says there is not enough room (its a new slate I'm trying to put it on)",poor
The app always stops. I had to restart my tab to make it work or try to open so many times.,poor
"Seems to be extremely buggy. Couldn't work out how to use the app for what I wanted, so I subscribed for more features that I would use. App keeps telling me to purchase but then errors saying I'm already subscribed. Complicated and broken. If app updates then so will this review. Side note - portrait view for tablet would be very appreciated. Tablet is only 7 inches and portrait is easier to type on whilst standing at work.",poor
It was awesome the first week.  Now unless I upgrade and pay it locks up and constant request to pay for upgrade. Not free,poor
"I could not set the time to cover more than an hour difference between start and finish. And if I change the finish time, it would reset the start time to what I changed the finish time to.",poor
Don't like how it automatically syncs with Gmail and calender,poor
Please can l use this for my boss appointment s?,poor
Screenshots clearly show a weekly view but this isn't available unless you buy the full version for £3.49,poor
"Good looking app but got on the company's website to see what other integrations/platform downloads were available. No downloads available on their site, site is very sparse and lacking real support info. Get on their Facebook and see copious complaints about everything from people being double billed to glitches on various apps they've created. The clencher for me was that they were blatantly ignoring these comments and replies and continued posting links about their apps. Nope. Uninstalling.",poor
"Has some unchangeable unfeatures like not showing appointments marked with other than ""default"" privacy, as well as appointments marked as ""available"" - instead of ""busy"". That's all work hours I have set apart for clients but not allocated yet - important information to me.",poor
"Very good design, but will not sync across phone, tablet, Windows nicely. If they fix it I would like to go back.",poor
There are lots better calendar/task tracking apps out there.  Calengoo to name just one.,poor
"First, there is no dark theme. Second, there is no portrait mode for tablets.",poor
Would be great but this app has 31 days in February this year. It throws off everything for the rest of the year.,poor
Task sync with google calendar not working,poor
"All my tasks, except current day disappeared.  Still available on Google Calendar fortunately.",poor
Pop up reminder not showing for scheduled events,poor
I like to look at this at the start but then it wouldn't even show the correct date when you open up in the morning,poor
"I really have loved this app but it has lately been bugging out on me, even though it is up to date. It won't let me view certain days at all, it will just take me to the day before or the same date in a different month if I try clicking on it. It only started for the past week or two.",poor
No way to jump ahead in month view.  If you need to enter an event that's two months out it's a pain to do.  I uninstalled it.,poor
"will not allow me to click on certain dates, if I click on June 18, it only goes to June 17.",poor
"Pretty but hollow. No Google tasks integration so why bother. Widgets, like most other apps are too simple to be useful. Need to be able to control widget row height, text sizes and content.",poor
"I'm using a tablet where it's only available in landscape orientation. Just not for me, I think.",poor
"This app has issues with keeping my events and tasks saved.  Also, the widget does not update on a daily basis.  If it worked like it should, then this app would be amazing because the overall appearance of it is quite good.  Unfortunately, there isn't much use in having a planner that doesn't save your information properly.",poor
I would like to tap on the times I want to do something. As oppose to going through the new event button.,poor
It only notifies you once or twice then it doesnt notify you again,poor
On some point stopped showing calendar items. Waste of time.,poor
Guess it doesn't sync tasks from Google calendar.,poor
I've just downloaded this and I can't figure out how to set the same tasks to reaccre every day without having to type it in over and over.  Is there a way to do this? If so can someone help me plz?,poor
Idk it is kk,poor
When I put any task in a certain day it says that planner stopped and not working,poor
Didn't work well on my devise. Probably because it's an android😕,poor
"I installed the app because it had all the features I used in my paper planner. Once I installed the app and began using the widget calendar, the numbers and saved  events disappeared when I powered my Note 4 off and turned it back on.",poor
no reminders notifications,poor
Bought full version then got a refund....  It won't sync,poor
"I love this app, but the widgets aren't working at all. I'm stuck on yesterday, and neither the month nor the day widget arrows work. Please fix! It's really frustrating and troublesome since I rely on planner a lot.",poor
I felt really disappointed to find it did not look as shown. The week view is only available in the paid version.,poor
"Have to pay for the upgrade and everything is unclear. Feel like it wasn't as simple as it should of been. Need to change the app, make it better please!",poor
Need to pay for such feature . Else should be perfect for a planner usage.,poor
It looked decent app but uses CPU too much makes phone run hot even with Android 5.11,poor
Basic,poor
"Looks like a nice app but I immediately went to do my settings, the latest your day can end is midnight.... I work at night and my day ends at 5am... can't use this app if I can't program all my stuff :(",poor
Keeps crashing every time I try to use it,poor
Good app need to be able to synch with Google Calendar,poor
"This has many of the same features of the schedule app I already use, but is missing some key features. I see the paid version will allow me to repeat tasks but will it allow me to make drag and drop adjustments to my schedule. If so, then it would be worth the investment and a better review.",poor
Everytime I try to open an event it stops and closes out,poor
"It is a great app, but I am deleting it because it keeps resetting my clock preference, it keeps adding the email accounts I keep telling it not to, and it hardly ever notifies me when it's supposed to.",poor
Can't sync with google calendar,poor
"I loved it until I realized that the very feature that got me to download it in the first place, is only available in the upgraded version. I agree that some features should only be available if you upgrade, but the weekly view, really? Only planner that weekly view isn't part of the free app.",poor
"Gave it a test run and tried out the notifications. Didn't hear a thing. Also doesn't save new calenders. Bugs, perhaps? I'm not sure. Can't say I' be upgrading...",poor
"Looks great but since installing, my device only lasts half as long before needing a recharge. It appears to be constantly doing stuff in the background which uses battery power. I've never seen an app so busy. Shame.",poor
This app looked good until I had to purchase it just to get the week view. Now everytime I choose week view it crashes and stops working! I want a refund or a fix!,poor
It's OK!,poor
Can't load past notes it does work sometimes but I can't figure out how to get it to work,neutral
I would have rwnewed my annual subscriptuon if they had provided sync with windows laptop,neutral
Can be better for self organising,neutral
Ok.,neutral
"I like this app but sometimes it just closes and anything you were doing is not saved. Very annoying, and it happens on all 3 of my devices so I don't think it is a problem with the device",neutral
Not bad. Wish it happens the option for more tabs for notes,neutral
"Works with my Google calendars and has nice planner features. I gave it only three stars because I cannot change my calendar colors. I can change the colors in settings but the first time planner updates, the calendars change back to the default colors. I also paid for the original incarnation of this calendar that they abandon and went to this subscription based one. The version I had eventually stopped functioning as Android updated. I do not trust paying for this after that experience.",neutral
It's a great app but I wish you guys would arrange tasks based on their set time instead of be prioritizing them.,neutral
"The app has been good for showing my calendar and daily notes/journal on the same screen. I would like it much better if there was a backup/restore option, and if it was available across devices and platforms. I had to reset my phone recently and lost most of my daily notes. I have the pro version but will be canceling my subscription.",neutral
Use to track work things,neutral
"I've been using it for a while and really find it useful but it duplicates the tasks which is pretty annoying...i suddenly have to exercise 6 times a day XD...I guess that could be benefitial...but no, it's annoying really xD Will be glad to give it 5 stars once that stops happening",neutral
Really like the app. However it is multiplying my tasks on a daily basis and i cant delete them as fast as they appear... frustraring not using it right now,neutral
Good app. However the notification has stopped working.,neutral
"The app design looks nice, and has good features. This is a functional planner app. I can access the week view in the free version (though a prompt to upgrade to premium pops up), but tasks cannot be set as recurring in the free version. This is a main feature I'm looking for in a planner app. Also, the look of the app cannot be customized- stuck forever with that purple at the top of the screen. There are other free apps that include these things.",neutral
"I would give this app 5 stars but I am beyond frustrated with how slow it is to open. I pay the subscription for premium, and I love all the options in the app. But it literally takes 5 to 10 minutes for the app to open, unless there is a notification in my notification bar that I can open the app with. This would be annoying even with a free app, but to pay for a slow app that takes ages to open is ridiculous. In the 2 or 3 years that I've used it this has never been fixed with any upgrade.",neutral
G O O D,neutral
"This is hands down the best personal planning app I've ever come across. That being said, it's basically unusable on Android. The view jumps to the top of the day's task list at random, making it easy to accidentally check off the wrong task. It takes minutes to load anything when you try to access the rest of the app through the back arrow at the top left. And, on occasion, tasks will duplicate themselves multiple times with different parameters. I use it on my iPad with no trouble at all.",neutral
"App is extremely useful just that the ""search"" feature doesn't cover all the notes in the app",neutral
"Great app! Intuitive navigation, easy to use. Nice integration with other apps. What's up with the lavender color designation?! I didn't think that lavender would look turquoise.",neutral
"useful app, interface are easy to use, would be better if you could add search function, so we dont have to comb thru everything to find what we are looking for.",neutral
"I like how it allows me to set any number of reminders, minutes/hours/days/weeks in advance either by push notification or email. But many little bugs pepper this app. The calendar view will bug out and not map to the selected month from time to time. The location field tries to be smart by giving you a 'maps like' autocomplete, but this is annoying when you just want 'gym'. For some reason the first letter of an event name isn't registered by autocorrect, so 'Event' turns to 'venting'.",neutral
It's actually good but it doesn't have a feature where your task appears on your lockscreen that will remind you everytime you forgot something to do.,neutral
does not update tasks in widget automatically,neutral
"I need more time with your app. I'm looking for an organizing app to meet the needs of me and my gaming community to be able to cross schedule events share valuable information w/aarach. while I know that was never your vision I am impressed with the very easy to use ui, but have not figured out if u can share projects notes calandars ECT. I cam see your app meeting a very large need in a community the desperately needs an easy way to collaborate. adding a group's feature to cross plan 5 stars",neutral
Bought the planner pro.... Love the app... The down side is that the app did not sync... i have 2 device handphone and tablet both android... i have to update both device twice instead of once... Would give 4 or 5 star if it can sync between both device. i have some suggestion... maybe can input some bill tracker and some cute icon or pill tracker/ hydration icon.,neutral
Landscape mode only? Big problem. Cant make it portrait on my kindle fire 8,neutral
why won't my homescreen widget display all day events? this makes it really difficult to use,neutral
like the concept but tech support cannot get rid of ads and popups. tried over several months but they are gone a short while then return. the response lag and language issues are frustrating. this changed my review and I removed the app,neutral
"I love this app, it's the only one that looks and feels like the old Franklin planner, however; since the latest update I have a banner ad on the bottom of the screen with Google ads and I am a paid pro user. This is extremely annoying. If they don't remove this, I'm leaving.",neutral
I like this app but the ads are getting aggravating. Especially the Trump ads. I'd prefer not to see him on my phone. Thank you very much,neutral
"I found this app to be redundant, since I already have a calendar on my phone, and Planner Pro does little else.",neutral
"there are ads even though there wasnt any label of ""contains ads"" in this app description",neutral
it works it just hard,neutral
"Like everything about the app except, my events kept disappearing. I would enter an event and one would disappear.",neutral
"I have the app on my phone and my iPad and they do not communicate. Everything that I input on my phone, I have to re-input on my iPad. I'm signed into the same account on both. It would be nice if they would communicate. Also, I don't understand why the computer app is available separately and for a much more expensive price...",neutral
"There's a visible lag when scrolling left or right in day view, even in high end phones. Going back from a task edit screen without making any changes also asks (shows popup) whether you wish to save or discard changes, that popup is irritating. Otherwise an effective and the point app. Cheers!",neutral
Good,neutral
"Not able to sync with Outlook. Cannot create goals with a goal tracker, or 
export calendar events, tasks, or notes, and only accessible through phone 
and tablet. Much improvements needed for such a high subscription rate.",neutral
"It's good but since we always have more than 1 thing to do we write three 
or more things to do and when we go to priorities ex:C1 A4 B2 etc; we 
wouldn't know which to do so we suggest you have more of those .Thanks.",neutral
it's a nice app. it make my life displined,neutral
"Been using for a while now. Getting buggy, needs update",neutral
"Would be awesome except when I put start in weekly view in the settings, I can no longer access monthly view or change the settings ...",neutral
"Didn't realize this synced to my outlook calendar, started deleting work stuff and deleted two important appointments from my work calender. I'm screwed on those, was planning on using this for personal use only.",neutral
NYC,neutral
"When i tried putting inmy class scheduel they kept vanishing when I add notes to a specific date. It might work fine if you don't need many events, but it's a pain if you have a lot to keep track of",neutral
"It have future if they make Notes can be organize by category, Tasks can create sub task and fix bug when Samsung Dex enabled",neutral
"I downloaded this app on my tablet long time ago (full version) and recently also downloaded it on my phone as I don't bring my tablet with me all the time. I only use the ""task"" function, because  my  calendar events do not sync properly (I haven't fpnd the sync button on my phone...) and another not so funny thing for me: I am using the same account for both devices, BUT I can't use the full version on my phone (I get a message that I need to buy it (???)...) that's why I need to use my tablet (with the full version on it) if I want to add something.",neutral
"I love this app, but it sucks that I can only use it on my phone. I'd give it a 5 if I could a) use a desktop version of the app as well; b) sync tasks with Wunderlist;  and c ) sync reminders from Google Calendar as tasks on Planner Pro.",neutral
"Great app, but it keeps deleting the events (birthdays, etc.) that I put in it! I've never had this problem before, please do something! This is my go-to calendar app, and I'd hate to have to find a different one!",neutral
Won't do recurring tasks. Does not connect to Gtasks as shown in the cover photo. Hasn't been updated in a long time,neutral
It is ok,neutral
"Guys, excellent app. Bad financial model. Prepared to pay. Reluctant about  subscription model. Unfortunately, Uninstall.",neutral
Cant wait to try it,neutral
Loved it except that it wouldn't save and show me all of my events,neutral
Just downloaded this app.....not sure what I think of it at the moment.....cant seem to find where you can use colours like the pictures,neutral
It says I changed my password and now can't get in calendar what can I do to fix problems,neutral
"I like it but when I put my pass code in to access it,  I goes through but then it says your password has been changed please sign in, but I have to hit the back button on my phone to ignore it so it doesn't make me sign in again,  but when I do hit OK for it to let me sign in again, my password isn't there,  it's still locked but I don't know the password.",neutral
"I'll like it more if I can the way I view this apps, difficult for me to type in landscape position",neutral
So so. I expected the ability to attach files to notes and a lot more flexibility with format.,neutral
"Plz help, it says m typing wrong passcode, it is not opening with my old passcode",neutral
"The aap good but not some updates are required, such as - In notes section add photo upload option, Add Journal Option,",neutral
"Nice layout, but it will not sync repaired events between my tablet and phone. I contacted tech support but they were unresponsive and not helpful. I do not recommend.",neutral
"Forever Landscape? Why can't I ever get this app to rotate to portrait mode? It's never been able to do this, even after downloading it on other phones. Way too annoying to have to deal with for me to deem it a useful app, at least for me.",neutral
"It's fairly easy to use, however the alarm  doesn't  work",neutral
"Overall great organization tool, however recent updates make the application only usable in horizontal view which is extremely annoying and quite an inconvenience",neutral
The event didnt sync to my other device,neutral
"Love the app and bought the full version in February, but recently it quit syncing between my phone and my tablet. I emailed support about the issue on June 2. The tasks are syncing now, but calendar items still are not syncing.  Wish they would fix the issue!",neutral
Good,neutral
This app is easy to use but my biggest issue is that when i add notes or check off tasks when off line they dont save,neutral
"I liked the app and it looked like it had a good set of features, but I didn't like the $4.99/year recurring subscription fee.",neutral
"Task repeat options are garbage. For basic things it's ok, but don't expect more than that.",neutral
helpful but not too much,neutral
I liked the app well enough to pay for it so I could get my recurring items in order with it but when I set a task as recurring it only shows up on the day that I started with.,neutral
Great :),neutral
It worked great to start with but now I'm not getting task notifications and some of my events are not showing up on my calendar widget,neutral
"I like this app very much, because it's fairly easy to use and it allows for actual ring tones to be used; not just notification tones). However, my biggest issues are that I cannot receive any notifications from the planner if the event was created on my phone's calendar (I'm assuming this is the issue since only half, or less than half, of my total events and tasks do not sound). It also will not sound when I have reminders set for many different times. It's original default reminder is 15 minutes before the event time, but I changed it to be on time and then I would make other reminders if need be. It will only sound at 15 minutes before the event time, no matter what I tell it to do.",neutral
"I'm using this app for work for Due Diligence. When I first installed the app I was sure I could ""search"" my notes for key words now I can't. Am I doing something wrong or is that function not available on this app?",neutral
It does not have the ending time of an event,neutral
How can i take the notes i have made and copy them over to my laptop. I have looked to see where the notes save to but can't seem to find them anywhere. Please help me,neutral
"Whenever I open it i have to turn my phone sideways because it's locked in horizontal, even after I turn on auto rotate",neutral
Good app that I can use for putting all my appointments in. One problem is that the notifications I set to make sure it reminds me don't go off at all. (I have a Droid Turbo 2). If you guys could fix that. I will change to 5 stars.,neutral
"Hello developers, can you please help? I put a passcode on the app and now it won't let me access the calender. It keeps telling me that my passcode is incorrect when I know I put it in correctly. Please fix this",neutral
"No matter what I do, even setting 'no notifications' when creating event or task; they  continually pop up. Not happy with this feature.",neutral
A good app overall but the new version no longer shows the duration of events which is extremely annoying and a deal breaker for me.,neutral
"I love the app EXCEPT that the widget does not remember customizations (such as default calendar, not using 24 hour time). If this could be more flexible and keep the settings of the apps I would definitely rate five stars. It's helped save time having multiple uses for one app but I need the widget compatibility",neutral
The app no longer notifies me of my tasks!!! Please fix,neutral
It doesn't work well for repeated scheduling of regular tasks.  I have tried selecting every week or every 7 days and repeat either does not work at all or shows up only for the same day monthly not weekly.,neutral
I love it so far but is it usable over multiple devices? I am currently using it on my tablet and downloaded the app to my phone but when I try to sign in it says it can't find my email address.,neutral
Try,neutral
Its ok,neutral
Not being able to view my list of things to do or to get.,neutral
"Setting up late events (past 11pm) is literally impossible. Start and end times/days will shift randomly when I make a change to the other.  Whenever I do manage to get both right, I get a ""Same time"" error even though clearly the start and end times are different.",neutral
"I had several recurring events to keep track of my week, but after the update, they disappeared.",neutral
"Good design, but it's not exactly free if you have to pay for basic features, like reoccurring events.",neutral
"I purchased the paid version and I'm sort of disappointed. Every time I enter a task it adds the first letter of the first word over again so I have to change it each time (i.e. it will autocorrect to EEvery instead of Every). It is also kind of laggy. It could be a great app, but not as is.",neutral
"I suggest you add a ""deadline"" button instead of just tasks and events.. Personally that's the only reason I dont use it.. Is the classifications aren't enough..",neutral
"Needed:  Sync tasks. Color code events. And for goodness' sake, speed up! This is extremely slow.",neutral
"it's really unresponsive. I have to tap 3 times so something opens or to check a box or anything..  too bad, I really liked it but this is too annoying.",neutral
The app is making me sign in to an account but won't  let me sign in. Frustrated!,neutral
the reviews are sending a clear message to you. Act on them. I think the last update has messed everyone up. If you don't act;you're sending a message back:ie. you meant to mess everyone up by locking them out,neutral
This planner app is pretty clear and simple. I have the paid version and it works OK except today they had a glitch and I lost everything even when I reinstalled. It was just so screwed up!  So if you don't mind losing all of your work when they update... I guess it's survivable.,neutral
Add ability to have a dark theme.,neutral
Troublesome widget organization. When I tap a date it opens app to date previously open not new date needed. Very time consuming and creates booking mistakes when not careful.,neutral
"Love it, but it has some major flaws: (1) Can't personalize THEME. (2) Can't configurate WIDGETS' toolbars & what details are displayed. (3) The widget's size is too wide—max 4x?. Would love it if it were more flexible. (4) You cannot sort the notes on one day to be listed in ALPHABETICAL order on the Day widget; it will always be sorted by time. (5) The app malfunctions when you place two widgets on the home screen. (6) App stops working a lot for seemingly no reason.",neutral
Enjoyed it's use while it lasted. Uninstalled now.,neutral
Can't make calls from the app by clicking on the phone number like Google calendar,neutral
"Pro Version and it still won't handle the recurring tasks smoothly. Please fix it, I've restarted my phone several times and still nothing.",neutral
"The app would be nice and work well if it wasnt for this 1 issue but its a pretty big issue as far as daily planners go...It only shows half of a clock or calender in the create event/task subscreen meaning i can not select any times that would fall on the right hand side of the clock or I can not select a ""due by"" date  for tasks because the right side of the calender is missing...I would already own the full version if it wasnt for this problem",neutral
Crashing a lot after update,neutral
Уууу,neutral
"I just got the app, but I can barely use it because every time I click on something it redirects me to a page that asks me to upgrade for $4.99/yr. If it would just let me use the free version I might actually like it.",neutral
"This application was exactly what I needed when I first started to use it. Now there are a handful or problems- events are appearing twice, events get deleted or  not appearing at all after being saved, deleting one event and the reoccurring events get deleted, and not appearing on the selected reoccurring days. Very annoying.",neutral
Fix the widget bugs please,neutral
It's alright.,neutral
"Not a bad app pretty good, got a few things organized with it.",neutral
"There's nothing wrong with this app, although it could be slightly better, but.... It's just like Google Calendar. In fact, it's integrated with Google Calendar, and all your events show up in GC. Even the selections of colors in association to events and how you input information is the same. If you're an android user, go ahead and just use the built in Google calendar, if not your Samsung/HTC/whatever one. I have near stock android, so I get Google.  Same difference, really.",neutral
Overall good. A search feature would be great for notes. Thanks,neutral
"I used to love the app... Until I needed to synchronise to see my tasks to another device, then I found out syncing simply won't work and uninstalling/reinstalling didn't solve the issue.",neutral
"I bought this because it has a really design and features, but I to uninstall it because it's slow loading. It's lagging.",neutral
Have to go premium to have more features.,neutral
"Trying to sync my calendar with both my phone and tablet, and any notes and/or tasks are not syncing between my devices.  Having to duplicate these items is very frustrating.",neutral
It was ok,neutral
I love it. But too expensive.,neutral
The only thing not working is the reminder.. I'm using Huawei Mate8.. Can somebody help me how?,neutral
"Why did you show the checkboxes in widget when you can't even check/uncheck it via the widget? Its just so frustrating to go to the app just to check a list. Other than that, this app is good.",neutral
"Needs to give you the option of adding pictures when note taking. If it had this option would be excellent, otherwise not a bad app.",neutral
I use it mainly for its widgets. ONE THING THOUGH: please fix the widgets so that the they show the current date and don't stay put on the previous day unless manually changed.,neutral
Just getting used to it but so far not bad,neutral
"A bit disappointed,  bought a new phone and re-download ed the app, would not bring my calander in from my old phone and asking me to repay for the full version.",neutral
"But I miss the hourly blocks, made it easy to Sceduale my work hours.",neutral
It doesnt update between your calanders. I need a planner that stays up to date with my calendar changes. This is not it.  Waste of money.,neutral
"It is an OK app as far as personal entries are concerned and the connected functions of name, time and place. Can not count on it to keep you informed about set Calender Events though as they are set default in 2014. Mothers Day was on the 8th; 2nd Sunday in May this year; not Wednesday the 11th. They can thank my wife for keeping me informed. It is a scheduling app and if the default events are wrong as well as uneditable how confusing will your scheduling be? Keep an accurate calendar handy.",neutral
Why would I pay money to have recurring events in a planner. I think I'll stick with my default calander app,neutral
"Love this planner. But whenever I use the repeat function, I cant just edit 1 event. I have to edit the rest of the events that are linked together too. Would be great if I'm able to edit jus 1 event even when im using the repeat function. Would also be great if there's a copy and paste of events function! Would make things really easier! 😊",neutral
nice,neutral
Good integration with other calanders but not easy to read at a glance,neutral

I bought the allegedly better version it worked for about a month. I had all my scheduled stuff about 6 months and all of a sudden the disappeared which sucks.,neutral
"I prefer to use apps in portrait mode on my 7 inch phone/tablet (Huawei Mediapad X2, 1920*1200). When the keyboard pops up while adding a task, I can barely see what I'm typing because the screen height is greatly reduced in landscape.",neutral
I really liked it at first but it keeps turning on the alarm for my events even though I pressed no alarm I don't know how many times :(,neutral
"Wouldn't it be great if this app had also alerts instead of just notifications? It's easy to miss a notofication. Also, why can't we edit a specific day for a repeated event, but we have to edit also all future events or nothing?",neutral
Simple & feel like paper planner.,good
helpful with notes and events. no restrictions to enter everything like appointments,good
So far I like it very much. I use it daily and it helps me stay organized and focused.,good
Very efficient love it,good
Works pretty good for what I need it for. I was looking for a Franklin Day Planner look but this comes up on the day I put the reminder on in my calendar so it is helpful. It's working for me as a partial retired person.,good
"So far it is working, only just started using",good
It's ok. I have this app for several years. I don't like the advertisements.,good
I love this app. A couple of suggestions 1 for the repeat function I wish it had more flexibility such as an end date Since I am a visual person I would love it if the task list had color associated with the level of importance. But i do love this app so much that I upgraded,good
Excellent Application! Would've given 5 stars if the following want such a pain. Would like for it to be easier to remove a recurring event however. That seems to be an incredible pain. Otherwise I would recommend this app to everyone who is most comfortable with a realistic planner feel with a futuristic spin on it. Definite thumbs up. 🤗,good
Happy with it.,good
Great!,good
"Premium user here and I'm enjoying the app so far. I've had a hard time replacing an old app (my.poli) and this one seems to fit the bill. It's quite buggy at this stage and has limited features but functionality is great. I can see myself using it for the next 6months-1year. Hopefully, the devs keep improving the app.",good
I like the app but the user interface could be polished. The seems slightly delayed. A new look would be nice but over all a helpful app! Would still recommend,good
Good so far,good
"Really like this APP! Wish syncing across android and iOS was easier, but I have looked, and no other app has the style and versatility of Planner Pro. Well done Planner Pro folk!",good
Great app. Really needs a desktop capability.,good
Does it work in a laptop on the web?,good
"Ok, for a notepad, but not the most ideal if u like to be organized .",good
So far so good.,good
So far works great.,good
Love it,good
"I like the fact that I can put everything I need to do on the task list and it stays there forever, but then I have a small widget that just shows me what I am focused on in the moment so it is not overwhelming. I also like being able to prioritize my tasks in the a b and c categories. It is also good to be able to sync my calendars with my family's, but sometimes when I turn to the Calendar it has trouble displaying the multiple appointments especially if they overlap.",good
This is a decent app for keeping track events and appointments.,good
Nice,good
"The ease of use for everyday things is great, I have a note pad, task pad and calendar and I just set a task to call back a customer after hrs.. Sure it might note be a flashy business planner but if you just want something to remind you of events store something quickly for later reference, what more do you need, so far any ads haven't been intrusive the main reason people stop using these kind of apps",good
Any chance of getting a widget for the calendar????? Love the dark mode!,good
"Doesn't replace my default calendar but does have extra features that take it from ""calendar/scheduler"" to ""planner"". Great product.",good
Would be nice to have the ability to add more tabs......,good
Good app to use. I've been bullet journaling by hand but moving back to digital and this was the best I found to transition. Early days but so far so good,good
GOOD HELP,good
Good Planner Apps,good
Very good reminder,good
I would subscribe in the app if it supports right-to-left languages such as arabic. When I switch my mobile to arabic the text in the widgets mix up with buttons.,good
I have been using this app for years. What l especially like is the simplicity of use..,good
Easy to use app. Allows me to keep track of my busy schedule.,good
I like the app. I use the weekly planner widget thw most so it is easier to get organized. It syncs with Google calendar. The only reason I am not giving it a 5 stars is becauae after an update it stopped updating the week on my screen and I have to search for the right week everytime.,good
"If you're familiar with Stephen Covey's product suite, you'll find this tool to be an essential time management companion. The interface is similar to the paper based system. The application provides fields for tasks, events, etc. There are supporting priority and notification features aiding in the arrangement and alerting of tasks. The application would benefit from improvements with the synchronization of tasks across multiple devices.",good
Easy to navigate,good
Good Interface but recent tech issues. App slow to open.,good
Just using basic to track milage. Works fine.,good
"I like the app, and use it for everything. My one complaint is the search mechanism does not always work; I would like it to show all items that match the search request.",good
I love that the app interface is so easy to use. The reason I don't give it 5 stars is because you can't export notes. It would be ideal if that could be done.,good
"I'm using 2 calenders and 1 To Do planner not including this. All has their pros and functions I want, yet they're different in style. This is one of the best. I just love using the week view seeing at one shot, time of events laid out in planner, including notes on that day with pics uploaded if needed. It sync with my AnyDo planner which has a calender. But I just love how I can use this a bit differently for scheduling. Best if only it has a daily mood tracker added in the notes function.",good
"This is the only app that does what it does and I love the functionality. The only problem is the app is quite buggy and I haven't seen or noticed any updates in years. Would also be nice if there was a website to go with it. I am finally giving up and moving to day by day which leverages google calendar and google tasks. If google would just incorporate tasks into its calendar better, that would do it all.",good
Great app. I would rate it a 5 but there's an error where my completed tasks becomes unchecked constantly causing it to keep on becoming an unfinished task and it's annoying.,good
"I had a problem with upgrading to Premium. They were quick with their response and fixed the problem right away. It's a good app for those familiar with the Franklin Covey system, and syncs well across devices.",good
Good,good
"After purchasing the Pro Version and having used this calendar app for almost 2 to 3 years now, I have grown to truly love it. It mimicks as close to the Franklin Covey Planner's to any app out there I have found and this is what has drawn me to it. I am increasing my rating to 4 stars, because I have really had time to utilize all aspects of this calendar and I love that it will sink with my Google calendar and other calendars. I love this app, I only wish it could print.",good
great app,good
osm osm osm osm,good
Great app and the only flaw I see is that you can't yet export your data. Please make it so you can export data to something like pdf or something so I can save my entries forever,good
so far the best planner app i ever come across. room for improvement i.e. to be accessible on PC as if some other app does.,good
"Events sometimes take a while to show up on the day you selected for them, other times a certain day will not be selectable. choosing midnight as an ending time for an event doesn't seem to work.",good
"I love this app! I have the pro version and the layout is very clean and organized. However, only 4 stars because it does not work on multiple devices.",good
It is what I have looked for for some time. I wish it could sync'd across multiple devices.,good
I wish I could create notes without having to select a date. Otherwise so far so nice 🤓,good
"I do like the straight forwardness of this system it does what it says on the tin, needs to keep developing but in the theme it's in if it gets to clever like some systems it will loss it's position",good
Better to have a search option for notes,good
Very easy to use. Have all I need,good
"I would love this app so much more if part of the calendar wasn't obscured. 
I don't mind the week number or anything, I just wish I could see both it 
and the bottom of the calendar clearly.",good
It takes time burpt good but it keeps getting out like you can't login,good
"I don't quite get the categories for tasks, I hope there is an option to 
hide it or remove it.",good
"This app would be so much more useful to me if I could order tasks by time! 
Hope you guys can fix this thank you! Great app good job",good
"Cool app, seems to have all I need at this point. My only 2c would be that 
the widget weekly view should have the option to see the 7 days ahead 
rather than the current week; if it's a Friday, I don't really care what I 
did on Monday, I wanna know what's happening next Monday",good
"Just a couple of things .... I don't like the fact that the reminders show 
up multiple times and I wish it had a to do list but other than that ... 
But other than that so far so good",good
Great,good
Just installed and am liking it so far. I do wish there was a way to disable the quotes and better utilize that space to see more of my actual calendar. Also sub tasks would be very useful. With those changes I might actually be able to downsize the apps I use.,good
I just need notification  tone more than these and much more long,good
Seems like there is a bug when trying to sync my notes to my dropbox account. Would give you 5 stars if fixed.,good
Haven't found how to sync between two devices yet!,good
Good job,good
"Things were going great until I switched to a new phone .I can't find out how to sync my tasks and events to the new phone. I installed the app in my new phone and logged in, but the data is not there . I see that the events comes from the Google calendar, and I may be able to do something about that - but how do I sync the tasks ? Pls help.",good
Awesome,good
Great user interface. Easy to use. Syncing with Google calendar is a huge advantage. From To-do lists to events you can schedule anything.,good
I love this app.  I have always been a Franklin Covey planner gal and this is similar to the paper planner.  Great search function.,good
Great Tool,good
"I really like this app for the most part, but I really don't like how the month view in-app and on the widget don't actually list out what you have on that day, just colored dots. Would really like to be able to have this since I paid for the Pro version, please consider!",good
"I like this app. It has a lot of the features I use all in one place. However, even though it lists all my Google calendars, I can't figure out how to do anything with them. I have projects spread over a dozen calendars but I can't seem to add anything to any of them.",good
ItS pretty good.,good
Nice apps. But need to re download the full version.,good
"Great App, but would be good if you could edit tasks after you've written them.  Also would be good if it could have, a daily 'things to do list'on.calendar ,which could be ticked off alongside projects /tasks.",good
Overall a good app but I would also like the option of switching from landscape view.,good
Add alarms to notification in events or tasks and allow to add ringtone on it. Love it,good
"Great Very usefull, please add fitur search to find an old note",good
A great app. I just downloaded it and I already love it. The only issue here is slight ui bugs. November 2017 gets covered up by the tabs at the top and on the day section the date runs into the calender layout. Again great app but those errors make the app look less professional. I would recommend rescaling the fragments so they fit better on the page as well as the toolbar. Definitely am recommending to friends though,good
Good enaught,good
Ok,good
The perfect planner..Only thing missing is that Remimder is not working..,good
This app is great but maybe let us tick task we completed from widget as it's annoying the app will opened up when I pressed the box to tick what I've completed everytime,good
I think that feature of changing theme should be addef and apart from that there should also be a option for showing task on thr facr of calender itselg,good
I would like to be able to import my contacts to it. I would give 5 stars for that,good
The essence and notion of this application is not just to define activities from day to day basis but to remind us that its really not about perfection... Its about progress... This application teaches us not just to address holistically in our commitment and time management but also push drastically at the same time our attitude towards commitments.. Senior Project Engineer here... It really helps alot... Thank you.,good
"I really like this app - its a lovely interface, simple to use and very useful to have both tasks and notes with the calendar. Is there any possibility of adding a folder/tag/category function to the notes?  It would be so helpful - I make notes on a varietu of things as I go along, and its really useful to be able to store them by day, but it would also be great to be able to sort them by tags or folders. Anyway - just a suggestion. Otherwise a lovely app. Thanks :-)",good
"Awesome app! It helps me a lot to organize my life, work and other stuffs. The features are really amazing! Would recommend this to my friends and colleagues.",good
"Almost perfect. The only changes that would be helpful is a quicker way to switch from the week view to the task list. And i would like to see my tasks as a list by default instead of clicking on the task categories. Also I wish that you had a rollover option for tasks, I have yet to find an app that had this: basically I wish when I create a task I could choose if the task carries forward to the next day if not completed or not.",good
I like it,good
"I went a got the full subscription and I really like it so far, but I wish you could download it for your PC as well.",good
It's cool,good
I just downloaded this.  The free version was definitely useful but I went ahead and got the paid version because I wanted to use the repetitive tasks and weekly planner as well.  I definitely think this will be worth the purchase.,good
I really like this app and ised to love it until there was an update that was stopping me from using it without upgrading. If i had to pay a one time purchase thats one thing but an annual fee?? Give me a break. $5 for a planner app is reasonable if you use it all of the time but not every year. Yall are greedy.,good
"This app is great! But i have some suggestions that would even better improve the quality of using the app. for example, something like being able to edit the tasks widgets to show 'due soon' instead of just tasks for that day for even better planning.",good
"Great app!    Help,  I unfortunately forgot my password (I was very sure it's correct but I'm not sure why it says it's wrong). Is there anything that can be done about it?",good
This is a great planner app. Only thing missing is the ability to rotate into portrait or even rotate 180 degrees.,good
The app was working fine until I removed Google Now. Now the widgets will not show on home page.,good
planned not bad,good
"This is the app which I use for almost a year. There is one issue I have faced recently. Namely, some tasks and events do not synchronize on multiple devices where I installed the app. I'm using this app on my Android smartphone, as well as on iPad. I would be very pleased if you fix it.",good
Greatly improved comment from me.  MUCH better than a year ago.  Most updated lead to improvement.  Wish the ' want an annual subscription.,good
It's 👍,good
Almost all the functionality of the Franklin Planner. This is a great app!,good
The calendar reminders can be very shotty but the overall app is very useful,good
"This is a simple app, that gives me the capability of creating a to-do list, set event on my calendar and take notes...",good
It's a really great app,good
If only the calender icons cld stop piling up on the phobe task bar everytime one is due. So if I created 5 events to go off in an hr I'll have 5 icons piled up on my fone. It's not needed. Or at least put an option so people cld disable it if they don't want it.,good
Cool,good
This planner pro is very nice and better for you time schedule,good
Awesome app. Wish had auto sort feature of priority task like Franklin planner use to have.,good
Works great most of the time however crashes when making my display size small. Google pixel. Recurring error.,good
Nice app. But can update a function such as we can add in an attachment(like photo) into the task or etc will be better,good
"Would have given it 5 stars, but it doesn't seem to want to rotate when using my tablet.",good
"Very Helpful, The Best Yet !",good
"I like the app, very helpful for lots of things, however I've lost my account twice. I've had to uninstall it and recreate my account. Very good otherwise tho",good
I loved this app. Worked so great I purchased it. Now it has logged me out and says I don't exist.,good
I don't know. It works good and I like that you can add notes to the task that is very helpful. I just kind of would like to have a better weekly view. But all in all it gets the job done.,good
Like it a little even bought the pro version. But when I went to the website trying to find out how do you back up your data in the event something happens to your phone.,good
"I love this app and has been using it for more than a year, but lately it has bugs which changes the days when i opened it per-days. Please fix it",good
"It's a nice planner, I just prefer a different layout. I also don't care for the color.",good
"I just installed this gem of an app this morning, and love its ease of use. However, there is a minor problem...the date in big numbers on the left is one day behind the monthly calendar.",good
Great app and easy to use. Would be great if there was a no date option on notes for like shopping lists ect. That aren't just for the day.,good
"It's generally good, but screen rotation doesn't work. so, I can't use this app upside down in Galaxy Tab10. If this problem isn't solved, I won't pay for the next year. It would be great if this problem is solved!",good
it is helpful.,good
"Love the layout, and automatic carryover of tasks to next day.    One problem:  I have installed Planner Pro on my iPad and my Android phone.  The calendar events and tasks cannot be synced between my two devices.  Very frustrated.  Please add this sync feature soon.",good
However there are a few bugs. Every so often one of my recurring tasks will appear twice on one day and I have to delete it. The synchronization with drop box isn't good enough to use on two devices. I would be useful if you could choose 'third Sunday of every month' for recurring tasks,good
Good for studying,good
"I like this app and use it on my Android phone and iOS iPad. It's easy to use, don't need to buy anything, and is clear. I don't love how some tasks are harder to remember and the reminder isn't how I expected, but it's a good app.",good
Haven't been using this app for long but it seems great so far. I LOVE that incompleted tasks roll over to the current day. I just wish you could attach attach photos or files to your notes. That would make this a 5-star review.,good
Would love to be able to customize the app more.  Need to add a dark theme and also add an agenda view.,good
"A today button would be helpful in the week view widget, so that you don't have to scroll back. And also the possibility to add more accounts. Are these features available in the pro version? Maybe the possibility to try it  for a short period of time...",good
I liked it but is there a widget for the app?,good
Gud for organised businessman,good
App,good
Thanks,good
Good Features n Easy to Use,good
Plan daily schedule,good
This is what I have been finding ...,good
Why on earth when I'm on one day and create a task it schedules it for the day before that by default? just why?,good
This is one of my favorite app's,good
Amazing,good
"Takes a while to get used to. Could also use a ""daily"" reminder setting option.",good
NettyMac,good
"I love all the features, but its still missing an events widget to show on the main screen like the task widget. The planner gives me a feeling like it doesny care about events, it doesny have notification for it or a list out for it :( Is it possible to add the feature?",good
It was very useful for me to plan my days until the latest update which the widget shows the wrong day and I am unable switch the day..,good
This application is very useful in helping keep me organized and paced. The only suggestion I'd make is on the interface. When checking off my tasks for the day the add new task button is in the way of pressing the cross off button. It's a bit annoying but I love this app.,good
Love it!!,good
"I am the most unorganized person ever, and this app has helped me a lot. I constantly put down when my projects, tests, etc are due. I even include my days off on it. I also love that you can not down little notes with this app as well.",good
User friendly and plenty of bells and whistles. ; ),good
App shuts down somtimes,good
Can you add time in notes also like events,good
Easy to use.,good
its really good,good
Only thing I don't like is that when creating a recurring event the date doesn't show on the monthly view until you scroll over to the actual week of the event it would be a lot better if I could see those dates on the monthly view without having to scroll fix please for 5 star rating,good
"I finally found a easy, functional planner that reminds me with a message perfectly timed! I'm a set it and forget it planner that plans a month out. The messages keep me on task! Its tasks function is fluid enough that personal tasks can be added between as needed.",good
Extremely easy to use and exactly what I was looking for. LOVE the widget for this planner as well. I just wish the interface was a bit more aesthetically pleasing. Like a bit more sleek/modern?,good
"Helped me a lot to plan my workband stay organized,. I recommend it",good
Easy,good
I like it,good
5 stars if it were completely free :),good
Thanks for calander maker to hv realised that notes are necessary with task and calander. Then also necessary to hv online backup of those what hv been done. Not only the calander sync...its already well synced!,good
Quite helpful..helps me reach my daily targets,good
"Able to schedule, add notes, see monthly, weekly calendar.  Very good for on the go",good
I like it. Works well if you are use to the Franklin time management system.,good
Useful apps,good
Very useful.....,good
I paid for this application on my iPad. Now I am asked to pay for it on my Android to get the same features? Why do I have to pay twice for the same app? I hope the developers respond to me.,good
I loved the app but had to delete it because I couldn't choose which calendars I wanted to sync.,good
will be 5 stars if it can be backed up via cloud,good
Easy to use.  I like being able to add sub tasks and notes.  Still new to using it though.,good
Amazing,good
"Have only used it a little so far but really like it.  Busy with doctors appointments for Mum going through the cancer journey,  allows me to put in multiple appointments in the one day AND add notes.  Would have given it 5 stars but I am way too new to this to say that it is without fault.",good
Very practical but a bit sluggish,good
It connects to your phone calendar so its very useful for having more space to put notes and tasks,good
Nice,good
It is a nice and handy app to manage ur work,good
Up to now it pretty much feeds my necesities.,good
Great planner for me,good
I hop to make repeat task free,good
Links to all google calender,good
Good one,good
It's nice. But it doesn't grant my expectation. Need some improvement. But this is the best journal app I've ever downloaded,good
"Really like this, it does everything I want and need, so far 😊",good
It's a Great App,good
"Very useful, lives up to its promises so I am impressed and that hardly happens!!!",good
It helped so much,good
"This app help me with my time management, And staying organized",good
Easy to use,good
"Love this app!!!  😄   Only thing that bothers me is that when I put repeat on events, it only works sometimes.  So just make sure it actually fills in the reoccurring days that you choose.",good
I like more the design and how the calendar features are displayed on a same screen,good
I search diligently for an help to help me structure my time with the hope that it would improve my productivity. I found it with this planner. It really helps me to manage my time and stay focus on the assigned tasks or events,good
Great for 4x4 widget. Good daily calendar,good
خب,good
Widget wouldn't update. Please fix. That's the only flaw i guess,good
Great 👍 app!,good
"I like using it, my way of keeping track of different things.",good
Very easy and quick to use. No clicking thru a dozen screens to get what I need.,good
I love it,good
Terbaik,good
Helps me to stay organized during nursing school better than anything else I have tried.,good
It's simple with a clean interface. Does the job.,good
This Planner Pro is exactly what's needed to keep me on track of my daily activities. Easy to use. Reminds me of each upcoming event. No longer rely on paper generated planners. Highly recommend.,good
"Nice App, I am loving it",good
Looking forward to learning what this app can do.,good

"This app really helps me stay organized and keep track of what I have to do for school, because I am taking all AP classes, and have ADHD",good
"I have been using Planner Pro for several years. I like this organizer much better than others I've tried. I don't like the ones that come with the phones. Planner Pro works better, for me, with my Samsung Notes than with my LG's. The calendar is clean and well organized. I can have several different calendars all working together or separately, ie work, family, personal, groups, and volunteer. I definitely recommend the Planner Pro. Plus it works well with my Gmail calendar.",good
Works for me,good
تطبيق ممتاز واكثر من رائع,good

Great app and great tech support too.,good
Love this application works better than the calender app that came with my phone!!!,good
"This has been my go-to planner for a few years. I use it for everything, and it has never failed me. I love that you can set multiple reminders with notifications or emails at particular timepoints before an event. You can add a location to each event or task, invite people to events, and set priorities for tasks. The app also has a ""notes"" feature...I can't say enough good things about this app. It keeps me put together. Thank you to the developers!!! 💯💯💯",good
I haven't had a chance to use all the options available yet. So far I am satisfied with it.,good
"Super useful tool that integrates with pre-existing calendar info you have. Allows you to coehesively plan your day to day tasks and worklife in the priority you determine. Notes, dates, appts., calendar, tasks, projects; this is really an all in one!!! After 2 days of use, I bought the lifetime one time purchase. Cheap, worth it!",good
Great app. Helps me to keep my life organised. User-friendly.,good
Helps keep track of important things,good

I have used this several years as my primary calendar. Easy to use and see entries for each day,good
I have been using this app for years now. I like that it connects to all my other calendars (Gmail etc.) and that I can choose which calendars I want synced at any time. I highly recommend this app.,good

Love this app. Posts on my home screen ( with a widget) so I see my appointments at all times. Easy to use..,good
"This is by far the best Day Planner App I have found, and I have tried most of them! Having your Tasks and Calendar all together in the one place really suits the way I like to work. It also means you are less likely to miss something because you didn't check you Task App or Calendar that day. Sure there are a couple if things I'd like to see added, but you can say that about almost any App!",good

"You win, take my money. I have been using this app for many years and never bought the upgrade. I recently upgraded to the S10, and between Bixby, Google, and many planning apps, I just couldn't separate myself from this one. I simply have not found an app that's easier to add and complete tasks. Also the task widget is just hands down better than every other one out there. So fine, if you want to add fullscreen ads (and have the audacity to include sound) then take my money you can have it.",good
