Bank Churn Prediction Using Neural Network

Business Context:
Businesses, particularly banks, must address 'Customer Churn' - the issue of customers switching to competitors. Identifying key service factors influencing this decision is vital, allowing management to focus on targeted service improvements.

Objective:
Build a neural network-based classifier that can determine whether a customer will leave the bank or not in the next 6 months.
